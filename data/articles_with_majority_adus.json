The line ''showcases classic American style, accented with a touch of formal refinement,'' which presumably is how they do things in Katonah, where Ms. Stewart owns a 153-acre estate.\n        What it showcases, actually, is a classic American spitting match, accented with a touch of formal resentment. The crass and the decorous are combined to splendid effect in this battle between residents of a well-to-do Westchester hamlet and their neighbor Ms. Stewart, who was inspired by the region's ''beautiful'' topography to register the name Katonah as a trademark for a line of home furnishings, furniture, paint and lighting products.\n        And such a line it is, judging from one Web page we saw: ''Dynamic visual details give our antique-inspired pieces an entrancing sense of movement. The expansive Carriageway Landscape Dresser contains 10 drawers whose sterling silver-plated pulls are rakishly offset. It shares with the Carriageway Tall Dresser carved bracket legs and a lovely upswept veneer. The same veneer lends vibrancy to the stately crown molding and arches of the Carriageway Armoire.''\n        But the citizens of Katonah aren't complaining about gibbering ad copy. What they don't like is having their village's identity stolen by a brand name, and they've been raising money to fight Ms. Stewart in court. The battle has been simmering since the beginning of the year and has now been joined by members of an American Indian tribe, the Ramapough Lenape Nation, who resent what they consider Ms. Stewart's exploitation of their 17th-century ancestor Chief Katonah.\n        If exploitation it is, Ms. Stewart is hardly an innovator. America is a bristling forest of brand names that harness history and romance to the engines of commerce. American Indians are particular targets -- all those Pontiacs and Cherokees -- but towns and cities are not exempt, as anyone who eats cream cheese knows.\n        It seems unlikely that Katonah (the hamlet) will either vanquish or be much harmed by Katonah (the brand). People who live there and want to get on with life may end up just having to avoid certain magazines, TV programs and furniture departments. They can console themselves with knowing what a great divide separates their lives from those of people like Ms. Stewart, who made and therefore must inhabit a sprawling, meticulously tended universe of perfected quasi-reality, in which everything is on display and everything is for sale.\n        They might also consider moving to a place like Yonkers or Jersey City, which may never have to worry about having their identities appropriated by people hawking Chippendale chinoiserie.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1845399,"ids":1845399,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"A $141,000 salary seems generous, but for judges in New Jersey it is unrealistically low. Unless the Legislature acts soon to raise it substantially, the state's judiciary, which legal scholars have long rated as one of the nation's best, will decline in stature as fewer and fewer top lawyers will be interested in serving.\n        Already, there are disturbing signs. Of the 73 judges who left in the last three years, 47 stepped down before the mandatory retirement age of 70, and Chief Justice James Zazzali says the relatively low salary is impeding efforts to recruit replacements. He says the salaries of New Jersey's judges rank 41st in the nation in terms of earning power and that this is causing a ''morale crisis'' among existing judges.\n        The problem is compounded by the fact that judges in New Jersey are prohibited by the state's constitution from earning any outside pay from teaching, making speeches or writing books.\n        Unlike New York, where most judges are elected, state judges in New Jersey are nominated by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate. Upon serving for seven years, they must be re-nominated and confirmed; if they are, they can serve until age 70.\n        Although the workloads of judges have increased, their pay has not been raised since January, 2000, when the Legislature increased the salary in three annual steps. Until about 20 years ago, salaries of New Jersey judges were increased roughly in tandem with judicial pay on the federal level, but U.S. district court judges currently earn $165,000, which the Supreme Court's Chief Justice, John Roberts, says is also far too low.\n        Appellate court judges in New Jersey earn $150,000, Supreme Court justices, $158,500, and the chief justice, $164,250.\n        At a time when a graduate fresh out of Rutgers or Seton Hall law schools can make $130,000 or more and partners in many New Jersey law firms are earning upwards of $400,000, it is only natural that prospective judges would question the relatively low judicial salaries. In fact, a few of the state's judges have given up their state positions and increased their earnings by taking several part-time municipal court judgeships.\n        State judges, of course, get significant rewards in terms of status and respect and should expect to make a certain financial sacrifice when they go on the bench. But as Mr.Zazzali maintains, the current level of pay demands ''too much of a sacrifice.''\n        Gov. Jon Corzine has included a 5.6 percent judicial pay hike - about $8,000 for trial court judges - in his proposed state budget, and that would be a start. But to attract high-quality judges, the Legislature will have to quickly follow that increase with a more substantial boost. It must also enact a system in which judges would get raises on a regular basis, without being dependent on the whims of legislators.\n        No employee who performs satisfactorily should be expected to work for several years without a pay hike, and judges should not either. Why would anyone expect that as the earning power of judges declines, the quality of those on the bench will not decline with it?","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1677322,"ids":1677322,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"A State Supreme Court judge yesterday removed one important roadblock to construction of the ill-advised Jets stadium in Manhattan. It was a disappointing decision, but far from an ultimate win for the project's supporters. The governor and two top legislative leaders each have the chance to stop a plan that is a bad deal for taxpayers, mass transit users and New Yorkers.\n        Opponents of the stadium plan argued unsuccessfully in court that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns development rights to the Far West Side site that the Jets covet, failed to get the best price, selling the rights for only a quarter of the appraised value of nearly $1 billion. The plaintiffs plan to appeal, and several other lawsuits on environmental issues are pending. Meanwhile, many fundamental questions about the stadium plan, including financing and security, remain unanswered.\n        Politically speaking, the next stop is the Public Authorities Control Board -- a normally off-the-radar panel controlled by Gov. George Pataki, Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker. The stadium cannot go forward without unanimous board approval of $300 million in state subsidies. The board is scheduled to meet soon, perhaps today. If a vote occurs, the governor's support is a given. But Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno have each expressed reservations about the stadium.\n        Saying no will require a show of strength from the legislative leaders, who have been barraged by high-pressure sales pitches and threats from construction unions, political allies and Olympics boosters. But Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno should do the right thing and vote to block an outrageous misspending of taxpayer funds. The Jets' plan for a $2 billion-plus (the price keeps rising) football stadium remains too amorphous, and the public -- who may end up contributing more than $1 billion in total subsidies -- has been surgically cut out of the process.\n        Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno may be as close as New York voters come to having a say. Mr. Silver in particular must know how his city constituents would feel about having the mass transit system deprived of the best possible return on the sale of the development rights just when the creaky subways are most in need of money.\n        The football stadium -- no matter how it is camouflaged as a ''multi-use'' facility -- is not an Olympic stadium. It is a football stadium. Its main function will be as the home field of the Jets. The Olympics are a long shot at best, and politicians should not be held responsible for organizers' failure to come up with a sensible stadium plan. The city's whole Olympics pursuit is like a Saturn V rocket: once it has helped to launch the Jets' ambitions, it can fall away, having achieved its purpose.\n        The only conscionable answer to all of that is a resounding, unequivocal vote of ''no.''","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1818732,"ids":1818732,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"A battle between Yonkers and its neighbors over Ridge Hill Village, the $600 million residential, retail and commercial project the city wants to build near its border with the Town of Greenburgh, has gone quiet.\n        All sides have now settled a lawsuit that accused Yonkers of conducting an inadequate environmental review in its rush to greenlight the project, which will include 1,000 homes, 1.3 million square feet of retail space and who knows how many cars barrelling -- or crawling, as the case may be -- along the roads in and around it, including the Sprain Brook Parkway, the New York State Thruway and Tuckahoe Road.\n        As settlements go, it doesn't offer much for Yonkers's adversaries. Greenburgh, Hastings-on-Hudson, Ardsley and some residents of Yonkers itself had complained that traffic from Ridge Hill would engulf their streets. They wanted the city and the developer, Forest City Ratner (which is also building The Times's new headquarters in Manhattan), to scale back.\n        But that didn't happen. About all the settlement calls for is $5 million to mitigate traffic at certain intersections, and the creation of a task force to jointly lobby Westchester County and New York State to ease the traffic problem once and for all by creating a direct link to Ridge Hill from the Sprain Parkway.\n        Many people can support this solution in theory, but the obstacles to building it are significant. This is partly because the multimillion-dollar system of ramps and exits envisioned by the Yonkers City Council President, Chuck Lesnick, would have to cross a Westchester County park, and the county says it will sacrifice precious parkland to Ridge Hill at about the time hell freezes over.\n        In addition, the county has already raised serious questions about the scale and design of the so-called village, which it considers a closer cousin of a megamall. It insists further that offering a parkland boon to a private developer would set a catastrophic precedent with other builders and at other parks. The task force can lobby all it wants, the county says, but the Sprain Parkway ramps are roads to nowhere.\n        We love the idea of a regional task force -- of neighbors joining neighbors, crossing borders and putting heads together to solve development challenges that would otherwise lead to the usual endless and tiresome Westchester border wars.\n        But in the case of Ridge Hill, where so many problems could have been solved early on, with the City of Yonkers simply listening to its neighbors and working with Forest City Ratner to create a project on a more manageable scale, the great d\u00e9tente appears to have come too late.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1844646,"ids":1844646,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"A bill headed for a vote in the Senate would usher in much needed reforms at the Food and Drug Administration. But it also risks making the agency even more dependent on funds from the industry it regulates.\n        The measure, sponsored by Senators Edward Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Michael Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, would help rectify the agency's most glaring weakness: an inability to crack down on dangerous prescription drugs whose adverse effects are discovered only after they have been widely used and many people have been harmed. The F.D.A. currently puts far more money and staff into approving new drugs than it does into monitoring them after they are on the market, and it lacks the legal authority to do much about hazards discovered at that stage.\n        So it is salutary that the new bill would pump more money into postmarketing regulation and push the agency into a more active role in searching vast databases for adverse drug effects. For the first time, the agency would be given the power to require postmarketing studies, and it could fine companies that refused to comply.\n        These and other improvements, however, would come at a stiff price: an ever greater reliance on the user fees paid by the companies. The fees were first imposed in 1992 so the agency could hire additional staff members to speed up the approval process and reduce a backlog of applications. In that respect, they were a rousing success. But over the years the fees have increased at a faster rate than appropriations. Today industry pays more than half of the cost of the agency's drug reviews. And the new bill would set the fees on a trajectory that could reach 70 percent in coming years.\n        This is a dangerous dependency for an agency that regulates such a critical part of the nation's health care system. It's as if the nuclear utilities paid for oversight by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The potential for abuse in a such a chummy atmosphere is clearly there.\n        Industry representatives have enormous say in confidential meetings over how high the fees will be and what activities they will support. The tight deadlines for agency action set by the user fee law have sucked money and staff from important research and training. One recent study found that drugs approved in a rush to meet deadlines subsequently encountered more safety problems than drugs approved with less deadline pressure.\n        Unfortunately, the fees have become such a big part of the overall F.D.A. budget -- roughly 20 percent of the total -- that it would be difficult to eliminate them without making budget deficits worse. Perhaps the best course would be to reauthorize the fees for two years, not the five written into the current Senate bill. The F.D.A., the White House and Congress should then use the time to figure out a way to wean the F.D.A. from its risky dependency.\n        Editorial\n        Correction:  May 10, 2007, Thursday  A May 3 editorial on ''Reforming the F.D.A.'' inaccurately suggested that nuclear utilities do not pay for oversight by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

But it may not address one of the most glaring vulnerabilities: chemicals traveling by rail. The House has voted to include restrictions on rail transport of deadly chemicals, but the Senate has not.\n        If Congress is serious about protecting against terrorism, it will include the House provision in the final bill.\n        If terrorists attacked a chlorine tank as it traveled through downtown Washington, or another city, it could produce a toxic chemical cloud that would put the lives of hundreds of thousands of people at risk. Terrorism experts agree that rail cars filled with chemicals are an easy target. And the recent attacks on trains in Europe, and the use of chemicals in attacks in Iraq, should put America on notice about the seriousness of the threat.\n        The only real way to avoid that grim possibility -- and the frightening likelihood of mass casualties that could come with it -- is to require railroads to route dangerous chemicals away from densely populated areas. Representative Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced a good bill that includes reasonable provisions for rerouting hazardous chemicals.\n        The requirements would not be onerous or expensive. Only a small percentage of shipments would be affected -- the ones with the most dangerous chemicals, like chlorine and propane. There are plenty of rail lines that bypass populated areas, and it is not difficult to reroute individual cars. It is an indication of the bill's moderate, common-sense approach that it passed the House with broad bipartisan support.\n        Unfortunately, the Senate failed to pass its own version of the Markey bill, which was sponsored by Joseph Biden, Democrat of Delaware. A main reason the Biden provision failed was lobbying by the chemical industry, an enormous contributor to political campaigns. The industry seems to believe that even after Sept. 11 and the recent rail and subway attacks in Europe, it should not be subjected to meaningful new government safety regulations.\n        Especially when deadly chemicals are involved, rail security is too important to leave to the good will of the businesses involved.\n        When Senate and House conferees meet to hammer out a final version of the broader homeland security bill, they will have to choose between looking out for the convenience and bottom line of industry and safeguarding the lives of Americans.

Their balanced and thoughtful report, prepared over six months, features an unsparing analysis of the U.N.'s current problems and weaknesses. It also offers constructive recommendations on mobilizing Washington's powerful influence to promote urgent and necessary reforms, including some already proposed by the U.N. itself.\n        Lawmakers should take the time to at least thumb through this report, especially those who have been demanding Secretary General Kofi Annan's resignation, supporting the ill-conceived nomination of John Bolton as the United States ambassador to the United Nations and backing the latest benighted attempt to withhold America's legally obligated dues.\n        The task force report offers useful proposals on restraining nuclear and other weapons proliferation, and on peacekeeping and peace-building, human rights, economic development, and strengthening the U.N.'s badly discredited management systems. It offers more than 100 specific recommendations, and while we do not agree with every one, we can readily endorse most of them.\n        The most important include the creation of an independent audit and oversight board, more militarily robust peacekeeping operations, strengthened access and inspections rules for the International Atomic Energy Agency and other international bodies monitoring the proliferation of unconventional weapons, and stronger cooperation between the United Nations and the World Bank.\n        It also usefully calls for stronger measures to prevent and punish sexual abuse by peacekeepers; enhanced protection for whistle-blowers; American leadership in preventing genocide, starting with Darfur; and United States support for regional war crimes tribunals and truth commissions.\n        Along with its deserved criticism of U.N. problems, the Gingrich-Mitchell report refreshingly notes that many of the charges commonly leveled against the United Nations -- for example, its failure to halt genocide and other threats to humanity and peace -- should more properly be directed against those member states that blocked or undermined effective international action.\n        It also takes note of the ambitious reform agenda proposed earlier this year by Mr. Annan and specifically embraces some of its ideas, like replacing the morally bankrupt Human Rights Commission with a more credible Human Rights Council and creating a new peace-building commission to follow up on the work of peacekeeping missions.\n        When a United Nations summit meeting convenes in New York this summer to discuss and build on the secretary general's proposals, the United States should take a leading role.

The panel has found persuasive evidence that Benon Sevan, who ran the program, used his influence with Iraq improperly to help a small company gain profitable rights to sell Iraqi oil while he was simultaneously urging the U.N. to provide greater help in rebuilding Iraq's oil equipment. That was a clear conflict of interest that raises the possibility that Iraq bribed Mr. Sevan. If the allegations are true -- Mr. Sevan claims that he is being scapegoated -- they would constitute the first real evidence of corruption at high levels of the program.\n        But whether this amounts to small-scale corruption by a greedy official or a large-scale subversion of the entire program is not clear. Nothing in this initial report gets at the core element of the scandal: how was Iraq able to manipulate the program to amass perhaps $2 billion in illicit revenues to sustain the regime and buy embargoed goods?\n        The most disturbing findings, according to Paul Volcker, the panel's chairman, are that Mr. Sevan, a Cypriot, asked senior Iraqi officials to grant oil allocations to Africa Middle East Petroleum, a small company owned by a distant relative of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former U.N. secretary general, and was evasive in answering questions about it. The company resold the allocations for a $1.5 million profit. The report does not charge that Mr. Sevan profited personally, but it notes that he claimed to have received $160,000 in cash from an aunt, an elderly woman who lived modestly and would not plausibly have big wads of cash to give away.\n        During this period Mr. Sevan also urged the U.N. to increase the funds for oil-machinery repairs in Iraq and release ''holds'' put on oil parts destined for Iraq. The report stops short of accusing him of taking a bribe to do Iraq's bidding, possibly because he had long sought to rebuild Iraq's oil facilities and might have championed that cause even without the oil allocations. But Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was shocked at Mr. Sevan's behavior.\n        The other major charge in the report is that the U.N. violated its own competitive bidding rules in hiring three major contractors. That seems undeniably true, but how heinous it is remains murky. Mr. Boutros-Ghali, then the secretary general, for example, picked a French bank to handle the program's escrow account because Iraq wouldn't accept an American bank and the United States opposed using a Swiss bank that was deemed the top choice by U.N. procurement officials.\n        The choice of a Dutch company to inspect oil shipments out of Iraq and of a British company to inspect imports of humanitarian goods also violated U.N. bidding procedures. The Dutch may have been favored because they were deemed tough on enforcing sanctions, and the British may have been chosen to spread the contracting around. Whatever the motivation, the U.N. official most centrally involved faces disciplinary action.\n        Still to come are a report on the role of Kofi Annan's son in working for a contractor and a final report that will delve into the sensitive issue of whether members of the Security Council knew that Iraq was getting illicit revenues from the oil-for-food program and separate trade protocols but did nothing to stop it.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1832538,"ids":1832538,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"A court battle over the right to demonstrate on Central Park's Great Lawn has underscored an astounding fact.

It's an inadequate and distressing rationale, and we hope that the lawsuit will remind the city of the importance of making space for large gatherings where New Yorkers can exercise their right of free speech.\n        Public parks are especially precious in New York City, where concrete and mortar predominate. Central Park, at 843 acres of green, is often called the city's lungs. But it is also its vocal cords. The Great Lawn, with 13 acres of open space, is the most suitable site for large rallies in Manhattan. It has been the site of some spectacular events, like the 1982 ''No Nukes'' rally and the 1995 Mass with the pope, both of which drew more than a hundred thousand people.\n        Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants to put an end to such gatherings. Since around the time of the 2004 Republican convention, when the city repeatedly denied protesters the right to gather in Central Park, his administration seems to have had a wild fixation on saving every blade of the Great Lawn.\n        There is no denying that the city's investment of $18 million, much of it from wealthy park neighbors along Fifth Avenue, has made for some impressive improvements. But the right way to protect the park is to require groups that want to use the Great Lawn to post bonds to pay for any damage, something the groups suing the city were willing to do.\n        The lawsuit also calls attention to the uneven way the city applies its rules. It's telling that while the New York Philharmonic and its well-heeled subscribers have had no problem securing the Great Lawn for concerts, there hasn't been a rally there in years. Classical music fans are just as capable of flattening grass as critics of the White House.\n        With Central Park off limits, the city has proposed that rallies of more than 50,000 people be held on the Parade Ground in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx or the Long Meadow at Brooklyn's Prospect Park. It's an interesting suggestion from a mayor who wanted to build a professional football stadium right in Manhattan because he thought the other boroughs were too remote.\n        The mayor's solution might make tending the grass in Central Park easier.

''Assault rifle'' is a much touchier term. It is generally understood to be the kind of gun that soldiers use in wars and terrorists use on the evening news. But the gun lobby despises ''assault rifle,'' considering it a false, scary label tacked onto perfectly legitimate weapons by people who want to take away others' rights.\n        That is a debate for another day. The question for now is whether the hunter, Jim Zumbo, deserved what he got after he wrote on his blog that hunters, especially those who hunt small mammals, should shun what he called assault rifles -- semiautomatics like the AR-15, a cousin of the M-16, and civilian knockoffs of the AK-47. ''Excuse me, maybe I'm a traditionalist,'' he wrote, ''but I see no place for these weapons among our hunting fraternity.'' He added: ''To most of the public, an assault rifle is a terrifying thing. Let's divorce ourselves from them. I say game departments should ban them from the prairies and woods.''\n        Until then, Mr. Zumbo was one of the most admired hunters in America, a widely read magazine writer with a cable TV program and lots of lecture appearances and corporate sponsorships. He of all people should have known that ''ban'' is the mother of all fighting words to gun zealots. His 250-word posting caused a huge eruption on gun blogs, and Mr. Zumbo instantly became their second-most-hated man, after the gun-control advocate James Brady. Though Mr. Zumbo quickly disavowed his words and apologized, he lost his blog, was dumped by Outdoor Life magazine and was disowned by the National Rifle Association, after 40 years of membership. His corporate sponsors, including the gunmaker Remington, ditched him. His cable show was canceled. The N.R.A. issued a chilling statement warning Congress to take heed of Mr. Zumbo's fate. By the time Blaine Harden told his story in The Washington Post, Mr. Zumbo was professionally dead.\n        The paranoia and gloating that Mr. Zumbo's name has evoked on gun discussion boards like ar15.com and freerepublic.com speak for themselves. You will find only a handful of postings suggesting cautiously that the overnight destruction of a man's career might not be the proudest moment for the advocates of gun rights. One or two say that instead of cementing their reputations for reflexively enshrining gun ownership above everything, they might have asked Mr. Zumbo what he was talking about. They might even have had a healthy debate.

It cries out for prompt reversal by the full circuit, and ultimate rejection by the Supreme Court.\n        The district's strict gun-control law bars all handguns unless they were registered before 1976. The law was challenged by a guard at the Federal Judicial Center, who was permitted to carry a gun on duty and said he wanted to keep one at home.\n        The outcome turned on an interpretation of the Second Amendment, which says, ''A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.''\n        The key legal precedent is a 1939 decision in which the Supreme Court concluded that the amendment protects the private ownership of guns only when it has ''some reasonable relationship to the preservation of efficiency of a well-regulated militia.'' By not viewing the amendment as creating a basic individual right, the decision left room for broad regulation of gun ownership.\n        Unfortunately, that did not deter last week's two-judge majority from adopting exactly the opposite interpretation, which is favored by the National Rifle Association and the Bush administration. Written by Judge Laurence Silberman, a Reagan appointee, and joined by Judge Thomas Griffith, named by President Bush, the decision says the Second Amendment's right to bear arms belongs to individuals and is ''not limited to militia service.''\n        On that basis, the judges invalidated portions of the district law prohibiting city residents from having handguns in the home, and requiring that shotguns and rifles be stored with trigger locks or disassembled. In her dissenting opinion, Judge Karen Henderson, an appointee of the first President George Bush, duly criticized her colleagues' brushoff of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling.\n        The new decision jeopardizes sound legal precedent and the district's law.

But it also showed that not all charter schools are created equal.\n        On average, charter schools that were affiliated with public school districts performed just as well as traditional public schools. That may be a disappointment to advocates who expected them to show clear superiority. But the real stunner was the performance of free-standing charter schools, which have no affiliation with public school systems and are often school districts unto themselves. It was this grouping that showed the worst performance.\n        Free-standing charter schools often bite off more than they can chew. The presumption is that without the bureaucratic restraints of the public school system and the teacher unions, charter schools can provide better education at lower cost. But the problem with failing public schools is that they often lack both resources and skilled, experienced teachers. While there are obvious exceptions, some charter schools embark on a path that simply recreates the failures of the schools they were developed to replace.\n        Charter school advocates denounced the new federal study even before it was released and took issue with its methodology, which is not perfect. But this study does not stand alone. The evidence so far shows that charter schools are not inherently superior to the traditional public schools they often seek to supplant -- and that they are sometimes worse.\n        One advantage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 was the wave of education studies it started. They offer hope that Congress will look at the record when it considers reauthorizing the law next year. If it does, lawmakers will back away from the part of the act that offers charter schools as a cure-all. They should instead home in on the all-important but largely neglected issue of teacher training and preparation -- which trumps everything when it comes to improving student achievement.\n        These studies argue for a more nuanced federal policy that does not just advocate wholesale charter conversion but instead defines and supports successful models only. Beyond that, Congress needs to grasp the obvious, which is that the quality of the teacher corps is more crucial to school reform than anything else. The original law required states to provide highly qualified teachers in core subject areas by this year. But the Education Department simply failed to enforce the rule, partly because of back-channel interference by lawmakers who talked like ardent reformers while covering up for state officials clinging to the bad old status quo.\n        Four years later, the national teacher corps is still in a shambles. Until Congress changes that, everything else will amount to little more than tinkering at the margins.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1840421,"ids":1840421,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"A first look at the drawing of the latest development proposal for the Yonkers waterfront is likely to elicit the kind of reaction a puzzled parent gives a bright-eyed toddler with paint-smeared fingers. ''This is interesting, sweetie. Am I holding it right-side up?''\n        But then it hits you that this is serious -- that the little brown smudge near the bottom is the shell of a real building, the abandoned Glenwood Power Station; that the hulking mass of quilt triangles and gridwork looming above it is a condominium complex designed by a real British architect, Will Alsop; that a real New Jersey developer, REMI Companies, of Hoboken, N.J., wants to throw it up for $250 million, and that the people who run the City of Yonkers might just be inclined to let that happen.\n        But the main problem with this project, which is thankfully in the early stages of approval, is not its debatable aesthetics. It's the scale -- 25 stories for the main residential tower, far higher than the abandoned power plant's existing smokestacks, which the developers plan to snip off. The plan is huge and intrusive and strikingly out of whack with the kind of reasonable, human-scale development that should be the central elements of any master plan for a city blessed with such a precious quantity of land along such a cherished river.\n        When you add this new project to the others bubbling along in Yonkers -- the $3.1 billion partnership of Stuever Fidelco Cappelli to build massive amounts of housing and offices and a ballpark downtown, and Forest City Ratner's Ridge Hill mini-city to the north -- you get the impression that the city's eagerness to throw itself open to splashy development has trumped caution and patient good sense.\n        It's understandable that Yonkers officials want to get moving on redeveloping stagnant properties in their promising but underachieving city. It's impressive that the developers and architect have gone so far out of their way to imagine a complex that is so environmentally friendly, with rooftop windmills providing all its power and solar panels heating its water. And it's wonderful that they want to include a contemporary art museum in the mix, instead of the usual lame assortment of high-end retail shops and services.\n        But all the eco-friendly attributes and all the chic extras amount to nothing if they blind the city to an oversized hulk that will squat by the river for generations, blocking light and diminishing public enjoyment by its massiveness. There are a lot of precious attributes of the Hudson waterfront that are easy to overlook in a developer's proposal -- light and air, public access, the matchless view.

The study compared five drugs used to treat schizophrenia and found that most of the newest, most heavily prescribed drugs were no better than an older drug that is far cheaper. The nation is wasting billions of dollars on heavily marketed drugs that have never proved themselves in head-to-head competition against cheaper competitors.\n        The whole class of antipsychotic drugs has had undeniable value in blunting the symptoms of schizophrenia, enabling many patients to leave mental hospitals and move into the community. But the first generation of these drugs fell into disfavor because they often caused neurological side effects, like tremors and other involuntary movements.\n        That spurred the development of a new generation of drugs known as atypical antipsychotics, which now dominate the market and rake in some $10 billion in annual sales. The trouble is that these new drugs were approved largely on the basis of short-term clinical trials that compared them primarily with placebos, so there was little if any evidence that they were any better than many of the older drugs.\n        That gap has been filled by an 18-month clinical trial involving more than 1,400 adults around the nation. The study, sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health, measured how long patients were able to keep taking their assigned drugs before deciding to change, usually because a drug wasn't working or had intolerable side effects. Three-fourths of the patients, a shocking number, stopped taking the drug they had been given, suggesting that there is a clear need for better treatments.\n        The study found that the oldest drug, perphenazine, was as effective and caused no worse side effects than three of the newer drugs. Zyprexa, a new drug made by Eli Lilly, helped patients control symptoms slightly better than the others, but at the cost of serious side effects.\n        Doctors should find a trove of useful data in the study to help them decide which drug might be best for a particular patient. But Congress and the Bush administration ought to pay attention as well. Surely it would make sense to force manufacturers to test their drugs not just against placebos, but also against the drugs they are seeking to displace. And surely it would be cost-effective for the government to sponsor large studies comparing a slew of expensive drugs with their cheaper alternatives.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1793878,"ids":1793878,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"A grand jury that spent a year studying what to do about fraud and waste in Suffolk County school districts has offered a suggestion. It's similar to what Chief Brody told Captain Quint in ''Jaws'' the first time he saw the monster shark.\n        ''You're gonna need a bigger boat,'' he said.\n        The grand jury, convened by the Suffolk district attorney, Thomas Spota, concluded that the danger of theft, cronyism, incompetence, conflicts of interest and other forms of mismanagement and venality in the public schools was so huge that an entirely new state agency should be formed to keep districts on the straight and narrow.\n        The 345-page report released by the grand jury last week did not indict the entire system when it recommended establishing an inspector general for education. It noted that most school officials are honest and competent, and that Long Island public schools are among the best in the state.\n        But it said that school funds are such a large -- and often unguarded -- part of people's tax bills that a special effort is needed to curb the temptation for the inept and rotten few. The state comptroller's office can swoop into districts with audits, as it has been doing for every district in the state since the Roslyn scandal broke. But the report said that staff was stretched thin and lacked the resources to make sure chastened school administrators follow through on its recommendations. An independent inspector general, with the power to conduct investigations and subpoena school boards and vendors, would plug that oversight gap, issuing regular reports to the governor, local officials and -- perhaps most important -- the public.\n        A spokesman for the state comptroller, Alan Hevesi, warmed to the idea. A spokesman for the New York State School Boards Association dismissed it as redundant, akin to wearing both a belt and suspenders. But the audacity of the recent outbreaks of school thievery and shoddy management -- $11 million gone in Roslyn, $1.5 million in the William Floyd district, misspent and missing dollars elsewhere -- suggest that the current system is not working. The lapses in accountability have taken a harsh toll in public confidence, increasing taxpayers' hostility to otherwise worthy school budgets and fostering an unhealthy mix of anger and apathy.\n        For the sake of robustness and transparency in public education, the State Legislature should look closely at the recommendations coming out of Suffolk County. It should be willing to outfit the school system in belts and suspenders -- and Velcro and duct tape, too -- if that is what it takes for it to keep the public's confidence.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1758258,"ids":1758258,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"A great deal now depends on the wisdom and skills of Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the man who emerged from relative political obscurity last weekend to become Iraq's prime minister-designate. His actions over the next weeks will determine whether Iraq can reverse the drift toward sectarian civil war and build a national government. If it can, the more than 130,000 American troops now in Iraq will have a definable mission to achieve and a definable exit strategy. If not, America's predicament in Iraq will very likely only grow worse.\n        That's why Washington was right to use all the leverage it had to encourage the disastrous former prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, to withdraw his candidacy for a second term. Mr. Maliki comes from the same Shiite fundamentalist milieu as Mr. Jaafari. But there are at least some reasons to hope he can be a more effective leader.\n        His single biggest challenge will be to break the power of the Shiite party militias operating inside and outside the official security forces. These have terrorized Sunni neighborhoods and tortured Sunni detainees with impunity for much of the past year.\n        Mr. Maliki has won praise for pledging that only government forces will be allowed to carry arms. But that will do little good if he merely merges militia units into the Iraqi army and police forces as he suggested Thursday in deference to a crucial political ally, Moktada al-Sadr, who happens to head one of the deadliest Shiite militias. If that turns out to be Mr. Maliki's plan, there can be little hope of avoiding civil war.\n        It seems unlikely that the Sunni and Kurdish parties that welcomed Mr. Maliki's nomination as part of a larger power-sharing arrangement would settle for such an unsatisfactory non-solution to the country's most dangerous problem. The commitments and compromises that lubricated that deal should become clearer when Mr. Maliki unveils his new cabinet, which he now says will be done as soon as next week. It is now more than four months since Iraqis voted for a new government, and while the politicians dickered, the country has been falling apart. Mr. Maliki needs to choose both quickly and wisely.\n        It is encouraging that he has promised to keep the Defense and Interior Ministries out of the hands of sectarian politicians. He also needs to make sure that his appointees to key economic ministries, including the Oil Ministry, put competent professionals in charge of day-to-day management. And the Constitution should be adjusted to assure the central government a sufficient share of Iraq's oil revenues.\n        If all these pieces fall into place -- a long shot -- it's possible to imagine things finally turning around in Iraq. The first test will be whether Mr. Maliki starts confronting powerful allies like Mr. Sadr over the future role of the militias, and insists that the Iraqi Army and police forces take their orders only from a broad-based national government.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1821045,"ids":1821045,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"A healthy financial sector is crucial to the economic well-being of this country and to New York City in particular. And it is true that Wall Street is facing ever stiffer competition from financial markets like London's and Hong Kong's. But beware of the doomsayers who argue that American markets are in free fall and -- not incidentally -- contend that looser regulations are the only way to save them.\n        Senator Charles Schumer and Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined that chorus this week. In a new report, they warn that without changes to what they call America's ''stringent regulations and high litigation risks,'' this country's share of the lucrative finance business will decline further, at a cost of billions of dollars and thousands of jobs.\n        We certainly don't want American regulations to drive away good business. But it is first important to remember that when investors lose their shirts in huge frauds like Enron, plenty of damage is done to markets as well. And any discussion about the health of our financial industry must be as honest and open as possible. This report at times seems to cull facts to prove predetermined conclusions.\n        For example, to support its argument that the United States markets are losing ground, the report notes that over the first 10 months of 2006, American exchanges managed barely a third of the overall share of initial public offerings that they did in 2001. It strikes us as odd that a report released in late January could not include data from the previous November. In that month, the Securities and Exchange Commission registered 32 initial public offerings worth a total of $8 billion -- the highest monthly total in five years.\n        The report goes on to say that the number and cost of securities class-action settlements in this nation set an all-time high in 2005. That's hardly surprising, considering the many settlements in that year stemming from the enormous fraud at WorldCom. But what about last year? The number of securities fraud class-action suits fell 38 percent in 2006, to the lowest level in 10 years. And in May, prosecutors indicted the nation's leading class-action securities law firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad &amp; Schulman, for allegedly making secret payments to plaintiffs.\n        The report raises some valuable questions, and we agree with some of its conclusions. Loosening restrictions on work visas for talented foreigners and visitor visas for dealmakers strikes us as essential. And efforts under way to reduce the costs associated with complying with Sarbanes-Oxley regulations -- for example, by focusing audits on the riskiest parts of balance sheets -- are a valuable recalibration of the law's most onerous provisions.\n        While some common-sense changes are needed, the rights of shareholders and the stability of our markets cannot be trampled in the headlong rush for competitive advantages. United States financial markets are still the largest in the world, and Wall Street just enjoyed a year of record profits. And while we're talking about reforms, financial firms might take a look in the mirror and ask whether lower underwriting fees and smaller bonuses could also contribute to their long-term health and the health of America's financial markets.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1639627,"ids":1639627,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"A lot could go wrong with Iraq's elections on Jan. 30. But one fear that seems misplaced is that the two main Iraqi Shiite parties, which are likely to be the biggest winners, would take orders from Iran's radical Shiite ayatollahs, imposing pro-Iranian policies on Baghdad or establishing an Iraqi Shiite theocracy.\n        It's true that both of these parties, the Dawa Islamic Party and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (known as Sciri), have strong historical and personal links with Iran and its leadership. But their politics, aspirations and main constituencies are now firmly rooted in Iraq. If these parties come to power as part of a national Iraqi government, with broad support from all major population groups, their independence from Iran seems assured. That independence will be harder to preserve if the January vote splits Iraq between a self-governing but weak Shiite and Kurdish zone and a Sunni region with continuing, violent insurrection.\n        Sciri and Dawa are the dominant parties of the United Iraqi Alliance, a coalition of mainly Shiite parties running as a joint slate in the January election. Even with high voter turnout in Sunni areas, these parties are expected to do well because 60 percent of Iraqis are Shiites. With reduced Sunni participation, they are likely to do even better.\n        Both parties fell under strong Iranian influence when Saddam Hussein was ruthlessly persecuting Iraq's Shiite majority and assassinating its main political and religious leaders. Their leaders received sanctuary and money from Iran. But many of the new constituents they are courting have bitter memories of Iran, dating to the suffering of the Iran-Iraq war. And Iran's corrupt, autocratic and economically floundering clerical dictatorship is not very popular in Iran right now, let alone Iraq. Iraq's leading Shiite ayatollah, Ali al-Sistani, has repeatedly rejected the Iranian political model.\n        The real threat looming over the January elections comes from the continuing alienation of most of Iraq's Sunni minority. This extends well beyond the terrorists trying to intimidate election workers or the die-hards unable to accept majority rule. The military actions in Falluja and Mosul this fall seem to have deepened it, and it now embraces almost the entire Sunni community. The January election can begin to address this problem only if large portions of the Sunni population accept its results. Otherwise, the gravest dangers facing Iraq after Jan. 30 will not come from Iran's plotting ayatollahs, but from Iraq's own disaffected Sunnis.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1801825,"ids":1801825,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"A much-anticipated study on climate change ordered up by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has attempted to calculate the economic costs of global warming. Though necessarily conjectural, the study warns that if we continue on our current course, atmospheric temperatures could rise four degrees or so in this century, producing a hugely disruptive mix of rising sea levels and withering droughts.\n        This in turn would drain the world economy of trillions of dollars, with social and economic costs on a scale ''similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century.''\n        The study, led by Sir Nicholas Stern, former chief economist of the World Bank, says that the only way to avoid that dismal outcome is to slash worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide by investing hundreds of billions of dollars in cleaner technologies. The report has been criticized for overestimating the consequences of warming and underestimating the costs of mitigation. Still, its basic point seems unassailable: failure to act now will exact much greater penalties later on.\n        Developing and deploying the necessary technologies will require a collective global effort. But the world's leading producer of greenhouse gases, the United States, is doing scandalously little. A detailed examination by The Times's Andrew Revkin pointed out that Washington spends only $3 billion a year for all energy research and development. Of this, only a fraction -- $416 million, according to the Energy Department -- was spent last year on climate-friendly, renewable technologies like wind, solar power, cellulosic ethanol and hydrogen. By contrast, Washington spends $28 billion on medical research and $75 billion on military research.\n        The administration claims that it is in fact doing more, especially if various tax incentives for cleaner fuels like ethanol are included in the mix. Even so, in an age when people are worried not only about warming but also about the country's growing dependence on imported oil, the federal effort on alternative energy sources is pathetically small.\n        The Bush administration's lack of commitment to research might not be quite so lamentable if it had been prodding the private sector into investing in cleaner energy. Private capital is not likely to emerge in big enough quantities unless a significant cost is attached to carbon emissions -- either in the form of a carbon tax or a mandatory cap on emissions. But the administration has refused to ask Congress to impose either.\n        Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, the atmosphere has served as a free dumping ground for carbon gases. If people and industries are made to pay heavily for the privilege, they will inevitably be driven to develop cleaner fuels, cars and factories. Most of the industrialized world has accepted the need for either carbon taxes or strict regulation, and Europe has already imposed a cap on emissions from its cars and factories.\n        Mr. Bush and many in Congress remain steadfastly opposed -- still convinced, it appears, that calamity can be avoided on the cheap.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1803825,"ids":1803825,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"A new crackdown on Medicaid fraud is forcing states to follow the letter of the law to a harsh and dismal place. Under orders from the Bush administration, they are erecting unnecessary paperwork obstacles that could deny medical care to poor newborns in the crucial first weeks and months of life.\n        This development is a side effect of the nation's sour immigration debate. Since July, federal law has required that Medicaid recipients prove citizenship with passports, birth certificates or other documents. The goal is to prevent ''theft of Medicaid benefits by illegal aliens,'' according to the legislation's main sponsor, Representative Charlie Norwood, a Georgia Republican who has worked tirelessly to make life in the United States as difficult as possible for people who lack papers.\n        Illegal immigrants have no right to Medicaid, except in emergencies, which includes labor and childbirth. Perinatal care given to illegal immigrant women has routinely been extended for a year to their newborns, too, on the simple assumption that they need it and are automatically entitled to it, if they were born here. (The 14th Amendment grants citizenship to ''all persons born or naturalized in the United States.'')\n        But now, in a pointless exercise of bureaucratic obstinacy, these children will have to prove what is already self-evident. They must receive a birth certificate and have a Medicaid application approved before receiving a doctor's care. This could take days, weeks or months -- a critical time for newborns, who receive a barrage of immunizations and well-baby checkups in the first year. Some babies may get no care at all, if their noncitizen parents, fearing arrest and deportation, decide not to seek it.\n        That the children of illegal immigrants can be blessed with citizenship by accident of birth sticks in the craws of many immigration hard-liners. They include members of Congress who have voted to challenge the Constitution's citizenship clause, saying they want to stop women from sneaking over the border to have babies.\n        No doubt many pregnant women and new mothers are among the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in this country. But to demonize them all -- and to punish their babies -- is to take the immigration debate into depths of cruelty and paranoia.\n        Medicaid rules should be enforced in a way that is strict but fair and sensible. Turning more illegal immigrants away from the health care system may bolster short-term budgets and satisfy a thirst for righteousness.

A regulation that was ill-conceived and is cruelly applied is depriving an increasingly important group of health care providers of a decent living.\n        No one disputed that the health aide, Evelyn Coke, 73, of Queens, had worked overtime for no extra pay. Employed for 20 years by Long Island Care at Home, a private, for-profit agency, she was often on duty for more than eight hours a day, including many 24-hour stretches in the homes of elderly people she was assigned to care for.\n        But the Labor Department decided in 1975 to exclude home health aides from basic labor protections, like the minimum wage and time-and-a-half for overtime -- and in a 9-to-0 decision, the Supreme Court refused to do anything about it. The justices rejected Ms. Coke's argument that Congress intended to include home health employees in the labor law and to exclude only certain domestic workers, like baby sitters and companions for the elderly, who are paid by the families they work for.\n        They ruled that Congress authorized the Labor Department to write the regulation on who was to be covered under the law and that the department properly did just that. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that, given those circumstances, deferring to the department's rule ''is what the law requires.''\n        That may be. But the justices were completely silent on the question of whether denying overtime to home health employees is good policy, let alone morally justifiable. Clearly it is neither. As the population ages, home health care has become one of the nation's fastest growing occupations, with an estimated 650,000 aides currently employed -- most of them by for-profit agencies. Most of them are low income, female and minority, a recipe for exploitation. The support of federal labor laws is crucial to ensure that the aides, entrusted with the care of the most vulnerable Americans, are treated with professionalism, fairness and dignity.\n        And yet, powerful forces -- the Bush administration and the Bloomberg administration among them -- opposed Ms. Coke's claim to overtime pay. They argued that federal labor protection for home health workers would drive up the cost of Medicaid and Medicare, which cover many home health care bills. There is no doubt that the costs of these programs are rising, but refusing to pay employees fairly for the work they do is not an acceptable way to keep costs down.\n        Congress has to reform the law to include home health employees.

The team offered $280 million, but it expects at least $600 million from taxpayers to build a platform and roof for the stadium. The deal also includes $440 million from residential developers, which is contingent on rezoning that may not happen. This is all part of the fantasy that includes projections that a stadium will produce huge revenue for the city.

Unless board members can say exactly why this offer does not pass muster, they have no business making a decision that would clearly shortchange the authority.\n        The board's 14 votes include 4 controlled by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an avid backer of the Jets' bid. Another six are controlled by Gov. George Pataki, who backs the mayor. Peter Kalikow, the authority chairman, had the right idea to open up the bidding. But if there was no rush of credible offers, it was partly because developing the property depends on rezoning, which was only assured for the Jets.

It came with an arbitrary cutoff date, leaving anyone who arrived here illegally after 2004 in the cold.\n        What is urgently needed is decency, proportionality and bipartisanship to resolve this festering debate. Whenever and however the Senate revisits immigration, the bottom line must be the same: a bill that combines border security and workplace enforcement with diligent protection of workers' rights and a path to citizenship for immigrants who work for it. The alternative, the blundering and punitive status quo, is a path of misery.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1830803,"ids":1830803,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"A sleepy breakfast with New York City business and civic leaders last week turned into another lively battleground for Gov. Eliot Spitzer. As he defended his efforts to rein in Medicaid spending, representatives of the hospitals and health workers fumed in the front row, especially when he contradicted their mawkish television ads. When a reporter later mentioned how Mr. Spitzer had come out ''guns blazing'' at the health establishment, he smiled and warned, ''that wasn't guns going.''\n        Using such tactics, the governor has an impressive list of victories so far. In his first two months, he has chalked up reforms of the budget process, state ethics, and a workers' compensation system widely viewed as the worst in the country. A campaign finance reform agreement is also said to be close. These are problems that have been mired for years in Albany's political quicksand.\n        As with all such successes, there are some problems. In the case of workers' comp, for example, there are still questions about how insurance companies can be persuaded to lower the costs of compensation insurance. Mr. Spitzer has also had one notable loss, his effort to get an experienced hand to take over as the new state comptroller. The Assembly Democrats chose one of their own.\n        Mr. Spitzer's one reform to date that is troubling is last week's agreement on civil confinement legislation for dealing with sexual predators. It would be a profound shift in how the state treats those who have already served their time, and would mean locking people up for crimes they might commit in the future. The Legislature should hold new hearings to assess the wisdom of this specific proposal. The Spitzer confinement laws should not become this administration's version of the unfair Rockefeller drug laws.\n        For all of his early successes, Mr. Spitzer has not yet managed to change the way things get done in Albany. These reforms were largely worked out the old-fashioned way -- in the back rooms of the State Capitol. It makes sense that Mr. Spitzer wanted to push through some early victories, but if he plans to succeed over time, he should be doing more to bring the public into the discussion.\n        Polls show that Mr. Spitzer is enormously popular, and that the public backs his efforts to shake up state government. When the going gets rough, as it surely will, having the strong support of the public may be the most powerful weapon in his arsenal.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1848620,"ids":1848620,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"A small act of kindness by workers at a doughnut shop early last Sunday has opened a window into a horrifying story of exploitation and cruelty. The accusations highlight the serious need for New York State to crack down on the trafficking of people for sex and labor, and arose, coincidentally, just as a deal was being reached in Albany on a bill to do that.\n        According to federal prosecutors, a wealthy couple in Muttontown kept two Indonesian women in virtual slavery for years, paying them a pittance for long hours of domestic labor punctuated with sickening abuses. The couple, Varsha Mahender Sabhnani and Mahender Murlidhar Sabhnani, who run a multimillion-dollar perfume business from their home, are said to have given the women little food and forced them to sleep on mats on the floor and to hide when visitors came. Mrs. Sabhnani, according to court papers, often beat one of the women with a stick, scalded her, cut her ears with a knife and burned her with cigarettes and scalding water. In one instance, prosecutors said, she forced her victim to choke down hot chili peppers.\n        The story came to light on Mother's Day, when one of the women showed up at a Dunkin' Donuts in Syosset, bruised and disheveled, wearing only pants and a towel. Employees invited her in and offered her a jacket and coffee, then called 911 after seeing her injuries. The couple have been charged with violating a federal law against slavery.\n        The Sabhnanis are entitled to the presumption of innocence about what their lawyers say is merely ''an assault allegation.'' But the accusations against them should awaken people to a wider problem that law enforcement officials and human-rights advocacy groups have been warning about for years. New York City and its suburbs are full of desperate immigrants who suffer greatly at the hands of abusive employers. Many factors help to wrap these crimes in silence, especially the immigrants' ignorance and shame, and their fear of arrest and deportation.\n        Although there is a federal law against human trafficking for sex and labor, the Justice Department is usually forced to spend its limited resources in breaking up larger operations, like prostitution rings, and not individual cases of exploited nannies or maids. For its part, New York State has long needed an aggressive anti-trafficking law, one that contains tough penalties, helps victims to escape their tormenters and offers an array of social services once they do. A good bill sponsored last year by Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Bronx Democrat, was badly weakened in committee, and the session ended without a chance to improve it and hammer out a final bill with the Senate.\n        The news is better this year. Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Legislature reached a deal last week on an anti-trafficking bill that would turn such forms of modern slavery, particularly prostitution, into felonies and offer victims emergency housing and health care and other services from the state. Their action comes too late for the Indonesian women, identified in court papers as ''Samirah'' and ''Nona.'' But for others who are out among us, suffering mutely, the hope for justice has improved.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1666493,"ids":1666493,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"A taxpayer might ask what the pending ''emergency'' budget bill dedicated to paying for the Iraq war has to do with oil drilling in Mississippi, flood repairs in Utah and a stadium for Washington's new baseball team. The answer is that the expensive war effort provides fast and reliable, if shameful, cover for these goodies and more. Approval of the spending bill for Iraq and Afghanistan seemed so certain in the Senate that unscrupulous members of Congress larded it with favored boondoggle projects that would get booted if put to a vote on their own merits.\n        The Bush administration is the enabler, locked in the shock-and-awe stage of budgeting as it demands an additional $80 billion from a compliant Congress without including these huge expenses in the normal budget process. The underlying fiction is that the battlefield obligations are still too urgent to be detailed and defended in the annual budget. The real aim is to hurry the debate and keep the war bill out of the deficit tally during the budget process.\n        That has opened the door for Congress to impose an equally insincere rationale: if the war is still rated a budget emergency by the White House, then there's room for what one Republican leader termed ''emergency requirements here at home.'' Thus has a budgeting tool for true, distinct emergencies been reduced to a cheesy nonaccountability gimmick that helps the nation's deficit balloon with political impunity in Washington.\n        The total war and reconstruction investment in Afghanistan and Iraq is approaching $250 billion and counting -- if anyone were seriously counting. But lawmakers have been too busy inserting chunks of domestic pork into the carte blanche measure to look at the bottom line.\n        Responsible lawmakers would strip away all parochial indulgences as an insult to the men and women who are focused on the job and laying their lives on the line out on the battlefields. A few lawmakers, seeing the budget barn door swing open, at least proposed measures strengthening the death benefits for soldiers and health care for their survivors. These are worthy causes, but a more diligent Congress would air even those proposals fully.\n        Aid for the Asian tsunami victims has also been tacked onto the bill -- spending that has nothing to do with Iraq but at least is arguably urgent. What's totally indefensible is the inclusion in the House-approved measure of hard-line restrictions on immigrants' ability to gain asylum and get driver's licenses. This and a rival Senate proposal to make it easier, not harder, to hire low-wage immigrant labor are the stuff of what should be a separate, grave debate. It's time for Congress to stop throwing these rocks into the pot of emergency Iraq expenses.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1827754,"ids":1827754,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"A tempest has been brewing over a children's book that contains a word some find naughty and unsettling. The word is scrotum. It appears only a few times in the book, ''The Higher Power of Lucky,'' which is recommended for grades four to six. The scrotum in question belongs to a dog, who is bitten there by a snake.\n        On that basis, a few queasy librarians have chosen not to order the book, even though it won the prestigious Newbery Medal. The arguments pro and con are bubbling on librarians' message boards. The cons seem vastly outnumbered, though they have gotten a lot of attention. One likened the author, Susan Patron, to the shock-radio host Howard Stern. Another suggested that teachers reading the book aloud replace that word with ''a loud 'throat-clearing' noise,'' a bleep in the form of an ''ahem.''\n        All this seems like a lousy way to treat a sweet, funny book whose main character, a smart, curious 10-year-old girl named Lucky Trimble, is already wise to the power and mystery of words: ''Scrotum sounded to Lucky like something green that comes up when you have the flu and cough too much. It sounded medical and secret, but also important.''\n        Librarians all over are flinching at the furor, saying it reinforces their profession's hated archetype: Marian the Librarian, the prig in a wet blanket. (This is the perception, but it's nonsense; remember that Marian Paroo, played in the ''Music Man'' film by the lovely Shirley Jones, is the musical's only real grown-up, a complicated professional who scandalizes River City ladies with her love of bawdy books. Chaucer! Rabelais! BAL-zac!)\n        Speaking of Balzac, it seems a good time to remember that discomfort about words isn't the fault of the words or of the authors who use them. And that plain old uncynical, workmanlike common nouns lose their naughty aura through unembarrassed use. The alternative -- silent ignorance or the baby-talk slang that children acquire as surely as strep and ear infections -- seems far less healthy.\n        With every generation, a new cohort of children begins the journey from ignorance to knowledge. Librarians help those children get there. Some barely make it, and end up toting ignorance as baggage, a sniggering puerility about body parts and functions. Those are the ones who will be drawn to shock radio -- not children like the thoughtful, dauntless Lucky Trimble and those lucky enough to have read her book.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1801136,"ids":1801136,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"About the last thing the United States ought to be doing in Iraq is funneling weapons into black-market weapons bazaars, as sectarian militias arm themselves for civil war. Yet that is just what Washington may have been doing for the past several years, thanks to an inexplicable decision that standard Pentagon regulations for registering weapons transfers did not apply to the Iraq war.\n        Of more than 500,000 weapons turned over to the Iraqi Ministries of Defense and Interior since the American invasion -- including rocket-propelled grenade launchers, assault rifles, machine guns and sniper rifles -- the serial numbers of only 12,128 were properly recorded. Some 370,000 of these weapons, some of which are undoubtedly being used to kill American troops, were paid for by United States taxpayers, under the Orwellian-titled Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund.\n        This chilling information comes to us from the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, which has distinguished itself as the most vigilant agency monitoring the money spent on the Iraq conflict. The agency, led by a Republican lawyer who once worked in the Bush White House, has previously reported on the contracting lapses and failures of supervision that allowed billions of taxpayer dollars to be wasted instead of being used to rebuild Iraq.\n        The latest special inspector general's report came in response to a request from Senator John Warner, another conscientious Republican. As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner wanted to be sure that the Iraqi security ministries had the skills and resources necessary to make good use of the huge quantities of arms that Washington has been turning over to them.\n        It turns out that the Pentagon not only failed to register the weapons, but also failed to provide the spare parts, repair manuals and maintenance technicians needed to keep them in working order. The agency found that Iraqi security forces are still heavily dependent on Washington's support for the most basic military functions. And with America planning to scale back much of that support over the next year, it is far from clear whether Baghdad is preparing to pick up the slack.\n        Separately, the inspector general's office also found insecurity so rampant in six Iraqi provinces -- five of them in the predominantly Shiite south -- that America's joint military and civil reconstruction teams could not operate there effectively.\n        These findings go a long way toward explaining why Iraq appears to be ever more violent, with no clear plans yet coming from Baghdad or Washington that seem likely to restore a semblance of order.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":5,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1852954,"ids":1852954,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Absolutely the last thing Iraq needs right now is to have thousands of Turkish troops pour across the border into the country's one relatively peaceful region -- the Kurdish-administered northeast. Turkey's government needs to know that it will reap nothing but disaster if that happens.\n        A huge military buildup is already under way on the Turkish side of the border, and Ankara has been issuing a flurry of angry charges that the Iraqi Kurds are providing sanctuary to murderous anti-Turkish guerrillas.\n        The Bush administration has rightly stepped up its warnings to Turkey not to attack. A Turkish invasion would not only embarrass the United States, which numbers the Kurds among its few allies in Iraq. It would add a whole new and even more dangerous dimension to the mess in Iraq.\n        It would infuriate Arabs, who would resent any Turkish return to areas once ruled by the Ottoman Empire. It would finish off any remaining hope of Turkey joining the European Union. And it would put a huge strain on Turkey's fragile democratic politics. In short, it would be a disaster.\n        Turkey does have a real problem. Guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or the P.K.K., have been striking into Turkey from their bases in Iraqi Kurdistan with growing impunity and effect, using plastic explosives, mines and arms that are readily accessible in Iraq.\n        These strikes have roused powerful passions in Turkey, stoked by generals eager to regain their primacy over the civilian government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which military leaders loathe for its roots in Islamic politics. So far, Turkish forces have occasionally chased P.K.K. rebels into Iraq, but they have always withdrawn.\n        Turkey's feud with the P.K.K. is inextricably tied to other conflicts and rivalries inside Iraq. The most directly relevant is the tug of war between the Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens over the oil-rich region of Kirkuk. Ankara's fear of fears is that a quasi-independent, Kurdish statelet on its borders could embolden Turkey's 15 million-strong Kurdish minority to demand autonomy or independence.\n        Reining in the Turkish Army will take more than the warnings already issued by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Turkey's leaders must understand that a major military operation in Iraq could touch off a series of regional wars and realignments that would harm Turkey far more than anything the P.K.K. could possibly cook up.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1649239,"ids":1649239,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Add to the painful postmortems of 9\/11 this week's disclosure that federal aviation officials were more lulled than alarmed by a steady stream of intelligence warnings about Osama bin Laden in the months before the terrorist attacks. As with numerous other intelligence failures uncovered by the Sept. 11 commission, the warnings -- dozens of them -- were not deemed specific enough to provide adequate defenses at the nation's airports, according to Federal Aviation Administration officials. In 105 intelligence reports received during the five months preceding the attacks, Osama bin Laden or Al Qaeda were mentioned 52 times, according to the commission, which faulted the F.A.A. for not doing enough to heighten security.\n        These latest details were contained in a chapter of the commission's final report that was withheld by the Bush administration for months, heavily censored and then released to the public only after Eric Lichtblau printed details in The Times. They point to the cornucopia of intelligence that was flowing through federal bureaucracies without benefit of an authoritative analysis to pinpoint the looming threat. The F.A.A. got the reports through a 24-hour liaison it maintained with the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Department. It's not clear from this latest report, or at least the portion the White House thought fit for public consumption, whether those agencies passed on the warnings to the White House.\n        It is clear that none of those agencies connected the dots in time. That's a familiar, grim lesson, but, sadly, Americans should not conclude that it has been taken to heart. The problem of ''stovepiping'' -- rival intelligence gathering conducted without effective coordination by the 15 national spy agencies -- still awaits a firm hand to bring order from bureaucratic chaos. If anything, fresh mischief is afoot as the Pentagon is lately reported to have created specialized overseas espionage teams, thereby angering the C.I.A., while the F.B.I. is reported to be recruiting foreigners as overseas spies, further raising C.I.A. hackles.\n        Still, no one's in charge. The newly created post of national intelligence director is supposed to rein in these agency rivalries. But the job remains vacant eight weeks after President Bush signed the intelligence overhaul law that he reluctantly accepted after the 9\/11 commission pressed Congress for reform. One prime candidate, Robert Gates, a former director of central intelligence, has already declined consideration for the job -- which has been so whittled down by back-room deals in Congress that it strikes many Washington insiders as thankless. As now configured, it involves refereeing disputes between the Pentagon and civilian spy agencies, minus the full powers the director needs to hire and fire and to control the disparate agencies.\n        For all his earlier reluctance, it will take President Bush to step up and embrace the intelligence reform law with enough conviction to attract a top-flight director willing to serve the nation and take on Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. His choice will then need the backing of the president's moral and political authority. Otherwise, the nation's intelligence shield threatens to slip even further.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1690317,"ids":1690317,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Advocates for the homeless and New York City officials have been battling in court for 25 years -- a figure that invariably calls up references to ''Bleak House,'' the Charles Dickens novel about lives and hopes destroyed by an endless court fight. In the case of the city's shelter system, however, all that litigation has actually borne fruit. Although far from idyllic, things are much, much better than a quarter-century ago. Both the advocates and the Bloomberg administration deserve a great deal of credit.\n        But enough is enough.\n        Earlier this year, City Hall and advocates for the homeless were close to a settlement that would have ended court oversight of the system. But now both sides have retreated to their foxholes. It's time to get back to business. Ending court oversight is long overdue.\n        Mayor Michael Bloomberg has demonstrated an impressive commitment to improving the shelter system, particularly the intake process. Simply getting into a city shelter was once a dirty and dangerous process: families with small children and homeless adults were thrown together in cramped, unsanitary conditions, sometimes for days on end. The new screening process is safer, faster and far more humane.\n        The city now has the data to oversee the shelter system -- officials know far more than they once did about who is being served and where the beds are. Nonprofit groups work with landlords and families at risk to keep people from becoming homeless in the first place. Record numbers of families who have become homeless have been moved into permanent housing. This was accomplished by holding shelter providers more closely accountable for managing the cases of those needing housing.\n        The city has also held the shelter residents accountable for obeying the rules that require them to take affirmative steps toward self-sufficiency. The advocates challenged this initiative because it gave shelters the right to evict violators, and the advocates lost in the state's highest court. As is their right under the law, they continue to challenge individual eviction cases brought by the city against a handful of single residents of adult shelters who have caused problems.\n        The advocates argue that some of the shelter residents in question suffer mental illnesses and should not be held accountable for their actions. The city clearly needs to be careful in the eviction process. But the advocates need to read the writing on the wall. From now on, homeless New Yorkers will be pushed to take more responsibility for reclaiming their lives, and that is not at all a bad thing.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1704104,"ids":1704104,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Afghanistan and Iraq were both invaded by United States-led forces, which overthrew outlaw regimes. Both have new constitutions, guided by the same American diplomat. Both have foreign armies of significant size on their sovereign soil. But Iraq is careering toward civil war, while Afghanistan has just completed an encouragingly inclusive parliamentary election. Iraq cannot even begin to talk about defending itself without American troops. Afghanistan is already saying it's time for the United States to cease major military operations on its territory.\n        While no one should underestimate Afghanistan's serious problems, including a resurgent Taliban, a shattered infrastructure and rampant drug trafficking, no one can fail to see the many signs of progress there, while only the most die-hard Bush administration spinners pretend to see any significant and lasting gains in Iraq. It is important to try to understand why this is happening.\n        One reason, surely, is that Afghanistan, for all of its ethnic diversity and political turbulence, has a long continuous history as a single nation. International intervention can, with skill and luck, revive a battered and prostrate nation. But it cannot easily create one where the population has no real history of, or desire for, willing coexistence and cooperation.\n        Another is that the full backing and support from the United Nations for Afghanistan's transformation and recovery encouraged the provision of international financial support and expertise and, even more important, endowed the new government with crucial international legitimacy. That imposed a useful measure of self-restraint on neighboring countries like Pakistan and Russia, which had long meddled in Afghan affairs with highly destructive consequences.\n        Afghanistan has also benefited from the skilled and effective leadership provided by President Hamid Karzai, a surprisingly adept domestic politician and international diplomat. Mr. Karzai has not hesitated to criticize the United States and Pakistan when necessary. He has also struck an acceptable balance between two powerful forces. One is the political need to reach out to other ethnic groups and to former Taliban members who are willing to play by the new rules of peaceful politics. The other is the moral and strategic necessity of gradually marginalizing the most notorious warlords and pressuring all of them to disarm their unacceptable private militias.\n        The world has a chance to help Afghanistan build on this hopeful start. In particular, the international community needs to put more pressure on President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan to end Taliban activities, especially recruiting, on Pakistani soil. And NATO countries must send the additional troops that are badly needed to ensure enough security throughout Afghanistan to rebuild roads, reservoirs and power plants, and to attract private investment.\n        The challenges facing Afghanistan are enormous, but with luck and continued international cooperation, this is one American-led intervention that could wind up actually making people's lives better.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1713042,"ids":1713042,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Afghanistan is demonstrating that even one of the world's poorest and least secure countries can conduct credible elections.

Now he has been joined by an elected parliament, in many ways an even more difficult feat because district campaigns had to be waged in even the least secure areas.\n        The nearly complete voting results, announced last weekend, show a mixed picture. A large number of seats were captured by some of the country's most fearsome warlords or their followers, including four former Taliban commanders, several notorious Islamist mujahedeen leaders and a number of drug lords. Another sizable chunk went to religious fundamentalists. Taken together, these groups will constitute almost half of the new parliament, although most candidates ran as individuals, not as part of national party slates, and there is no reason to think that these diverse elements will promote a common policy agenda.\n        But many voters also looked to a different, more hopeful kind of future. Women did remarkably well as candidates, winning 68 of the parliament's 249 seats. And the men who were elected include significant numbers of political independents and educated professionals.\n        Of course, holding elections is only one component of successful nation-building. At least as important is the challenge of reviving the war-shattered economy and generating enough development to reduce desperate poverty, resettle returning refugees and provide the alternative jobs that will lure people away from private militias or opium farms. Afghanistan cannot afford to do these things itself. But relatively modest amounts of additional American assistance could go a long way.\n        The less than $1 billion that the Bush administration is seeking for Afghan civil development next year is too little to accomplish even the most urgently needed tasks. That amount should be more than doubled, and increased still further as more of the country becomes secure and open to agriculture and rural development. Most of the additional aid needs to go into constructing an adequate rural road network, providing electric power to the 94 percent of Afghans still without it and giving farmers the seasonal credit, technical assistance and market outlets needed to break the economic grip of the opium traffickers and to promote alternative crops and livelihoods. Some should also be directed into strengthening local government.\n        Americans can be proud of their role in helping to drive the tyrannical and hateful Taliban from power and giving Afghans the chance to make a new democratic start.

These days, it is not going well. One of the most important reasons for that is the ambivalence of Pakistan, the nation that originally helped create, nurture and train the Taliban. Even now, Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, seems to invest far more energy in explaining his government's tolerance of Taliban activities than he does in trying to shut them down.\n        General Musharraf has provided logistical help to Pentagon operations and cooperation to American law enforcement agencies trying to track down Al Qaeda leaders. But his aid has been frustratingly selective. He has been an intermittent collaborator in the fight against international terrorism rather than a fully committed ally. Washington has been understandably reluctant to push him for more consistency, not wanting to risk losing the help he does offer.\n        Pakistan's passive enabling of the Taliban, however, is too important and dangerous for Washington to overlook. The current Taliban offensive is killing American soldiers -- at least 38 have died in action so far this year, as well as hundreds of Afghans. It also endangers next month's parliamentary elections.\n        Successful elections are crucial to extending the geographical reach of Afghanistan's new national institutions. And they can provide needed political accountability for President Hamid Karzai, who now rules without an elected Parliament. Afghanistan will be a functioning democracy only when citizens can take their grievances against the central government to elected local representatives instead of to armed local warlords. Those grievances are real. Some governors and police chiefs Mr. Karzai has appointed are thuggish and corrupt. Antidrug efforts go after poor farmers while traffickers thrive. Alternative development lags. A lack of judges stymies the rule of law.\n        Earlier this year, there were reasons to be hopeful about Afghanistan's future. The presidential election had gone off remarkably smoothly, and the absence of major attacks on polling places suggested that Pakistan was at last responding to Washington's pleas to rein in the Taliban. Mr. Karzai had begun easing notorious warlords out of cabinet ministries and provincial governorships. More money was being directed at antinarcotics efforts.\n        But once the snows began to melt this March, Taliban fighters started showing up in greater numbers and with suspiciously sophisticated gear in regions of Afghanistan that border Pakistan. Afghan military and intelligence officers are convinced that they are coming from Pakistani training camps.\n        General Musharraf says that he has sent tens of thousands of troops to police border areas. Yet well-supplied Taliban fighters keep showing up to battle American troops in Afghanistan. He insists that the training camps are still shut down and that he is committed to thwarting the Taliban, but says he must proceed cautiously so he doesn't inflame militant groups in Pakistan. That would be more persuasive had the general not spent close to six years marginalizing mainstream parties and cutting deals with Islamic extremists to reinforce his rule.\n        When questioned about why he has repeatedly violated his promises to restore civilian democracy, General Musharraf argues that he must retain power because Pakistan needs his strong and effective hand.

According to an article in yesterday's Times, investigators for the Pentagon and the State Department found that the training program's managers did not even know how many police officers were serving, while thousands of trucks and other American-purchased police equipment have simply disappeared.\n        The failure to provide local security -- or even a semblance of impartial justice -- helps explain why so many Afghans have lost confidence in the pro-Western government of President Hamid Karzai, and why a growing number are again turning to the Taliban for protection. The failure to stand up an effective police force also helps explain why opium cultivation rose by nearly 60 percent this year.\n        Creating even the most basic government institutions was always going to be difficult in a country as poor as Afghanistan. According to one expert, 70 percent or more of the recruits in the police training program are illiterate -- not surprising in a country with a male literacy rate of only 43 percent. But the State Department and Pentagon compounded these problems, handing off the bulk of the police training work to an expensive private contractor and then failing to vigilantly monitor the program.

Mr. Karzai needs to do a lot more to curb the corruption that is rife among his political appointees. President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan needs to do a lot more to stanch the torrent of Taliban fighters crossing his border into Afghanistan. NATO members need to send more troops to Afghanistan -- with far fewer restrictions on how they fight.\n        As for fixing the police training program, there is little hope of that without also reforming the Afghan Ministry of Interior, which oversees the police, and is mired in both incompetence and corruption. Washington has sent some advisers to help clean up the ministry, but the effort is moving far too slowly. And the United States and its allies need to send a lot more police advisers to walk the beat with the newly graduated recruits, who get just a few months of classroom training. That is standard practice for training effective police forces, but it has not been tried in Afghanistan.\n        Mr. Bush's decision to rush off to invade Iraq meant that Afghanistan would be shortchanged when it came to resources and to policy makers' priority lists. The cost of that inattention can be seen in the failing Afghan police force. It can also be seen in the Taliban's growing strength, the mounting death toll of Afghan civilians and NATO troops, and the unraveling of the Karzai government. So much for winning the good war.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1837730,"ids":1837730,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"After Gov. Eliot Spitzer, a self-declared ''steamroller,'' negotiated his first state budget last weekend, legislators were gleeful. A few even boasted publicly that for all of Mr. Spitzer's brash talk, he had been easily flattened by the old hands in Albany.\n        Such celebrations should be short-lived. Mr. Spitzer made some compromises, but in exchange he won important and fundamental changes in the way the state operates. New Yorkers who yearn for a government that works more for its citizens than for the stale, political subculture in Albany should soon be able to recognize that Mr. Spitzer has gotten off to a good start.\n        The most regrettable loss for reform was the secretive way this $121 billion budget was negotiated. Mr. Spitzer came to Albany promising to destroy its backroom culture, yet when Sunday's deadline loomed, he succumbed to horse-trading state assets behind closed doors. He should plan on creating New York's next budget in the sunlight with more of the key negotiating sessions open to the public.\n        Still, there were important signs of progress. This year's budget finally establishes a new formula for school financing that tries to disburse state dollars based on need rather than political clout. Clout still mattered: Long Island senators managed to extract millions of dollars in extra financing for their affluent suburban school districts. But by fixing the underlying formula -- and making clear which legislators were intent on grabbing an unfair share -- Mr. Spitzer laid the groundwork for more equitable spending in coming years. He has also made it easy to pick out legislators -- four Republican senators from New York City come immediately to mind -- who are so docile that they are willing to side with their leaders, even when it means less money for needy schools in their own districts.\n        Mr. Spitzer also scored important victories on health care; mainly, the budget expands health insurance in ways that could make New York a leader in the nation. At the same time, this is the first budget in years that significantly reins in Medicaid costs. Mr. Spitzer accomplished this by being willing to endure a surge of union-sponsored attack ads. He insisted on requiring health care interests to battle for state financing along with everybody else. His approach is a welcome change from Gov. George Pataki's policy of literally giving the health care workers' union a seat at secret budget negotiations.\n        There is still more in the budget to be pleased about. There are tax cuts targeted to the middle class. Business tax loopholes will be closed, with some of the savings used to start lowering overall business taxes. There is a new whistleblower statute to help curb Medicaid fraud, and money for embryonic stem cell research -- two items Republicans have resisted for years.\n        Mr. Spitzer did not get everything he wanted, and this 2,000-page budget may yet hold unpleasant surprises. But over all, the governor's first budget offers some assurance to New Yorkers that he is aiming this huge battleship in the right direction.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1715949,"ids":1715949,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"After President Bush's disastrous visit to Latin America, it's unnerving to realize that his presidency still has more than three years to run. An administration with no agenda and no competence would be hard enough to live with on the domestic front. But the rest of the world simply can't afford an American government this bad for that long.\n        In Argentina, Mr. Bush, who prides himself on his ability to relate to world leaders face to face, could barely summon the energy to chat with the 33 other leaders there, almost all of whom would be considered friendly to the United States under normal circumstances. He and his delegation failed to get even a minimally face-saving outcome at the collapsed trade talks and allowed a loudmouthed opportunist like the president of Venezuela to steal the show.\n        It's amazing to remember that when Mr. Bush first ran for president, he bragged about his understanding of Latin America, his ability to speak Spanish and his friendship with Mexico. But he also made fun of Al Gore for believing that nation-building was a job for the United States military.\n        The White House is in an uproar over the future of Karl Rove, the president's political adviser, and spinning off rumors that some top cabinet members may be asked to walk the plank. Mr. Bush could certainly afford to replace some of his top advisers. But the central problem is not Karl Rove or Treasury Secretary John Snow or even Donald Rumsfeld, the defense secretary. It is President Bush himself.\n        Second terms may be difficult, but the chief executive still has the power to shape what happens. Ronald Reagan managed to turn his messy second term around and deliver -- in great part through his own powers of leadership -- a historic series of agreements with Mikhail Gorbachev that led to the peaceful dismantling of the Soviet empire. Mr. Bush has never demonstrated the capacity for such a comeback. Nevertheless, every American has a stake in hoping that he can surprise us.\n        The place to begin is with Dick Cheney, the dark force behind many of the administration's most disastrous policies, like the Iraq invasion and the stubborn resistance to energy conservation. Right now, the vice president is devoting himself to beating back Congressional legislation that would prohibit the torture of prisoners. This is truly a remarkable set of priorities: his former chief aide was indicted, Mr. Cheney's back is against the wall, and he's declared war on the Geneva Conventions.\n        Mr. Bush cannot fire Mr. Cheney, but he could do what other presidents have done to vice presidents: keep him too busy attending funerals and acting as the chairman of studies to do more harm. Mr. Bush would still have to turn his administration around, but it would at least send a signal to the nation and the world that he was in charge, and the next three years might not be as dreadful as they threaten to be right now.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1789048,"ids":1789048,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"After a Kurdish group claimed responsibility for a series of recent bombings in Turkey that killed three civilians and injured many others, the United States appointed a retired Air Force general and former NATO commander, Joseph Ralston, to work with Turkish authorities. General Ralston will be responsible for coordinating American antiterrorist efforts with Iraq and Turkey, both of which have sizable Kurdish minorities -- and minorities within those minorities who have resorted to terror.\n        The Turkish foreign ministry hailed the appointment as a ''new opportunity'' for cooperation between the United States and Turkey.\n        The United States would be wise to create many more and varied opportunities to engage with Turkey, a longtime ally, and a uniquely important one. Turkey is a predominantly Muslim, secular democracy, situated between Europe and the Middle East. After years of trying to make amends for having suppressed its Kurdish population, often brutally, Turkey has seen violence resume of late. The United States needs to frankly acknowledge that instability in Iraq, on Turkey's southeast border, has fomented instability in Turkey. That morally obligates the United States to help with corrective action.\n        Equally important, a renewed focus on Turkey is in the United States' self interest. Last week, the nonprofit German Marshall Fund of the United States released the results of its annual survey of public opinion in the United States and 12 countries in Europe, including Turkey. The survey's most striking finding is the degree to which Turks now question their ties to the United States and Europe, and have warmed to Iran, their neighbor to the east.\n        The discontent appears anchored in Turks' overwhelming disapproval of President Bush's handling of international affairs and growing disapproval of European Union leadership. Both are manifest in waning Turkish support for the institutions that have bound Turkey to the West. Though Turkey has been a staunch NATO member since 1952, only 44 percent of Turks in this year's survey agreed that NATO was essential for Turkey's security, versus 52 percent in 2005. Even though Turkey opened official membership talks with the European Union last year -- after strenuous efforts to meet the union's criteria -- only 54 percent of Turks now view membership as a good thing, versus 73 percent in 2004.\n        As Turks see it, their support over decades for the West and for democracy has been rewarded with severe regional tension brought on by the United States, and by a cold shoulder, particularly from France and Austria, ever since Turkey qualified for European Union accession talks.\n        The appointment of General Ralston may help the United States to re-engage with Turkey, though ending Kurdish violence and tensions requires mainly political solutions. The United States can also help to keep Turkey's aspiration to join the European Union on track, by advocating more openly for resolution of the division of Cyprus between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.\n        The United States must not ever take Turkey for granted.","adu_anecdote":14,"adu_other":5,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1835091,"ids":1835091,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"After a decade of small-bore measures and frustrating stalemates, it looks as if Congress may be ready to require that insurance coverage for mental illness and substance abuse be provided on the same terms as coverage for physical ailments. So-called parity legislation would be a boon to the millions of Americans who suffer from mental illness or addiction and find it hard to afford treatment. It should also reduce the high productivity losses from depressed or stressed workers.\n        The Senate and the House should move aggressively to pass this much-needed legislation and send it to President Bush for his signature.\n        Neither the Senate nor the House versions of the bill would require employers or health plans to cover mental illness. But if they do provide such coverage, the financial terms and treatment limits would have to be the same as they are for medical and surgical benefits. No longer could health plans limit mental patients to fewer days in the hospital or fewer outpatient visits. Nor could they make mental patients pay higher deductibles, co-payments or other out-of-pocket charges than other patients.\n        The most striking development this year is the broad consensus behind the Senate bill, the fruit of extended negotiations with employer groups and insurance plans that have fought such measures in the past, lest their costs be driven up. The bill is backed by Senators Ted Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico -- both long-time champions of equal treatment for mental health -- whose staff members worked out the compromise. The final product may not be perfect, but it gives mental health advocates much of what they want.\n        The House bill, whose chief sponsor is Representative Patrick Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island and the senator's son, looks stronger in some respects. It would require that any plan that covered mental health provide coverage for, at a minimum, the same wide range of mental and addiction disorders that are currently covered by the health plan with the largest enrollment of federal employees. The Senate bill does not say what conditions must be covered, and focuses simply on ensuring equal cost-sharing and treatment limits. That is based on a tactical judgment that the business community would fight broad coverage requirements.\n        Given that President Bush has endorsed the idea of mental health parity, and that both houses seem poised to enact it, the prospects look good for ending the long stalemate. But the House will need to be careful not to overreach and upset the carefully built compromise that has finally brought recalcitrant insurers and employers to the side of equal treatment for mental health and addiction.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1675402,"ids":1675402,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"After a five-year ban, the president of the Palestinian Authority will finally be welcomed at the White House. After arriving Tuesday night in his first visit as the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas met yesterday with Congressional members. Today, Mr. Abbas has meetings set first with leaders of Jewish organizations, one of three planned meetings with religious groups, and then at the White House with President Bush.\n        This is all as it should be. Mr. Abbas is arguably the Arab world's most democratically elected leader and, in just five months, has shown himself to be a far more honest, effective and reliable representative of the Palestinian people than Yasir Arafat, who last visited the White House when Bill Clinton was president. Mr. Bush, whose refusal to deal with Mr. Arafat appears to have earned him the everlasting devotion of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, clearly must think Mr. Abbas is doing something right.\n        In many ways, he is. Unlike his predecessor, he has certainly said many of the right things: that Palestinian attacks against the Israelis hurt the Palestinian cause; that Hamas and other militant groups should stop lobbing rockets from Gaza into Israel; that Palestinians must be pragmatic about what it will take to get a state. Mr. Abbas has even done things like firing security chiefs after attacks on Israeli targets.\n        Obviously, Israel wants more, and Israeli officials are right when they say that Mr. Abbas must actually dismantle factories in Gaza where they say militants are using the cease-fire to build rockets to lob at Israel. More rockets are the last thing either Israelis or Palestinians need, and if Hamas and other militant groups are indeed resting up and restocking their ammunition to launch more attacks, then Mr. Abbas would do well to crack down now.\n        But these are precious moments that should not be lost by falling back on tired old rhetoric and useless bloodshed. Mr. Sharon wants Mr. Bush to pressure Mr. Abbas to crack down on Hamas, and Mr. Bush should do so. But Israel must also understand that now is the time for courageous leadership, and that here is a brief window for peace that could close easily. Israeli officials haven't exactly been blameless themselves; Mr. Sharon is continuing his ill-advised plan to build new houses in the settlement of Maale Adumim, a move certain to further inflame tensions.\n        Israel's upcoming withdrawal from the Gaza Strip -- now scheduled for August -- is key. Handled properly, the Gaza withdrawal could re-energize prospects for peace. But if it degenerates into a violent showdown between settlers and the Israeli Army, with Hamas unhelpfully throwing rockets at settlers on their way out of Gaza, any chance of returning to the road map will be lost.\n        Mr. Bush's challenge today is to lean hard on Mr. Abbas to do all he can to keep a lid on Hamas. But while he's pressuring Mr. Abbas, Mr. Bush would also do well to send a message to his good friend Mr. Sharon. The road to peace, after all, is a two-way street.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1651965,"ids":1651965,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"After a second consecutive presidential election marred by significant flaws in the mechanics of voting, it's time for Congress to take a hard look at fixing the system. Two Senate bills aim to do that. A Republican-sponsored bill is narrowly tailored around making electronic voting more reliable. A more ambitious bill, sponsored by the Democrats, would take on a broad array of problems, from long lines at the polls to odious maneuvers aimed at keeping people from voting. Both bills would greatly improve the functioning of American democracy.\n        The Republican bill, introduced by Senator John Ensign of Nevada, would focus on the most critical weakness in the system by requiring that electronic voting machines produce voter-verifiable paper records of the votes cast. The paper records would take precedence when there were inconsistencies.\n        Mr. Ensign's bill does not go as far as another paper-trail bill that has been introduced in the House by Representative Rush Holt, a New Jersey Democrat. That bill is preferable because it includes other safeguards, like requiring an audit of some paper records as a spot-check for the electronic totals. Still, Mr. Ensign's bill would be a good step, and its Republican sponsorship and narrow focus could give it real momentum in this Congress.\n        The Democratic Senate bill, introduced last week by Senators Hillary Clinton, Barbara Boxer, John Kerry and Frank Lautenberg, is now the gold standard for election reform. It would require not only paper records, but recounts in 2 percent of all polling places or precincts, and restrictions on political activity by voting machine manufacturers.\n        The bill would also take on lines at the polls -- which stretched up to 10 hours this year -- by requiring standards for the minimum number of voting machines per precinct. It would limit the states' ability to throw out voter registration forms and provisional ballots on technicalities, and prevent them from using onerous identification requirements to turn away eligible voters. And it would strike a blow against vote suppression by outlawing the use of deception -- like fliers giving the wrong date for a election -- to keep people from voting.\n        Some important big-picture reforms would also be made by that Democratic Senate bill. It would make Election Day a holiday, freeing up people to vote and serve as poll workers, and it would require states to allow early voting. It would bar chief election officials, including secretaries of state, from engaging in partisan politics. And it would require states to restore the vote to felons who have paid their debts to society; many of them are now barred from voting.\n        Election reform should not be a partisan issue. No member of Congress should be satisfied with a system in which voters are forced to wait in line for hours or to vote on unreliable machines. Americans from across the political spectrum were moved to see Iraqi voters going to the polls last month. Congress should take that idealism and direct it toward making our own election system the best it can be.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1660983,"ids":1660983,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"After decades of sporadic wrangling, Congress may finally be ready to address the asbestos disease crisis that is clogging the courts and bankrupting companies while leaving gravely ill Americans without compensation. When the Senate returns from the Easter break, reaching a bipartisan agreement on a fair and adequately financed system for covering asbestos claims is a pressing chore.\n        This mess is a tragic legacy of widespread use of the carcinogenic material over many years in products like ceiling tiles and insulation, aprons and blankets. An estimated 10,000 people die each year from asbestos-related diseases, and many thousands more develop nonfatal illnesses.\n        Because it can take up to 30 years for those exposed to asbestos to get sick, it is too early to know the exact toll. But with hundreds of thousands of claims pending, it is clear that civil courts cannot handle the load, much less ensure that awards to people who were exposed but are still healthy do not deplete resources for those who are already ill.\n        Senator Arlen Specter, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is finishing a bill that would move the asbestos problem out of the courts and process claims according to pre-established medical criteria under an expedited no-fault system -- along the lines of workers' compensation. This promising measure was hammered out in close collaboration with Senator Patrick Leahy, the committee's senior Democrat, and other senators, and in dozens of negotiating sessions with representatives of business, insurers, labor and trial lawyers.\n        It would use contributions from manufacturers and insurers to create a $140 billion trust fund that would pay awards to those who are actually sick. Workers exposed to asbestos but not yet ill would receive free medical screenings every three years. All pending cases, except those that have gone to verdict or have signed settlements, would be shifted to the fund. If the money ran out, victims could immediately go back to court. A similar effort collapsed last year when Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader, tried to push through a one-sided version at the end of the session that significantly reduced the trust fund and required victims to wait a substantial time before going to court if the money ran out.\n        The trust fund must not only have adequate overall funding, but the bulk of the money must also be available up front when existing claims pour in. Mr. Specter is expected to present his finished proposal, resolving this and other thorny details, when the Senate returns. Much now depends on his fortitude in standing up to pressure from within his own party to water down the plan in ways that would make it unfair to victims. That includes possible pressure from the White House, which has targeted asbestos litigation as part of its drive for a business-friendly remake of the nation's civil justice system.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1726295,"ids":1726295,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"After five years, we're used to President Bush throwing up false choices to defend his policies. Americans were told, after all, that there was a choice between invading Iraq and risking a terrorist nuclear attack. So it was not a surprise that Mr. Bush's Oval Office speech Sunday night and his news conference yesterday were thick with Orwellian constructions: the policy debate on Iraq is between those who support Mr. Bush and those who want to pull out right now, today; fighting terrorists in Iraq means we're not fighting them here.\n        But none of these phony choices were as absurd as the one Mr. Bush posed to justify his secret program of spying on Americans: save lives or follow the law.\n        Mr. Bush said he thwarted terrorist plots by allowing the National Security Agency to monitor Americans' international communications without a warrant. We don't know if that is true because the administration reverts to top-secret mode when pressed for details. But we can reach a conclusion about Mr. Bush's assertion that obeying a 27-year-old law prevents swift and decisive action in a high-tech era. It's a myth.\n        The 1978 law that regulates spying on Americans (remember Richard Nixon's enemies lists?) does require a warrant to conduct that sort of surveillance. It also created a special court that is capable of responding within hours to warrant requests. If that is not fast enough, the attorney general may authorize wiretaps and then seek a warrant within 72 hours.\n        Mr. Bush and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales offered a whole bag of logical pretzels yesterday to justify flouting this law. Most bizarre was the assertion that Congress authorized the surveillance of American citizens when it approved the use of ''all necessary and appropriate force'' by the United States military to punish those responsible for the 9\/11 attacks or who aided or harbored the terrorists. This came as a surprise to lawmakers, who thought they were voting for the invasion of Afghanistan and the capture of Osama bin Laden.\n        This administration has a long record of expanding presidential powers in dangerous ways; the indefinite detention of ''unlawful enemy combatants'' comes to mind. So assurances that surveillance targets are carefully selected with reasonable cause don't comfort. In a democracy ruled by laws, investigators identify suspects and prosecutors obtain warrants for searches by showing reasonable cause to a judge, who decides if legal tests were met.\n        Chillingly, this is not the only time we've heard of this administration using terrorism as an excuse to spy on Americans. NBC News recently discovered a Pentagon database of 1,500 ''suspicious incidents'' that included a Quaker meeting to plan an antiwar rally. And Eric Lichtblau writes in today's Times that F.B.I. counterterrorism squads have conducted numerous surveillance operations since Sept. 11, 2001, on groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Greenpeace and the Catholic Workers group.\n        Mr. Bush says Congress gave him the power to spy on Americans.

That said, specific policies and the money to fund them must be produced, and real results will depend on Mr. Bloomberg using his persuasive powers to attack poverty much as he has done on less sweeping problems like smoking and the proliferation of handguns.\n        Federal standards place the poverty line at $15,735 for a family of three, one parent and two children, but that does not take into account the extremely high cost of living in places like New York. About 19 percent of New Yorkers -- 1.5 million people -- are officially poor; about the same number live at poverty's edge.\n        Mr. Bloomberg and his panel have targeted the segments of the poor population where they believe they can most easily have a measurable impact: children under the age of 5, adults 18 to 24 years old and the working poor -- about 700,000 people. If the assistance works, and the economic health of these groups improves, resources can then be redirected to help others who are not included in the commission's target group, like the elderly and unemployed.\n        The program aims to be a kind of Marshall Plan for some of the poor, and it could make the city a leader in this kind of ambitious effort.\n        The commission -- headed by Richard Parsons, the chairman of Time Warner, and Geoffrey Canada, a highly regarded pioneer of antipoverty programs -- seems to have searched everywhere for ideas that work. Incentive payments of $50 to $1,500, which would reward everything from good performance on tests to getting a sick child to a doctor, have been used with success in Turkey and in Mexico City. They also reflect the mayor's affinity for solving public problems with corporate-style tools.\n        The commission rightly targeted affordable day care, a lifeline for working parents. But tax credits and the paperwork required to claim them could be onerous; a direct refund along the lines of the city's property tax rebate would be less cumbersome. Helping young people finish degrees and obtain career training is another worthy idea. But the hard part will be ensuring that there are good jobs at the end of the line -- jobs that offer real avenues for the middle class.\n        That is an area where the mayor could really have an impact. He could speak out not only here but nationally for a raise in the paltry federal minimum wage, and he could convene business leaders to explore ways to raise wages and improve benefits for the lowest-paid employees. Right now, about one-quarter of the jobs in the city pay poverty wages, often without health care or other benefits. That all but guarantees a dead end for the poor, no matter how hard they work.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1853537,"ids":1853537,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"After starting with high hopes, a veto-proof Democratic majority and a big budget surplus six months ago, the legislative session staggered to a close Wednesday without a budget agreement and few of its big goals accomplished.\n        Democrats' aims of raising taxes and making the income tax more progressive to finance universal health care never came close to the finish line. The Democrats, for their part, dismissed much of Gov. M. Jodi Rell's agenda: education and health care proposals, property tax cuts and proposed caps on property tax increases. Ms. Rell kept the Democrats off balance with different ideas for a while, but she could never gain traction on her initiatives.\n        The result was deadlock; this session will be remembered as much for what the General Assembly did not pass as for what it did. The bill that would have put a deposit on water bottles died for the third year in a row. A no-brainer bill to revoke the pensions of corrupt public officials died in the Senate, the fourth year such a measure did not come up for a vote in the General Assembly. Such a failure is incomprehensible, and makes lawmakers' speeches denouncing corruption ring hollow.\n        Even bills that passed did so with a Keystone Kops quality about the proceedings, or worse, added up to what one observer called ''the sum of all lobbyists.'' The energy bill was a prime example. Citizens who have clamored for lower electric bills should understand precisely what happened, because everyone agreed that if the legislature did nothing else it should find some way to lower rates that are second only to Hawaii's.\n        There were two energy bills. The House's version was thoroughly vetted in committee and on the floor. Yet it was the Senate version that ultimately passed. It was championed by Senator John Fonfara, the Democratic co-chairman of the Energy and Technology Committee, and sprung on the legislature, with the blessing of the leadership, just hours before the vote. Even if lawmakers wanted to read the bill, 165 pages in all, they did not have time.\n        The bill was not all bad; its energy efficiency provisions, for instance, enjoyed broad support. But unlike the original House version of the bill, this proposal increased the power of the market to set Connecticut's electric rates -- ignoring evidence that states that have managed to reduce their rates have also required some state intervention to control generating costs. This bill did not do that.\n        The bill also contained expensive boondoggles. One will require ratepayers to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on expensive and unnecessary meters (they spent $250 million for exactly the same purpose in 2005). And it mandated obscure ''energy efficiency partnerships'' costing $60 million a year to help sell the public on energy saving technologies, but because it requires little accountability or clear procedures for competitive proposals, it invites waste and corruption.\n        This enormously complicated bill did not promise much in the way of lower rates and may in fact increase them. Ms. Rell signed it anyway. Politics is always messy. But Connecticut, which has seen more than its share of corruption, has a special responsibility to set high standards in conducting the people's business. That did not happen often enough this session.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1795264,"ids":1795264,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"After too much confusion and emotional conflict, the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation finally has a leader who can get the job done -- Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n        The mayor has already made the largest single donation to the memorial from his personal fortune and should be invaluable in getting other philanthropists to contribute to the struggling building fund.

But while he was lacking a direct say in the rebuilding, the mayor never gave the problems of Lower Manhattan the kind of attention he gave to projects like the aborted West Side stadium.\n        Since its creation last year, the memorial foundation has been crying out for the kind of leadership and stability that the mayor is capable of providing. Gov. George Pataki, formerly the point man on Lower Manhattan development issues, has been granted the title of honorary lifetime chairman of the foundation. It was hard for any one person to control events at the World Trade Center site, given all the overlapping layers of authority and influence. But whatever the reason, Mr. Pataki has turned out to be more of an overseer than a steady leader in the rebuilding effort downtown.\n        Mayor Bloomberg may have some battles ahead with the likely next governor, Eliot Spitzer, but we would prefer thoughtful disagreements and practical solutions to the sense of drift over the past few years.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1784075,"ids":1784075,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"After years of riding to work in decrepit old train cars like so much cattle, commuters on Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road have seen things get better in the last few years. The railroads have been upgrading their rolling stock with a much-praised new car, the M7, which has big windows you can actually see through, often-clean bathrooms, easy-to-read digital signage and a soothing recorded announcer with a voice as precise and earnest as that of a 1950's sitcom dad, telling you ''This station is '' and otherwise leaving you alone.\n        But there has been a serpent in this paradise. Those of you who wear pleated pants or carry shoulder bags know exactly what it is.\n        It's the armrest, a rubbery protrusion with a beveled end and an infuriating habit of slipping into your pocket unnoticed when you are sitting on the aisle. It lurks there until you reach your station and stand up, at which point it announces its unwelcome presence with a startling rrrip, and perhaps the unhappy jingling of loose change on the floor.\n        Riders have been complaining about this for years. The more assertive ones send tailor bills to their respective railroads, which sometimes pay up. The more sheepish or supine among us just deal with it as yet another in a host of indignities.\n        In a move that is far too late, but welcome anyway, Metro-North and the L.I.R.R. have announced plans to test a new armrest in December and perhaps retrofit hundreds of M7 trains with more rider-friendly seats. The alterations would be phased in during the coming year.\n        It's too bad that it took the railroads so long to act on what amounts to a simple and not very expensive mechanical solution to a problem that has bedeviled riders for quite a while. When an article about the armrests appeared in this paper in May 2004, a spokesman for the L.I.R.R. said 74 claims for torn clothing had been filed with the railroad, which had first unveiled the M7 two years earlier.\n        While it seems that other flaws will still remain -- people find the M7's stiff seats uncomfortable, and too small -- it's comforting that the railroads are finally going after the armrest problem. Our hearts, meanwhile, go out to riders on the New Haven line, who for technical reasons having to do with the use of overhead power lines, are stuck riding older cars. They have experienced neither the benefits nor flaws of the M7 and will have to wait, with weary anticipation, for the M8.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1792315,"ids":1792315,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Ah, to be a pal of Gov.

Last week, New York State's chief judge, Judith Kaye, expressed her frustration, saying she may bring a lawsuit if the logjam over judicial pay persists past the close of the current legislative session.\n        Judge Kaye's complaint is worth paying attention to because no one has done more than she has to improve the state's courts.\n        On a positive note, though, the new state budget includes $8 million in new funding for critical civil legal services for poor people -- a notable advance for New York's justice system that more than doubled last year's budget total.\n        In a further breakthrough, the increase in funding is supported by a general budget appropriation. This represents a healthy break from the debilitating pattern of supporting civil legal services largely through ad hoc member items controlled by individual lawmakers.\n        Ample credit for this progress is due Judge Kaye and Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who showed their commitment to improving access to justice by including funding for civil legal services in their respective budget proposals. And in refreshing contrast to his predecessor, former Gov. George Pataki, Mr. Spitzer did not simply leave it to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Assembly judiciary chair Helene Weinstein, and other concerned lawmakers to carry the ball on the issue.\n        Mr. Spitzer's willingness to exert gubernatorial leadership helped insure that expanded funding to address the basic legal needs of the poor in areas like housing, child support, and spousal and elderly abuse was not lost in the contentious wrangling so common to Albany over other issues like health care and education.\n        Details of how the legal services money will be distributed around the state must still be worked out. But by any reasonable formula, legal services providers in New York City, where the need is especially acute, should receive a sizeable share.\n        Of the 2.5 million people living in poverty in the state, 1.8 million live in the city, according to census figures. A report by the Brennan Center for Justice found that an overwhelming number of poor seniors facing eviction in proceedings in the city's Housing Court lack any legal representation.\n        New York still has a long way to go to bring its funding of essential legal services up to the level of some other states. The contributions of lawyers who provide pro bono legal services remain essential. But with the new budget, the state has at least begun to match their commitment.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1644957,"ids":1644957,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Alberto Gonzales's nomination as attorney general goes before the Senate at a time when the Republican majority is eager to provide newly elected President Bush with the cabinet of his choice, and the Democrats are leery of exposing their weakened status by taking fruitless stands against the inevitable. None of that is an excuse for giving Mr. Gonzales a pass. The attorney general does not merely head up the Justice Department. He is responsible for ensuring that America is a nation in which justice prevails. Mr. Gonzales's record makes him unqualified to take on this role or to represent the American justice system to the rest of the world. The Senate should reject his nomination.\n        The biggest strike against Mr. Gonzales is the now repudiated memo that gave a disturbingly narrow definition of torture, limiting it to physical abuse that produced pain of the kind associated with organ failure or death. Mr. Gonzales's attempts to distance himself from the memo have been unconvincing, especially since it turns out he was the one who requested that it be written. Earlier the same year, Mr. Gonzales himself sent President Bush a letter telling him that the war on terror made the Geneva Conventions' strict limitations on the questioning of enemy prisoners ''obsolete.''\n        These actions created the legal climate that made possible the horrific mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners being held in Abu Ghraib prison. The Bush administration often talks about its desire to mend fences with the rest of the world, particularly the Muslim world. Making Mr. Gonzales the nation's chief law enforcement officer would set this effort back substantially.\n        Other parts of Mr. Gonzales's record are also troubling. As counsel to George Bush when he was governor of Texas, Mr. Gonzales did a shockingly poor job of laying out the legal issues raised by the clemency petitions from prisoners on death row. And questions have been raised about Mr. Gonzales's account of how he got his boss out of jury duty in 1996, which allowed Mr. Bush to avoid stating publicly that he had been convicted of drunken driving.\n        Senate Democrats, who are trying to define their role after the setbacks of the 2004 election, should stand on principle and hold out for a more suitable attorney general. Republicans also have reason to oppose this nomination. At the confirmation hearings, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, warned that the administration's flawed legal policies and mistreatment of detainees had hurt the country's standing and ''dramatically undermined'' the war on terror. Given the stakes in that war, senators of both parties should want an attorney general who does not come with this nominee's substantial shortcomings.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1665462,"ids":1665462,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Almost 10 years ago, New York lawmakers agreed that it was time to give potential patients some idea of how they might fare in any hospital in the state. So they ordered the Health Department to draw up report cards for the 250 or so hospitals in the state. That was in early 1996, and so far, no report cards.\n        That lack of state accountability is no small failing. It could be dangerous, even deadly, for those trying to find out where to go for surgery. Which hospitals have the least medical errors? Nationally, there are up to 98,000 deaths from these errors. In New York, patients do not know when these errors have occurred and, most important, where. Which have fewer hospital infections? About one in 20 patients will get one of these infections, despite increased efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in recent years. New York's Health Department could save lives and money if it was known where, and ultimately why, hospitalized patients are likely to get infections.\n        What you do not know about your hospital can hurt you, badly. But there is another reason why report cards are needed quickly. State officials are focusing on how to cut soaring Medicaid costs. The debate should not be about merely cutting costs -- or, in Albany, about which lobbyists should not be roused to anger. It should be about how to get the best care for $45 billion in Medicaid money.\n        As part of cost-cutting plans, lawmakers are expected to create a commission similar to the one that helped the Pentagon decide which military bases to shut down. New York's version of that commission would be asked to devise a plan to reduce the number of beds as a way to save on Medicaid costs. There are many factors -- financial, geographical, political -- that will go into these decisions. But it would also be nice to know which hospitals actually are best at curing their customers.\n        If that sounds difficult and complicated, it is. Some hospitals take sicker patients, and thus inevitably have a higher number of deaths. But it is not impossible to adjust for such differences.\n        Almost 15 years ago, Albany led the nation in measuring the quality of coronary bypass surgery -- doctor by doctor and hospital by hospital. The medical community railed at the intrusion, especially when the data was made public, but the patients were the winners. The study not only focused public attention on this popular and important procedure, but also gave consumers a better chance to shop for the best place to have it done. New York became an early model for other states, including Pennsylvania and California, which made similar efforts to assess the quality of their health care.\n        New York has now fallen behind. State residents can find some information online about their doctors, and there is data on nursing homes, both on the Health Department Web site. But that is not enough. The health commissioner, Antonia Novello, promised that the hospital report cards would be ready by late 2000. It is now 2005. The word is that they should be ready next year. That's late and, for a lot of patients, too late.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":25,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1821983,"ids":1821983,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Almost anybody who has ever done anything big knows that the first step involves clearing the desk.

Besides budget reform, which Mr. Spitzer signed into law last week, the next step is a series of changes the governor has labeled a ''dramatic, significant, fundamental step forward'' in ethics reform.\n        Every politician who is near a microphone talks about how Albany needs to be more ethical. But anyone who has spent any time in New York State's Capitol knows that many of these same politicians have no real interest in change at all.\n        So, even as Mr. Spitzer and the legislative leaders promise reform, the real fear is that the reforms will turn out to be about as deep as their television pancake makeup. To take one example, the leaders propose an independent ethics review board that would combine the functions of the State Ethics Commission, which monitors state government, and the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying, which monitors lobbying.\n        Good-government advocates are understandably wary. Could this be a ploy to get rid of Albany's least favorite and most independent investigator: David Grandeau, the head of the lobbying commission? Is it yet another grand Albany-style trick or is it in fact a serious effort to air out the Capitol?\n        Other proposals on the agenda seem more promising, assuming that they are carried out. A proposed ban on gifts has long been necessary. Another ban, on honorariums, is also long overdue. And putting a foot in the revolving door that allows legislative staff members to retire, then immediately start making big money by lobbying old colleagues, would be a real improvement -- although this reform would not start until the end of 2008.\n        We hope there is even more to come. Mr. Spitzer is pushing forward with campaign finance reform in ways that would lower contribution limits, close loopholes and establish some sort of public financing. The torrents of money pouring into the hotly contested special election in Nassau County from both parties remind us that New York's present system of campaign financing is a statewide embarrassment that needs fixing quickly.\n        Mr. Spitzer also proposes a nonpartisan redistricting commission. This would amount to a fundamental and greatly needed change in a system that essentially allows legislators to design their own districts and thus perpetuate their political careers.\n        Blair Horner, head of Albany's branch of the New York Public Interest Research Group, has for years been hearing promises of ethics reform. Like most good-government advocates, he believes that an ''opportunity to radically overhaul the state's ethics laws comes along only once in a generation.''

The attorney general, John Ashcroft, said Mr. Padilla was a Qaeda-trained terrorist so dangerous that he was being tossed into a Navy brig and the key was being thrown away.\n        The administration hotly defended its right to hold Mr. Padilla without legal process because he was declared an unlawful enemy combatant, one of the new powers that President Bush granted himself after 9\/11. The administration fought the case up to the Supreme Court. Mr. Padilla's plot was thwarted, the Justice Department claimed, only because of the government's ability to hold suspected terrorists in secretive prisons where they were sweated, to put it mildly, for information. The ''dirty bomb'' plot supposedly was divulged by a top Qaeda member who had been interrogated 100 times at one such location.\n        Never mind. As of yesterday, Mr. Padilla stopped being an unlawful combatant, and the new attorney general, Alberto Gonzales, refused even to talk about that issue. Mr. Padilla is not going to be charged with planning to explode bombs, dirty or otherwise, in the United States. Just in time for the administration to prod Congress on extending the Patriot Act and to avoid having to argue the case before the Supreme Court, Mr. Padilla was charged with aiding terrorists in other countries and will be turned over to civilian authorities.\n        Mr. Padilla was added late in the game, and in a minor role, to a continuing case against four other men. He faces serious charges that carry a possible life sentence, but they do nothing to clear up the enormous legal questions created by this case, nor do they have the remotest connection with the original accusations.\n        The Padilla case was supposed to be an example of why the administration needs to suspend prisoners' rights when it comes to the war on terror. It turned out to be the opposite. If Mr. Padilla was seriously planning a ''dirty bomb'' attack, he can never be held accountable for it in court because the illegal conditions under which he has been held will make it impossible to do that. If he was only an inept fellow traveler in the terrorist community, he is excellent proof that the government is fallible and needs the normal checks of the judicial system. And, of course, if he is innocent, he was the victim of a terrible injustice.\n        The same is true of the hundreds of other men held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and in the C.I.A.'s secret prisons. This is hardly what Americans have had in mind hearing Mr. Bush's constant assurances since Sept. 11, 2001, that he will bring terrorists to justice.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1659495,"ids":1659495,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Almost two months have passed since Iraq's elections, and people there are understandably impatient to see a new government take office. But the real problem isn't the delay. Lengthy haggling over cabinet posts and other turf issues was inevitable among fledging politicians with no previous experience of democratic give-and-take. What is far more troubling are the significant sections of the Iraqi population whose rights could be sacrificed when the Shiite religious parties and autonomy-minded Kurdish leaders who were the election's biggest winners cut their final deal. Those who need to worry most at this point are women, Sunni Arabs and secular Iraqis of both sexes.\n        Saddam Hussein's sadistic and murderous dictatorship was no feminist paradise. But Iraqi women still managed to maintain access to educational, professional and personal opportunities denied to many of their sisters in neighboring Arab and Islamic countries. Now the future of these freedoms is in serious question. The dominant bloc of Shiite religious parties, along with their candidate for prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, want Iraq's new constitution to be directly inspired by conservative Islamic religious teachings derived from the Koran.\n        The secular Kurdish parties whose agreement is also needed to form a governing majority have the most leverage to resist these religious pressures. But the Kurds are focused mainly on maximizing their own region's independence. They seem far more interested in spending their political capital attaching the oil-rich city of Kirkuk to the territory of a future Kurdistan than in protecting the rights of secular Iraqis. Already, the Shiites seem set to control the powerful Interior Ministry, which will run major police agencies. If the Kurds also concede to them ministries like education and women's affairs, they could be consigning Iraqi women to a life of subjugation and millions of secular Iraqis, male and female, to a bleak, Iran-like future.\n        The other unspoken issue haunting these negotiations is the violently estranged Sunni Arab minority. With very few representative Sunnis now at the table, finding a way to recognize a legitimate Sunni leadership in the government will require some creative ingenuity. Yet until Shiite and Kurdish leaders recognize their own vital interest in making this happen, no progress is likely. With a new, permanent constitution due to be drawn up later this year, time is rapidly running out.\n        It is now out of the question for Washington to try and micromanage Iraqi political development. That would mock the elections and the claims of Iraqi self-government. But with more than 1,500 American troops already dead in Iraq and the next Iraqi government clearly dependent on the protection of more than 100,000 United States troops, Washington is not just entitled, but obliged to make clear America's interest in a free, democratic and unified Iraq. This country cannot be complicit in allowing haggling politicians to subordinate those goals to their own narrow religious, separatist or divisive agendas.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1664115,"ids":1664115,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Along a border between Mexico and Arizona, a few dozen gunslingers are patrolling for illegal immigrants, and the fact that they have attracted mostly television cameras so far takes little away from the danger they pose to themselves and others. It would be far saner to leave the patrolling of the border to the border patrol. These self-proclaimed ''Minutemen'' -- whom President Bush has rightly labeled vigilantes -- should put their guns away and look where the real solutions to America's flawed immigration policy should be found: in Washington.\n        Mr. Bush is the only one who can really stop the ''Minutemen'' from taking the law into their own hands. Instead of letting the locals cope with illegal aliens who die in boxcars or commit crimes within the protections of their shadowy world, it's time for the president to take up the cause about which he has said much but done little.\n        Mr. Bush has long talked about a more humane and secure guest-worker plan -- often speaking with passion and empathy about his own experiences in Texas. His best speeches about those millions of immigrants who work at the nation's lowliest jobs are usually to Hispanic audiences that know the painful stories well and are part of a voting group the Republicans badly need.\n        While the president has failed to push immigration reform, some of his fellow Republicans, like Representative James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, are seizing the issue, in effect doing the same thing to the immigration debate that the vigilantes are doing on the border.\n        Mr. Sensenbrenner got the House to pass an anti-immigrant measure called the Real ID bill. The Senate should avoid it altogether since the legislation would further penalize those who have escaped to America from politically treacherous regimes by setting up an unnecessarily strict standard for granting asylum. In some cases, immigrants might need written ''corroboration'' of their persecution from the persecutors themselves.\n        The bill would also bar the federal government from recognizing driver's licenses from states that do not verify the driver's immigration status. For the 11 states that have wisely decided that the point of a driver's license is to make sure someone knows how to drive, that could mean extra trouble. Drivers from those states, which include even Mr. Sensenbrenner's own Wisconsin, might not be able to use their licenses to board airplanes or enter federal buildings. Moreover, this bill comes as the federal government is already outlining new rules for state licenses that have been carefully balanced to weigh these concerns.\n        What Mr. Sensenbrenner's bill really tries to do is turn a driver's license into a de facto national ID card. That issue is too important to be slipped like this through the back door. More ominously, this bill could interfere with the kind of broad bipartisan reform effort that Mr. Bush has appeared to support. A reform package now being put together in the Senate by John McCain of Arizona and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts is the kind of humane legislation that the president should embrace.\n        In the meantime, you have to feel sorry for the people in places like Arizona -- the residents, the immigrants and the border police.

While some environmentalists point to the wreckage as a kind of retribution for America's failure to control greenhouse gas emissions, right-wing talk show hosts repeat, over and over, that even if global warming did exist, there is no proof it had anything to do with Rita and Katrina.\n        In a way, they're all right. It is impossible to link Katrina or Rita, or any particular hurricane, specifically to global warming. This does not mean that President Bush and the rest of us should not be connecting the dots. These are natural disasters -- but with human fingerprints.\n        Hurricanes derive their strength from warm ocean waters. Ocean temperatures have been rising over the last 100 years, along with atmospheric temperatures. Hurricanes have therefore become bigger and more destructive and are likely to grow even more violent in the future.\n        This cycle cannot be reversed any time soon. But one thing humans can do is to reduce their own contribution to global warming by controlling industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The alarm bells have been ringing for a long time, but Katrina and Rita should serve as yet another warning to an administration that has belittled the science of global warming.\n        The emerging hurricane problem is size, not quantity. The scientists who have studied the issue have not detected any increase in the number of hurricanes. Yet these same scientists -- in research reports appearing in reputable journals like Science, Nature and The Journal of Climate -- have detected increases of up to 70 percent in hurricane intensity, a measure that combines the power of a hurricane and its duration. There has been a commensurate increase in damage, mainly because more and more people have stubbornly put themselves at risk by moving to low-lying coastal areas. But the hurricanes' added strength has clearly contributed to the ever-higher toll in lives and property damage.\n        Being cautious folk, the scientists point out that cyclical lulls and surges in hurricane activity may also have something to do with stronger storms. But even if they are completely wrong in linking warming to intensity, which seems unlikely, global warming will have other undesirable consequences, including a significant rise in sea level. In the last century, sea level rose 4 to 8 inches around the world, and most scientists expect a further rise of 2 to 3 feet in this century.\n        According to one government study, a 20-inch rise in sea level by 2100 could put 3,500 square miles of the southern coast of the United States underwater -- rendering efforts to restore the Everglades and the Louisiana coastline essentially pointless. A large-scale breakup of the polar ice sheets would, of course, make matters much worse. Dikes could protect some regions, like Manhattan and the Netherlands, but most coastlines would be inundated.\n        Humanity cannot avoid a warmer Earth and some rise in sea level, largely because of the gases we have already deposited in the atmosphere. But the worst outcomes may be avoided if the world takes concerted action to stabilize industrial emissions of greenhouse gases.\n        This, of course, presupposes aggressive leadership from the United States, which produces more than a quarter of these emissions. But this is a role that Mr. Bush has shown no appetite for at all.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1826592,"ids":1826592,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"American autoworkers are suffering through another round of layoffs, factory closings and buyouts. This time DaimlerChrysler has announced that it will cut 13,000 jobs in North America. Ford Motor and General Motors offered buyouts to a total of nearly 200,000 hourly workers in 2006.\n        These losses stoke fears that America's manufacturing base is disappearing, that the country is ''de-industrializing.'' With the loss of three million American factory jobs since the end of 2000 and the trade deficit at an all-time high, it's easy to see China's spectacular growth and assume that American factories are being gutted by foreign competition.\n        But global competition is not the whole cause for the car manufacturers' problems, just as the answers are not to be found in protectionism.\n        Many of the car companies' difficulties stem from some bad decisions by management and some uninspired car designs. Chrysler lost $1.48 billion last year and Ford lost $12.7 billion, the most in more than a century in business, while Toyota reported record profits and sales.\n        The plight of the workers who have lost their jobs is real and has to be addressed, but the U.S. manufacturing sector is far more robust than the struggle of the carmakers suggests. According to the United Nations, the United States accounted for 21.2 percent of world manufacturing in 2000. As China surged ahead in recent years, the American share of world manufacturing barely budged, falling to 21.1 percent by 2005, the most recent year available. American factories produced a record $1.5 trillion in goods that year.\n        In part, that's because foreign companies have invested so much in factory capacity in America. In a recent report, a Democratic research organization, the Progressive Policy Institute, cited government figures showing that foreign manufacturers invest billions more in the United States than American manufacturers invest abroad. Toyota provides over 29,000 manufacturing jobs in this country.\n        Many of the jobs that have disappeared did not drain off to foreign competition, but to technological change on the shop floor. Robots and computers have allowed far fewer workers to produce more than ever. That kind of high-tech manufacturing is one reason successful American companies like Boeing and Caterpillar can compete with companies in countries where the labor costs are low.\n        This is not to ignore the human dimension. It is too easy for free trade advocates to blame the robots and then ignore the pain of the blue-collar workers they have sidelined. The suffering in places like Ohio, Indiana and Michigan is very real, and so is the political backlash that results. The long-term answer will deal with the vexing question of how to train American workers for a new world of jobs. But there are more short-term issues as well, starting with taking care of those Americans, middle aged and older, who suddenly find themselves without jobs right now.\n        The burden falls on pro-trade politicians and those who support them, unless they want to see high tariffs and duties, which will ultimately choke global and domestic growth. Just to start, pro-trade politicians have to make sure that a lost factory job does not mean a drastic and lasting decline in living standards, with no access to health insurance and no hope for a college education for that worker's children. As the tide rises, this country cannot allow millions to drown.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1824221,"ids":1824221,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"American troops under fire in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve every penny requested for them in President Bush's new $622 billion Pentagon budget. And the overstretched Army and Marine Corps clearly need support, along with the extra troops that will eventually come their way. But that still leaves more than half of the overall request for Congress to carefully scrutinize and significantly prune.\n        Apart from war costs and personnel increases, this budget slips in more than $40 billion in other spending increases, compared with last year. Since Mr. Bush took office, the Pentagon budget has more than doubled. It is now higher, in real terms, than it has been in the past half-century.\n        Congress should direct particular attention to the roughly $140 billion in weapons procurement, research and development costs that are not part of the Iraq and Afghanistan section of the budget. Far too many of these programs are products of cold war strategic thinking and have outlived their rationale in a world with no superpower arms race.\n        That includes the $4.6 billion slated for the Air Force's F-22 stealth fighter, the $2.6 billion for the Marine Corps' tilt-wing V-22 Osprey, the $3 billion for the Navy's DDG-1000 stealth destroyer and $2.5 billion for the Virginia-class attack submarine. It also includes much of the $15.9 billion going to space weapons and missile defense.\n        Several of these programs can be canceled outright. The F-22 is one of three new-generation stealth fighters, and the most expendable because it was originally designed for air-to-air combat against Soviet-style MIG fighters. Likewise, the Virginia-class submarine was designed to track enemy nuclear submarines. The DDG-1000 is a blue-water fighting fortress, when what the Navy really needs these days is smaller, faster ships that can operate in shallow coastal waters.\n        It makes sense to provide the Navy and Air Force with adequate means to maintain their current comfortable margins of superiority over any probable foe. That can still be done for billions of dollars less than President Bush has just requested.\n        If the new Democratic-controlled Congress is serious about reducing budget deficits and finding the money to pay for acute domestic needs, it will have to pare back the most extravagant elements of this fantasy weapons wish list. Special responsibility falls on the Armed Services Committee chairmen in both houses, Senator Carl Levin and Representative Ike Skelton. Addiction to military pork is the one area in which bipartisanship has flourished in Washington in the past six years.\n        This nation can afford to pay for all of its legitimate military needs. What it cannot afford are costly jobs programs disguised as defense and the wasteful weapons projects promoted by an army of well-connected Washington lobbyists.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1839718,"ids":1839718,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Americans are weary enough of presidential candidates who blurt out one of those intellectually dishonest sound bites known as ''the pander'' when they are caught in the last moments of a do-or-die race. But what are they to make of a candidate who goes straight to the pandering, with comments that are offensive to millions of people?\n        That's what we found ourselves asking when Rudolph Giuliani told reporters in Alabama that it should be up to the state to decide whether to fly the Confederate battle flag over its Capitol. Never mind that the flag has not flown there for nearly 15 years. Never mind that nobody is pushing to return it. Never mind that lawsuits have been decided on this issue and that millions of Americans find the standard to be a symbol of slavery and repression.\n        Explaining his let-them-fly-flags philosophy, he declaimed that one of the ''great beauties'' of American government is that ''we can make different decisions in different parts of the country.''\n        He added: ''We have different sensitivities.''\n        Mr. Giuliani cannot truly believe the issues surrounding the Confederate flag are just a matter of local taste. The Civil War, the civil rights movement and the Supreme Court answered that question. Even the Southern states have largely moved on.\n        If he missed all of that, surely he noticed how Senator John McCain humiliated himself in 2000 over the flag in a vain attempt to win the primary in South Carolina. There is no excusing that pandering, but at least the flag was an issue that year in that state. In 2007, Mr. Giuliani simply looks as if he wants to convince voters that no matter what his beliefs are, they should vote for him anyway because he's prepared to put them aside.\n        He said he believes in the right to own guns, but he would let the states decide how to regulate them. The other day he said he was for abortion rights and preened about his political courage. Then he refused to say whether states should spend public money on abortions or require a woman to view an ultrasound picture of her fetus before an abortion.\n        Mr. Giuliani ought to stop waving in the wind, because that would be the right thing to do. It is also not working. Southern political strategists said he's too moderate on abortion and pronounced him dead in their states.

First, a Senate committee pretty much killed President Bush's Clear Skies initiative, a deeply flawed rewrite of the country's basic clean air laws. It would have done more for the industries that pollute the air (and helped write the bill) than for the people who breathe it. The committee's action was swiftly followed by a new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency aimed at significantly reducing the smog, soot and acid rain caused by power plant emissions in the East and Midwest.\n        The agency had held the new rule in reserve in case Congress could not agree on Clear Skies. Known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule, it is intended to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, which help create smog, by 60 percent over 10 years, and of sulfur dioxide, which creates soot, by more than 70 percent. Both contribute to acid rain, a scourge of Northeastern forests like the Adirondacks.\n        Clear Skies had essentially the same targets and timetables. But Clear Skies would also have gutted several vital Clean Air Act provisions that Eastern states in particular have found useful in combating windblown pollution from other states. One of these provisions requires power plants to install state-of-the-art pollution controls whenever they significantly upgrade plants. Another allows states to sue each other over windblown pollution.\n        The new rule, in other words, has all of the upside of Clear Skies with none of the downside. It could have been stronger. But there is no reason that it cannot be strengthened in the future, and state officials -- who are ultimately responsible under the Clean Air Act for providing their residents with healthy air -- still have access to the various regulatory mechanisms that Mr. Bush's Clear Skies proposals would have taken away.\n        The next piece of news on the clean air front is likely to be much less cheery for the environmental community than this week's news. The E.P.A. is scheduled to unveil on Wednesday its long-awaited rule on mercury, a highly toxic pollutant that has been found in fish.\n        Because previous administrations largely ducked the mercury issue, this will be the first effort to regulate mercury emissions from power plants, which are responsible for about 48 of the 113 tons produced in the United States every year. Environmentalists are sure to argue, however, that the rule fails to control local depositions of mercury, does not exploit proven technologies that could lead to even greater reductions and, in general, is biased toward industry.\n        This much is certain: the clean air wars, which have been a reliable feature of the political landscape in Washington ever since the original Clean Air Act was passed more than 34 years ago, will continue, in the courts if not in Congress.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1831408,"ids":1831408,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Americans often suspect that their political leaders are arrogant and out of touch.

The hearings left little doubt that the Bush administration had all eight -- an unprecedented number -- ousted for political reasons. But it points to even wider abuse; prosecutors suggest that three Republican members of Congress may have tried to pressure the attorneys into doing their political bidding.\n        It already seemed clear that the Bush administration's purge had trampled on prosecutorial independence. Now Congress and the Justice Department need to investigate possible ethics violations, and perhaps illegality. Two of the fired prosecutors testified that they had been dismissed after resisting what they suspected were importunings to use their offices to help Republicans win elections. A third described what may have been a threat of retaliation if he talked publicly about his firing.\n        David Iglesias, who was removed as the United States attorney in Albuquerque, said that he was first contacted before last fall's election by Representative Heather Wilson, Republican of New Mexico. Ms. Wilson, who was in a tough re-election fight, asked about sealed indictments -- criminal charges that are not public.\n        Two weeks later, he said, he got a call from Senator Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, asking whether he intended to indict Democrats before the election in a high-profile corruption case. When Mr. Iglesias said no, he said, Mr. Domenici replied that he was very sorry to hear it, and the line went dead. Mr. Iglesias said he'd felt ''sick.'' Within six weeks, he was fired. Ms. Wilson and Mr. Domenici both deny that they had tried to exert pressure.\n        John McKay of Seattle testified that the chief of staff for Representative Doc Hastings, Republican of Washington, called to ask whether he intended to investigate the 2004 governor's race, which a Democrat won after two recounts. Mr. McKay says that when he went to the White House later to discuss a possible judicial nomination (which he did not get), he was told of concerns about how he'd handled the election. H. E. Cummins, a fired prosecutor from Arkansas, said that a Justice Department official, in what appeared to be a warning, said that if he kept talking about his firing, the department would release negative information about him.\n        Congress must keep demanding answers. It must find out who decided to fire these prosecutors and why, and who may have authorized putting pressure on Mr. Cummins. And it must look into whether Senator Domenici and Representatives Wilson and Hastings violated ethics rules that forbid this sort of interference.

After wasting weeks with hearings that have no purpose but to trash the Senate's immigration bill and to boost their party at the polls, House Republican leaders have scheduled 21 more hearings from late July into September. This marathon of doing nothing mocks the voters who say they want action on immigration this year and shows how President Bush has failed to lead Congress and the nation toward the reform he says he so badly wants.\n        The only hint of motion in this stagnant pond was the unveiling of a new immigration bill this week by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Representative Mike Pence of Indiana. The bill distills into one noxious package what hard-line Republicans stand for, and shows how pulled they are between one faction that wants to harass and expel illegal immigrants and another that is desperate to keep hiring them on the cheap.\n        Hutchison-Pence defers to the Republican wing that is fixated on expelling millions of illegal immigrants. None of its provisions for workers would take effect until the president declared the border sealed. People who came here illegally would have to leave and get in line at ''Ellis Island centers'' in Mexico and Central America to apply for special work visas for whatever jobs might await them.\n        The visas would entitle immigrants to spend two years as peons, eligible to work but not to receive social services. Their Medicare payroll deductions would disappear into a fund to reimburse hospitals for emergency care of foreigners. Social Security deductions would be refundable only when an immigrant left the program (and the country).\n        The two-year visas could be renewed for up to 12 years. After that, a worker could apply for another visa and work five more years. After that 17-year odyssey, immigrants would theoretically be eligible for permanent residency. But the bill does not raise the number of green cards for unskilled workers -- now about 5,000, a droplet in the sea of 500,000 people who cross the border each year. It's a hypothetical path to citizenship that ends cruelly at a brick wall.\n        The bill has plenty of other crippling flaws, including many offensive provisions from the House's enforcement-only immigration bill.\n        Mr. Pence says it gives illegal immigrants a chance to leave the country and enter the right way -- to ''reboot,'' in other words. But that is a corrupting obfuscation, just like the theft of those golden words ''Ellis Island'' for what amounts to a shabby back door to indentured servitude. There is a better way to solve the immigration problem. It involves taking inspiration from American values of fairness, practicality and openness to newcomers. It means recognizing that a hidden nation of 12 million immigrants will not deport itself, and that even a hyper-militarized border will not control the flow unless there is also a plan to give real opportunity, with dignity, to those willing to work hard for it.\n        The raw materials of such a solution lie in the Senate's flawed but fixable immigration bill. We keep waiting for President Bush to demand that Republican leaders stop the delays, distractions and semantic charades and hammer out the repairs.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1737394,"ids":1737394,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Americans spent more than they made in 2005, sending the personal savings rate into negative territory for the first time since 1933.\n        Government and business should be alarmed. Many Americans do not seem to believe they are living beyond their means, as long as the value of their houses are rising. But spending freely while the house appreciates is not saving for the future. It is betting that boom-time gains will last indefinitely. They will not.\n        Meanwhile, traditional corporate pension plans are disappearing; half of the people with 401(k)'s have saved less than $20,000; and about one-third of households have saved nothing for retirement.\n        Policy makers must act quickly to avert a crisis. To start, they should strengthen 401(k)'s, now the main retirement plan for 42 million Americans, about half of the work force.\n        By removing various legal obstacles facing employers, a pension reform bill moving through Congress would help employers who offer 401(k)'s to enroll more employees and to encourage higher contributions. Those are good first steps, but they're the easy part. More needs to be done to help those who are trying to save for retirement, including:\n        INVESTMENT ADVICE -- Employers are reluctant to provide 401(k) investment advice for fear of being held responsible if the investments go south. The Senate has passed a sensible measure to shield employers if they hire advisers who are independent, qualified and properly supervised. The House should follow suit. A proposal from John Boehner, the new majority leader, to allow mutual funds to offer advice should be rejected. It allows for a clear conflict of interest, since the fund companies that would be advising employees are among the employees' 401(k) choices.\n        AUTOMATIC ROLLOVER -- Employees who cash out their 401(k) plans when changing jobs -- about half do -- cheat themselves because it is very difficult to make up the lost savings later. Rules that require an automatic rollover -- to a new employer's 401(k) or an individual retirement account -- would stanch much of the bleeding.\n        MAKING IT LAST -- Government must help ensure that retirees do not outlive their money. For many retirees, it would be prudent to convert savings into an annuity that would guarantee a stream of income for life. But the average 401(k) balance for people in their 60's is about $140,000, and financial companies cannot profitably offer annuities for such relatively small sums. Research suggests that the government could provide annuities for 401(k) savers who have $50,000 to $200,000 at modest cost.\n        It simply makes no sense, socially or economically, for each person to increasingly bear the risks of financing old age when that risk is more efficiently borne on the much broader shoulders of Washington and corporate America. What America needs are leaders who understand that asking ordinary citizens to assume ever-greater risks is not the path to greater security.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1848664,"ids":"1848664,1848781","split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Among former Gov.

Decades after an era of epic legal struggles, including the federal lawsuit over desegregating public housing in Yonkers, the issue has gone largely underground. Every elected official seems to agree that places like Westchester desperately need affordable housing -- which is more often called ''workforce housing'' or ''next-generation housing'' these days, to avoid provoking race-based jitters in white suburban enclaves -- but nobody really builds any.\n        This has led to great frustration among those who think a commitment to affordable housing should extend into the real world -- not the world of task forces and planning initiatives, but of bricks and drywall. This includes the New York City suburbs, where housing segregation by class and ethnicity is starkly obvious, and where the progress in building new units has been meager and largely confined to communities with already disproportionately healthy populations of people who are black and Hispanic, poor and immigrant.\n        An advocacy group, the Anti-Discrimination Center of Metro New York, has taken a novel and aggressive tack in getting affordable housing onto the front burner again. It sued Westchester County last month in federal District Court in Manhattan, accusing it of doing too little to promote new affordable housing and of failing to reduce existing segregation. It says the county accepted $45 million in federal grants for developing such housing, but since units aren't being built and communities are as segregated as ever, the county should give the money back.\n        The county's reaction to the lawsuit was precise and emphatic -- Susan Tolchin, an aide to County Executive Andrew Spano, called it ''garbage,'' insisting that the county has no authority under state law to tell towns and villages how to use their land. Its only power, she said, is persuasive, and by those measures you could easily call Westchester's behavior exemplary. It has made land for affordable housing available at low cost to developers, distributed videos on the wonders of workforce housing, and issued inspiring (but toothless) recommendations listing the numbers of affordable units that each municipality -- in a more enlightened world, perhaps -- should build.\n        But the numbers have barely budged, and so the Anti-Discrimination Center argues, in turn, that the county should have taken a much harder line, withholding funds from communities that in its view have failed to comply with the federal Fair Housing Act. It also accused the county of acting in bad faith when it certified that its communities had met the demands of the act, which include a requirement to ''affirmatively further'' fair housing.\n        ''Westchester was all carrot and no stick, even in the face of experience that the all-carrot approach didn't work,'' Craig Gurian, the Center's executive director, told Mr. Fessenden.\n        It is not necessary to calibrate the merits or the odds of success of the lawsuit to accept a premise behind it: that government at all levels needs to use every tool it has to break down traditional resistance to new affordable housing. Old patterns die hard. The great Yonkers battle is still being played out, decades after it erupted. As rhetorically pleasing as Westchester County's attempts to encourage new affordable housing have been, the results are far from inspiring. The progress has been too slow, and the frustration, only naturally, is building.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1700343,"ids":1700343,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"An authoritative scientific report commissioned by the United Nations has found that the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in rural Ukraine -- the worst nuclear accident in history -- caused far less health and environmental damage than originally feared. The findings offer clues for coping with a major release of radiation from a nuclear plant, whether caused by terrorists or by an accident.\n        No sooner had the report been issued this week than it was attacked by several environmental groups as a biased attempt to whitewash the potential dangers of nuclear power. But the report reflects the consensus of eight United Nations agencies, including those responsible for health, the environment and nuclear power, and the governments of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.\n        The explosion at one of Chernobyl's reactors sent chunks of the core into surrounding fields and spewed clouds of radioactive particles into the air for days afterward, contaminating large swaths of land downwind. There were dire predictions that tens of thousands, possibly even hundreds of thousands, of people might die from radiation-related illnesses. So far 56 deaths have been directly attributed to the accident, 47 among emergency workers and 9 among young children who developed thyroid cancer after drinking contaminated milk.\n        In the long run, the experts predict, some 4,000 emergency workers and residents of the most contaminated areas may die from radiation-induced cancer. That qualifies Chernobyl as a very serious accident but not a catastrophe.\n        The greatest harm was inflicted on emergency workers; some succumbed quickly to acute radiation sickness and show a slight rise in leukemia. This suggests that proper equipment for such workers can greatly mitigate the health damage after an accident. In the wider region, the most concrete damage has been thyroid cancer, which has afflicted some 4,000 children. Some 99 percent were treated successfully, and 9 died. Efforts in areas around nuclear plants to stockpile pills that block thyroid cancer appear well advised.\n        Most emergency workers and residents of contaminated areas received relatively low radiation doses, comparable to natural background exposures in some areas of the world. So there have been no decreases in fertility and no increases in birth defects.\n        Instead, the greatest public health hazard has been mental. People from the region are anxious and fatalistic, based on a greatly exaggerated view of the risks they face. The result can be drug and alcohol abuse, unemployment, and an inability to function. Disaster coordinators will clearly have to factor mental health effects into their planning.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1764885,"ids":1764885,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"An evil genius is the tick, which spreads disease by hiding in the fur of adorable woodland creatures. We freely slaughter the disease-bearing mosquito, but cannot as easily assault the tick because of our love for the white-tailed deer, its dainty, doe-eyed hostage. Instead of culling overabundant herds of suburban deer, we argue over how to subdue them with compassion, by fencing ourselves in, adjusting our gardening techniques or promoting deer family planning. The sturdy tick laughs, and multiplies.\n        This looks to be another bad tick summer in Westchester and throughout the Northeast. Checking for ticks and taking antibiotics are a way of life in the region. Reports of Lyme disease were up 34 percent last year in Connecticut. On Shelter Island, the Long Island community that has the highest incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne ailments in Suffolk County, the term ''Shelter Island foreplay'' describes nothing naughty but rather the fastidious monkey business of checking one another for ticks before bedtime.\n        Researchers have recently identified new infectious agents carried by deer ticks; considering the diseases ticks already cause -- Lyme disease, babesiosis, human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, human monocytic ehrlichiosis and Southern tick-associated rash illness -- the thought of more opportunistic microorganisms can bring one to the brink of despair.\n        But there may be a way out that satisfies even those who flinch at killing deer. It's known as the four-poster bait station. It was developed by the federal government and works by applying a tick-killing chemical, permethrin, to the heads and necks of deer. Deer are lured to a bin baited with corn kernels. When they stoop to eat, they rub against permethrin-soaked rollers. One station can treat all the deer in about 100 acres, and tests in other states suggest that the invention can do wonderfully devastating things to tick populations.\n        But there's one big problem: New York does not allow four-poster devices. The Department of Environmental Conservation is not convinced that they are safe or effective, and it opposes feeding wild deer. Feeding deer makes them congregate, which increases the risk of spreading chronic wasting disease, a devastating infection similar to mad cow disease.\n        The department also warns that dotting the landscape with chemical hot spots may not be such a good idea for children and other living things.\n        This seems to be a classic collision between worthy aims: protecting health of wildlife and the environment on the one hand, and controlling a public health emergency on the other. Frustrated advocates of four-posters point to the perversity of regulations that forbid the devices but permit homeowners to spray pesticides containing permethrin at will, saturating leaves that deer nibble on and putting ground water at risk. Some on Shelter Island are eagerly awaiting the imminent publication of a five-year, federally financed study they predict will validate the advocates' claims about the safety and effectiveness of four-poster devices.\n        If that happens, there would seem to be room for a compromise. A place like Shelter Island, whose deer herds are naturally isolated, should be allowed to install four-posters in a carefully monitored experiment. If we can't agree on what to do about the deer, we should at least try to kill the ticks.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1796192,"ids":1796192,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Anna Politkovskaya, gunned down over the weekend in Moscow, was the 13th Russian journalist killed since Vladimir Putin became president -- and one of the bravest. We may never know who killed her because politically motivated crimes have a way of never being solved in Mr. Putin's Russia.\n        There is no question about whom Ms. Politkovskaya held responsible in years of unflinching reporting from Chechnya: the Russian Army and Mr. Putin himself. When he finally got around to acknowledging her death yesterday it was in a cold-blooded statement that the authorities ''will take every step to investigate objectively the tragic death of the journalist Politkovskaya.''\n        Ms. Politkovskaya was 48, the mother of two grown children. She lived alone, in part because of the dangers of her job. On Saturday, she was about to deliver a major report to her newspaper about torture in Chechnya when a killer ambushed her and fired four shots from a silenced Makarov pistol, one in her heart and three in her head.\n        Police investigators seized all her research materials from her home and her office at Novaya Gazeta, one of the few independent newspapers still functioning in Moscow. We hope they lead to arrests, and not a cover-up. It is hard to be optimistic.\n        The murder of Ms. Politkovskaya -- like the murder last month of Andrei Kozlov, the deputy chairman of the Russian Central Bank who was trying to reform the banking system -- had the stench of a political assassination.

It occupies a privileged position among charities, with its place in the National Response Plan as a partner with the government and with its extremely large share of private giving. So far it has received $1.8 billion of the $2.96 billion donated for hurricane relief and recovery this year. If a sudden catastrophe strikes where you live, wiping out your home and your possessions, you will need the Red Cross. The question is increasingly about how much you can count on it.\n        Marsha Evans, a former rear admiral in the Navy, was brought in to restore the charity's reputation after the Sept. 11 attacks. Now she is leaving in the wake of criticism over the organization's response to Hurricane Katrina. It is the second time in four years that the charity has lost its chief, and the resignation comes at a time when a re-evaluation of the organization's approach to large-scale disasters is sorely needed.\n        A Red Cross spokesman told The Times earlier this week that Ms. Evans's departure had been driven by coordination and communication issues with the board. The board is dominated by the local chapters, whose interests are not always the same as those of the national organization. It is also large and unwieldy. The Red Cross board has a whopping 50 members, 30 of them elected by local and regional offices. The average size of nonprofit boards is 17 members, according to one survey.\n        The Red Cross had trouble dealing with Katrina, an event that was admittedly overwhelming but that had been predicted and studied for some time. Yet in a statement on the Red Cross Web site, the board chairman, Bonnie McElveen-Hunter, writes that ''we anticipate no major changes in strategic direction,'' and that the organization is ''embarked upon the right course.''\n        That suggests that Ms. McElveen-Hunter, if not the entire American Red Cross, is dangerously out of touch at a time when community leaders, nonprofit experts, hurricane victims and even members of Congress have questioned its effectiveness.\n        It's beginning to look as if the Red Cross is more interested in deflecting criticism than in improving its response to emergencies.

A government survey determined that three of the largest drug companies have effectively reneged on their pledges to list trials in a federal database. A report in yesterday's Times by Alex Berenson reveals that this intransigence also extends to a voluntary industry database. It looks as if demands from researchers and the medical profession for full access to clinical trial data will continue to be frustrated.\n        Companies already provide the data to the Food and Drug Administration, which is required to keep much of it confidential. A public listing of trials is important to prevent drug makers from hiding results that reflect badly on their drugs while publishing only results that make their drugs look good. By law, the companies are supposed to register important trials with a government Web site. Most manufacturers are complying, but the three big obfuscators -- Merck, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer -- are often getting around the requirement by not naming the drugs they are testing, instead using phrases like ''an investigational drug.'' Merck was the worst offender, failing to provide a drug's name some 90 percent of the time. Glaxo withheld a name 53 percent of the time, and Pfizer 36 percent of the time.\n        Merck and Pfizer are also the most prominent withholders of trial results from the industry's voluntary database. As Mr. Berenson reported, Pfizer has posted only a few results of clinical trials, and Merck has posted none. That meager contribution appears to satisfy the weak guidelines set by the industry, but it offers a sorry contrast with the record of Eli Lilly. Lilly appears to have been quite scrupulous in listing its current trials with the government site and has posted the results of hundreds of completed clinical trials on the industry site. Surely if one big company can make its trials transparent, other drug makers can do the same.\n        A coalition of medical editors has just stiffened its announcement that leading journals will soon refuse to publish the results of any clinical trial that has not complied with tough international standards for transparency. That should apply useful pressure to recalcitrant companies. But the best hammer would be federal legislation to compel all companies to provide critical information when a trial is begun and full results when a trial is completed, with stiff penalties for noncompliance.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1813367,"ids":1813367,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Anyone looking for new thinking on Iraq, or even candor, had to be disappointed by President Bush's news conference yesterday. Mr. Bush may want to defer unveiling his new strategy, but there will be no obliging pause in Iraq's unraveling.\n        The latest Pentagon status report confirms a spiraling death toll, ever deeper sectarian divisions and near total lawlessness on the streets of Baghdad, despite repeated American vows to secure the capital. In a further sign of Iraq's descent, our colleague James Glanz reported this week that Baghdad gets less than seven hours of electricity a day, as insurgents and looters dismantle the power grid.\n        While Mr. Bush contemplates his fast-disappearing options, competing factions in the administration and the military have been less reticent about floating their ideas. Some urge a sharp, temporary increase in American troop strength in Baghdad. Others argue that Iraqi forces should take the lead, whether or not they're ready. Still others talk about different ways of reconfiguring Iraq's dysfunctional governing coalition.\n        The problem is not so much with the specific proposals -- some deserve serious consideration -- as with the illusion that the political and military components of American policy can be pursued in isolation from each other. That is the kind of made-in-Washington tunnel vision that produced the current disaster. Only a political strategy, embraced by Iraqis themselves and backed by American military muscle, can have even a remote chance of altering events, and even that may be too late.\n        Consider the talk of a temporary escalation of American forces to impose some order in Baghdad. That is guaranteed to fail, unless it is tightly integrated with a political strategy for producing an Iraqi government finally willing to move against Shiite militias and open a dialogue on national reconciliation. Without that, any temporary increase could slide seamlessly into a permanent escalation -- something America's depleted ground forces cannot handle -- with no chance of containing the chaos.\n        And while American diplomats report hints that Iraq's top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, might be willing to support a genuine national unity government, it remains unclear whether he would countenance any loss of power for Shiite fundamentalists -- and whether Washington has any leverage left to influence his decision.\n        Yesterday, Mr. Bush acknowledged the obvious and desperate need to rebuild America's overstretched ground forces, a subject he refrained from talking about so long as Donald Rumsfeld ran the Pentagon. But that will take time and won't be any help in Iraq. Mr. Bush also needs to acknowledge that his course there has reached a dead end.

Four years ago, New York had rancor and racial hostility. This year, after an extremely civil campaign, the city is moving toward a runoff in which the second-place finisher has already endorsed his opponent.\n        Anthony Weiner, the Brooklyn congressman who finished behind Fernando Ferrer in this week's voting, certainly deserves the season's good sportsmanship award. After Mr. Ferrer appeared to have failed to get the 40 percent vote necessary to avoid a runoff -- by the narrowest of margins -- Mr. Weiner issued a rather stirring encomium to Mr. Ferrer's virtues and declared that contesting the nomination any further would be ''a waste.''\n        Mr. Ferrer instantly became the presumptive Democratic nominee. And Mr. Weiner earned a debt of gratitude from all primary-weary New Yorkers, who had spent the last several weeks dodging brochure-wielding campaign workers on the streets and being barraged at home by recorded messages from prominent Democrats.\n        It's still possible that once all the absentee and paper ballots are counted, Mr. Ferrer will have managed to squeak past the 40 percent mark. If not, the question is whether there is any legal way to avoid having the runoff election -- probably none of the legislators who wrote the statute could have imagined that a New York politician could make the cut and then just say, Never mind. A private legal services firm with ties to the Democrats is expected to ask a State Supreme Court judge today to halt the runoff, which the city's Board of Elections says would cost about $10 million to $12 million. Such a runoff would also threaten to restrict voter participation to Mr. Ferrer's immediate family.\n        Although we can think of many better ways to spend $10 million or so, nobody in New York City should feel comfortable setting a precedent in which the Board of Elections, which is made up of local political appointees, is allowed to start ignoring state law. But the courts will have to decide whether the statute does provide for not holding an election when there are no candidates.\n        If the runoff does have to happen, Mr. Ferrer should certainly assure the public that he will not accept the $421,000 in city funds he would be entitled to under the campaign finance system. Although Mr. Ferrer will be running this fall against Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire incumbent, it would be a terrible first step for his campaign to take hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayers' money for an election in which he is the only candidate.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":5,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1643180,"ids":1643180,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Anyone who watched the delicate rinse cycle applied to Condoleezza Rice by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday, despite a jab here and there, could be forgiven for thinking that the future secretary of state was a newcomer to the Bush administration. With a few exceptions, the hearing was political theater. Ms. Rice acted as if things were going according to plan in Iraq and everywhere else, and the senators acted as if she were not part of the serial disasters of the administration's foreign policy.\n        President Bush is entitled to choose his cabinet, and there was never much chance of opposition to Ms. Rice, a trusted member of his inner circle. But confirmation hearings should critically examine the nominee. Another unfortunate choice for a top job, Alberto Gonzales, at least had to endure a few hours' grilling on the torture of prisoners on his way to becoming attorney general.\n        Yesterday, Democratic senators, and some Republicans, recited the flaws in Mr. Bush's foreign policies -- most glaringly on Iraq -- and then did little more than politely urge Ms. Rice to check into those things once she's confirmed.\n        Senator Joseph Biden, Democrat of Delaware, asked Ms. Rice how big an Iraqi security force had actually been trained. When Ms. Rice, the national security adviser, offered an absurdly inflated 120,000, Mr. Biden said the people doing the training put the total at 4,000. He then suggested that Ms. Rice ''pick up the phone or go see these folks,'' as if that has not been her job all along, especially in the year since the administration said that all information on operations in Iraq would flow through her.\n        Ms. Rice has been an enthusiastic supporter of dismantling international treaties and organizations from the start of Mr. Bush's presidency. The bipartisan panel on the 9\/11 attacks and other accounts chillingly exposed her early disregard for the threat of terrorism. And she was so much the public face of the drive to war with Iraq that her appearances on Sunday morning talk shows became a running joke.\n        That history was barely mentioned yesterday, except when Senator Barbara Boxer reminded Ms. Rice of her apocalyptic remarks about nonexistent Iraqi nuclear weapons and suggested that ''your loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell this war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth.''\n        Ms. Rice said repeatedly that she intended to engage in ''public diplomacy.'' We hope that doesn't mean trying to sell flawed American foreign policy to reluctant governments abroad. Colin Powell couldn't manage that, and he is a more adept pitchman than Ms. Rice. What the country needs is not better spin, but a secretary of state who can recognize what has gone wrong and use her access to the president to help steer a more rational course.\n        Some of Ms. Rice's early moves were good. She did not choose as her deputy John Bolton, the under secretary whose confrontational approach thwarted a negotiated end to the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs. Instead, her deputy will be Robert Zoellick, who has a long record in the diplomacy of trade.\n        But yesterday's hearing did not provide more cause for optimism.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1781166,"ids":1781166,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"As America's military experience in Iraq grows ever more nightmarish, it is becoming clear that President Bush's strategy comes down to this: Keep holding to a failing course for the next 29 months and leave it to the next administration to clean up the mess.\n        That abdication of responsibility cannot be allowed to continue at the expense of American lives, military readiness and international influence. With the Republican majority in Congress moving in perpetual lock step behind the White House, the job of pressing the issue has been dumped in the laps of the Democrats. Unfortunately, they have their own version of reality avoidance. It involves pretending that the nightmare can be ended by adopting a timetable for a phased withdrawal of American troops.\n        Mr. Bush's cheerleading encourages the illusion that it is just a matter of time and American support before Iraq evolves into a stable democracy. The Democratic timetable spins a different fantasy: that if the Iraqis are told that American troops will be leaving in stages, at specific dates, their government will rise to the occasion and create its own security forces to maintain order.\n        The Iraqi government has not failed to develop adequate police and military forces of its own because it lacks the incentive. It has failed to do so because it is weak and divided, because its people are frightened and because the strongest leaders in the country are the men who control sectarian militias. A phased withdrawal by itself would simply leave the American soldiers who remain behind in graver danger, and hasten what looks like an inevitable descent into civil war.\n        Democrats are embracing the withdrawal option because it sounds good on the surface and allows them to avoid a more far-reaching discussion that might expose their party's own foreign policy divisions. Most of all, they want an election-year position that maximizes the president's weakness without exposing their candidates to criticism. But they are doing nothing to help the public understand the grim options we face.\n        The only responsible way out of Iraq involves all the things President Bush refused to consider on the way in. That means enlisting help from some of the same Arab neighbors and European allies whose opinions and suggestions were scornfully ignored before the invasion. Getting their assistance would be a humbling experience. Americans may feel the war is going badly, but they have not been prepared to acknowledge failure.\n        America's allies have an interest in not seeing Iraq turn into a hive of terrorists and a font of regional instability. However, before other nations become involved they would certainly insist on a laundry list of American concessions, from a share in war-related business for their contractors to an all-out United States push for a renewed peace process among Israel, the Palestinians and their neighbors.\n        A serious plan for disengagement from Iraq is not well tailored to the campaign trail. Real withdrawal will be messy and unpleasant. Even under the best of circumstances, it could well end in disaster.

The case involved Georgia Thompson, a state employee sent to prison on the flimsiest of corruption charges just as her boss, a Democrat, was fighting off a Republican challenger. It just might shed some light on a question that lurks behind the firing of eight top federal prosecutors: what did the surviving attorneys do to escape the axe?\n        Ms. Thompson, a purchasing official in the state's Department of Administration, was accused by the United States attorney in Milwaukee, Steven Biskupic, of awarding a travel contract to a company whose chief executive contributed to the campaign of Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat. Ms. Thompson said the decision was made on the merits, but she was convicted and sent to prison before she could appeal.\n        The prosecution was a boon to Mr. Doyle's opponent. Republicans ran a barrage of attack ads that purported to tie Ms. Thompson's ''corruption'' to Mr. Doyle. Ms. Thompson was sentenced shortly before the election, which Governor Doyle won.\n        The Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit seemed shocked by the injustice of her conviction. It took the extraordinary step of releasing Ms. Thompson from prison immediately after hearing arguments, without waiting to issue a ruling. One of the judges hinted that Ms. Thompson may have been railroaded. ''It strikes me that your evidence is beyond thin,'' Judge Diane Wood told the lawyer from Mr. Biskupic's office.\n        Ms. Thompson's case is not the only one raising questions about whether prosecutors tried last year to tilt close elections toward the Republicans. New Jersey's federal prosecutor conducted an investigation of weak-looking allegations against Senator Robert Menendez that was used in Republican ads.\n        Congress should look into both cases to determine whether partisan politics played a role -- and whether they were coordinated with anyone at the Justice Department or the White House.\n        The list of things to investigate keeps growing. A federal agency that protects the rights of military employees is now investigating the firing of David Iglesias, the New Mexico United States attorney. Justice Department officials said he was fired in part because he was out of the office due to his commitments as a Navy military reservist. If so, the firing may have been illegal.\n        There is also trouble in the Minnesota United States attorney's office, where the administration recently installed Rachel Paulose, a 34-year-old with scant management experience. Three of her top assistants have resigned their management positions, and The St. Paul Pioneer Press reported that they did so out of dissatisfaction with her. Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, said the resignations were more evidence of the attorneys' offices being ''deprofessionalized.''\n        The White House is resisting making Karl Rove, former White House counsel Harriet Miers and other top officials available to Congress. Mr. Schumer proposed last week that their testimony could, at least as a first step, be taken in private, but with a transcript. Clearly, he made the offer to move the investigation forward. But any agreement to conduct such interviews should make it clear that they would be followed by open testimony before Congress. The integrity of the Justice Department is a matter of overriding importance. Voters should be able to see and hear the testimony for themselves.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":18,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1844841,"ids":1844841,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As Democrats in Congress and the Bush administration look for common ground on a workable trade policy, it is worth taking a harder look at the capricious system of tariffs that raise the price of goods and are all too often based on outdated political considerations that defy logic and good sense.\n        Take the article in The Times by Michael Barbaro that detailed the disparities in the fees levied on imported apparel. There is an 8.5 percent duty on an imported wool suit for a woman, but none for a man's, a 10 percent duty on women's hiking boots and an 8.5 percent levy on men's. A vast majority of these tariffs go back to 1930, preserved in round after round of trade-liberalization talks by politicians who won exemptions for their most favored constituents. The reasons for many of them are as forgotten as the factories they were meant to protect.\n        Unfortunately, the costs today are real, and it is often the poorest consumers who are hit the hardest. Some of the highest tariffs are on necessities like clothes, shoes, food and household goods -- simple but labor-intensive industries where the United States is less competitive -- and they act as a regressive tax system, disproportionately affecting those who spend most of their incomes on the basics.\n        There's a similar effect abroad. The Progressive Policy Institute, a Democratic research group, found that the American tariff system is ''uniquely tough'' on poor countries in Asia and the Muslim world that produce labor-intensive goods. It said the United States imported $2.2 billion worth of goods from Cambodia last year and goods totaling $36.8 billion from France. Both paid $367 million in duties.\n        The current series of global trade talks, begun just months after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was supposed to address the gross inequities in the international trade system in hopes of heading off the hopelessness that helps add to terrorists' ranks. Shamefully, the talks have stalled as the interests of a small number of heavily subsidized and protected farmers in rich countries have again taken precedence.\n        President Bush needs to make a concerted push to revive this crucial economic front, making sure that it lives up to the ideal of economic development for the most disadvantaged. Mr. Bush and Congress must also look at ways to fix the outdated system of tariffs that punish American interests at home and overseas.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1773216,"ids":1773216,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As Gov. Jon Corzine and some of his fellow Democrats in the Assembly stared down a July 1 deadline to pass a new budget, a startling bit of news broke through the bombast and gamesmanship: poor children in New Jersey are worse off today than they were six years ago.\n        The number of children living below the poverty rate in New Jersey is up by an astonishing 20 percent since 2000, according to a survey by the Baltimore-based Annie E. Casey Foundation. Twelve percent of the state's children were living in poverty as of 2004, the last year for which figures are available. The figure was 10 percent in 2000.\n        Meanwhile, the number of unemployed parents with minor children increased by 8 percent over the same time period.\n        The foundation's study, based on census records, is a sobering reminder that poverty has not been abolished even as New Jersey's median family income climbed in recent years to its current level of about $75,000.\n        While this may seem obvious, the recent deliberations in Trenton offered little to suggest that lawmakers are aware of the presence of poor people and their children in the midst of New Jersey's plenty. Many of the objections to Mr. Corzine's proposed sales tax increase, from 6 percent to 7 percent, were based on political calculations -- Assembly Democrats did not want to be tagged as tax-raisers -- rather than concern for the tax's regressive impact on the poor.\n        New Jersey is paying the price for shoddy fiscal schemes and monumental inefficiencies during the last decade, and may do so for years to come. But as this year's budget talks showed, the true cost of waste, corruption and folly can be measured not just in dollars but in lives made harder, in struggles made more burdensome.\n        When Governor Corzine unveiled his budget in March, he included a provision to ease the plight of the state's poor even as he struggled to close a $4.5 billion budget gap. Some 414,000 households with annual incomes less than $25,000 would have seen their state tax liability disappear. Married taxpayers earning $30,000 or less, and single people earning $20,000 or less, would have received a tax cut. The governor's budget document referred to this proposal, which would have cost the state $105 million a year, as a ''signature initiative.''\n        But signature initiatives have a way of becoming disposable when budget talks begin to resemble wrestling matches. Mr. Corzine has decided to postpone the tax-relief plan until next year in an effort to save $105 million this year. While his intentions seem sincere, there are no guarantees the poor will see relief in 2007 -- the budget forecast for next year is grim, too.\n        And so, at a time when property tax reduction is all the rage, a tax cut for the poor fell by the wayside as New Jersey's politicians tried to scramble out of a mess years in the making.\n        Surely this is nobody's idea of shared sacrifice.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1849004,"ids":1849004,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As Monica Goodling, a key player in the United States attorney scandal, prepares to testify before Congress on Wednesday, the administration's strategy is clear. It has offered up implausible excuses, hidden the most damaging evidence and feigned memory lapses, while hoping that the public's attention moves on. But this scandal is too important for the public or Congress to move on. This story should not end until Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is gone, and the serious damage that has been done to the Justice Department is repaired.\n        The Justice Department is no ordinary agency. Its 93 United States attorney offices, scattered across the country, prosecute federal crimes ranging from public corruption to terrorism. These prosecutors have enormous power: they can wiretap people's homes, seize property and put people in jail for life. They can destroy businesses, and affect the outcomes of elections. It has always been understood that although they are appointed by a president, usually from his own party, once in office they must operate in a nonpartisan way, and be insulated from outside pressures.\n        This understanding has badly broken down. It is now clear that United States attorneys were pressured to act in the interests of the Republican Party, and lost their job if they failed to do so. The firing offenses of the nine prosecutors who were purged last year were that they would not indict Democrats, they investigated important Republicans, or they would not try to suppress the votes of Democratic-leaning groups with baseless election fraud cases.\n        The degree of partisanship in the department is shocking. A study by two professors, Donald Shields of the University of Missouri at St. Louis and John Cragan of Illinois State University, found that the Bush Justice Department has investigated Democratic officeholders and office seekers about four times as often as Republican ones.\n        It is hard not to see the fingerprints of Karl Rove. A disproportionate number of the prosecutors pushed out, or considered for dismissal, were in swing states. The main reason for the purge -- apart from hobbling a California investigation that has already put one Republican congressman in jail -- appears to have been an attempt to tip states like Missouri and Washington to Republican candidates for House, Senate, governor and president.\n        Justice Department headquarters has become deeply partisan. Young operatives like Ms. Goodling were apparently allowed to hire and promote based on party membership. Political appointees cleared the way for laws designed to disenfranchise minority voters, and brought litigation to remove Democratic-leaning voters from the rolls.\n        The department's integrity lies in tatters. As a result of the purge, Tim Griffin, a Republican operative and Karl Rove prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was installed as the top federal prosecutor in eastern Arkansas. Rachel Paulose, a 33-year-old Republican activist with thin prosecutorial experience, was assigned to Minnesota. If either indicted a prominent Democrat tomorrow, everyone would believe it was a political hit.\n        Congress has to save the Justice Department, something President Bush shows no interest in doing. It should pass a resolution of ''no confidence'' in Mr. Gonzales, and push for his removal. But it also needs to insist on new leadership that will restore the department's traditions of professionalism and impartiality, and re-establish that in the United States, the legal system does not work to advance the interests of a political party.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1835834,"ids":1835834,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice moves into the final days of her Middle East trip, she still needs to come up with a way to translate the current lull in the violence between Israel and the Palestinians into an opening for genuine peace negotiations.\n        Nobody pretends that will be easy. Hamas -- which has now formed a unity government of convenience with the more moderate Fatah -- still refuses to take the three steps needed to demonstrate its commitment to good-faith diplomacy: renouncing terrorism, recognizing Israel and adhering to previously negotiated agreements. And until it does, Israel refuses to negotiate with Hamas or conduct serious business with the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, of Fatah.\n        Standing back and waiting for more promising conditions is not an option -- and never has been. After six wasted years of Bush administration posturing, Ms. Rice appears, belatedly, to realize that a just, negotiated peace between Israel and the Palestinians is essential for Israeli security and American diplomacy. But recognizing it is not enough. If serious negotiations are to begin any time soon, Washington has to help jump-start the process.\n        That will require Ms. Rice to be willing to talk to any Palestinian genuinely willing to discuss peace -- no matter Israel's objections. Ms. Rice's clear message to all Palestinians -- those in the room and those outside it -- needs to be that if their new government is ready to stop all terrorist attacks against Israel, Ms. Rice is ready to press Israel to take matching steps, like halting all settlement construction and easing onerous restrictions on movements within the West Bank that have throttled economic development and stoked almost universal anger among ordinary Palestinians.\n        If Hamas wants American aid restored, it still must meet the three conditions on ending terrorism, recognizing Israel and accepting past agreements. European governments should hold that line as well. That still leaves room for humanitarian aid delivered through nongovernmental channels, which should continue as needed.\n        And it also leaves room for funneling Western aid to government departments independent of Hamas, like Mr. Abbas's presidential security forces. That practice could be extended to those ministries not controlled by Hamas, provided the aid is kept insulated from other government accounts.\n        Selective assistance can be used to reward well-run ministries that steer a responsible political course. Otherwise, there is a risk that the Palestinian government will become ever more dependent on non-Western sources, like Iran and Saudi Arabia. That would further dilute America's already diminished influence in the region.\n        Ms. Rice's ultimate diplomatic goal must be to resume bilateral negotiations on trading land for peace to create a Palestinian state committed to live alongside Israel. That end result is also envisioned in a 2002 Saudi peace proposal that King Abdullah hopes to revive at an Arab League summit meeting in Riyadh later this week\n        As events five years ago made tragically clear, the renewed Saudi initiative will not get anywhere unless Hamas renounces terrorism and the Palestinian leadership moves aggressively to stop terrorists. Just as an Arab League summit meeting was adopting the initial version of the Saudi plan, Hamas blew up a hotel filled with Israeli civilians celebrating the Passover holiday. That effectively ended the initiative. Ms. Rice's biggest challenge will be moving beyond that sterile cycle of diplomacy and terror. She clearly has her work cut out for her.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1769942,"ids":1769942,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"As a union ironworker with a pro-labor voting record, State Senator Stephen Sweeney, a Democrat from Gloucester County, has impeccable union credentials. But to some of his union brothers and sisters, Stephen Sweeney is the enemy. His crime? He insists that the state must drastically change pension and health benefit packages for future workers, and he thinks union leaders ought to be doing more to help the state out of its current fiscal mess.\n        As the July 1 deadline for passing a new budget approaches, Senator Sweeney finds himself in the center of a growing debate over New Jersey's ability to pay for generous benefits granted by contract to its thousands of unionized workers. He wants to save $700 million in the next fiscal year by cutting state compensation costs by 15 percent. Compensation for state workers accounts for $4.6 billion of the state's $31 billion budget.\n        Among the perks that Mr. Sweeney and his allies, Democratic Assemblymen Jerry Green and Paul Moriarty, have criticized are a 35-hour work week, 14 paid holidays and three personal days annually, 15 paid sick days per year, up to five weeks' vacation for senior workers, and the ability to cash in unused sick time upon retirement at age 55.\n        Mr. Sweeney would increase the work week by five hours, raise the retirement age to 60, change the formula on which pensions are based, and limit lifetime health benefits to the workers, not their dependents.\n        Union leaders point out that benefits are subject to contract negotiations, which are not due to start until next year. Mr. Sweeney replies that when New York City and Philadelphia were in fiscal distress, unions did not stand on ceremony. Labor leaders had a place at the table in both cases, and offered to absorb a share of the pain in the name of fiscal stability and solidarity with other taxpayers.\n        Mr. Sweeney also notes that the entire State Legislature is up for re-election next year, which means that any discussion of union givebacks or concessions must begin now. ''Otherwise,'' he said, ''the same shenanigans that got us into trouble in the first place will happen again.''\n        Over the long term, Mr. Sweeney believes the state must install a two-tier system of retirement and health-care benefits. Current workers will not see a change in their defined benefits. But newly hired workers would have higher co-payments for medical benefits and higher contributions into a reformed pension system.\n        Mr. Sweeney and his colleagues have begun an extremely important debate at an appropriate time.

At this point, only the outlines are known of the latest megadeal arranged yesterday by state leaders in the last hours of the legislative session. It is a huge, complex package that would bring this year's budget up to at least $113 billion. The add-ons are expected to make almost everybody happy except, of course, those who are concerned about the state's fiscal well-being.\n        The biggest giveaway was the $1.65 billion in rebates to property owners statewide over the next two years. The checks will range from a meager $58 to some taxpayers in New York City to more than $600 for some Westchester County taxpayers over 65. The first checks will arrive, pointedly, right before the fall elections. It's fair to assume that the celebratory notes that accompany them will not mention their effect on future deficits.\n        Many of the brave cuts made earlier to Medicaid financing by Gov. George Pataki are also being restored. The governor now says that this extra half-billion dollars for nursing homes and health care facilities will be offset by new measures to control Medicaid fraud. These measures create a Medicaid inspector general but, regrettably, fail to provide incentives for citizens who blow the whistle on Medicaid abuses.\n        Besides choosing a new state insect, there were a few other achievements. More than $220 million in crucial environmental funds are back in the budget. This money was hung up as part of the backroom negotiations among the governor, the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver. And lawmakers agreed to drop the statute of limitations on rape and expand DNA testing for those convicted of crimes in the state, including for some misdemeanors.\n        But there was a lot of the usual half-a-loaf posturing -- bills passed with much trumpeting in one house while ignored by the other. Ethics reforms approved in the Assembly failed to make it in the Senate. The Assembly was responsible for doing in a decent law to prohibit human trafficking and another to allow families to manage health issues for an incapacitated loved one.\n        Senator Bruno called it ''a very productive day for the people of New York State.''

When he expresses alarm -- as he has done of late over rising labor costs -- his concern drives policy, as it apparently did yesterday when the Fed's interest rate committee decided to hold rates steady in a bid to dampen inflationary pressures.\n        But of all the reasons Mr. Bernanke might have for fretting about inflation, rising wages should not be one of them. For starters, wage growth is slowing, not rising. True, wages were up three cents an hour last month. But researchers at the Economic Policy Institute who measured wages over three-month periods found that hourly wages slowed from a 4.7 percent annual growth rate for June through August to 3.1 percent for September through November. Working Americans have more to spend lately, but that's not because of any big acceleration in pay; rather, it's because prices have eased, mainly for energy.\n        Taking a broader view, the job market is -- unfortunately -- the last place one would look for signs of overheating in the Bush-era economy. Of the four economic expansions in modern times that have lasted at least five years, the current one has the worst job creation record by far. This year, job growth has averaged just enough to absorb the new job seekers entering the labor force each month.\n        Which leads us back to Mr. Bernanke. Where does his fear about inflationary wage pressures come from? Perhaps the importance of establishing his inflation-fighting credentials is causing him to react strongly to any perceived threats. For instance, if workers took advantage of lower gas prices to spend freely elsewhere, inflation could conceivably break out. But there is not much evidence of that so far.\n        Or maybe Mr. Bernanke is worried that pay raises in relatively strong job fields -- like engineering, law and health care -- will soon be passed on to consumers. Betting that companies will compel consumers, rather than shareholders, to foot the bill for higher salaries could prove to be a safe wager.\n        Another good bet at this point is, sadly, that the economy will continue to downshift in 2007, removing any upward wage pressures that may exist. An economy that has not been good for jobs and wages during its strong growth phase is not likely to become so as it weakens.","adu_anecdote":3,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1774892,"ids":1774892,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As consumer debt in America balloons to previously unimaginable levels, currently $2.2 trillion and growing, the dark underside of abusive debt collection is growing along with it. Legislators and regulators should take further steps to curb the lies, harassment and intimidation coming from out-of-control collectors. At the same time, they should also look at irresponsible lending: giving additional credit cards and high-interest loans to those already deep in the red.\n        Sewell Chan reported in The Times last week that the number of complaints lodged against third-party debt collectors has soared, rising faster than those for any other industry. From 1999 to 2005 the number of complaints received by the Federal Trade Commission increased by a factor of six. Complaints to New York City officials have more than doubled just since 2003. With last year's draconian new bankruptcy law pushing the last resort for the financially desperate farther out of reach, those numbers are only going to rise without stepped-up enforcement.\n        Third-party collectors are not the original lenders -- the banks or credit-card companies that set the original terms with consumers. The collection agencies buy up debt for a fraction of its value and then try their hands at shaking loose payments. Most are law-abiding, and perform a legitimate service. Debts should be settled and someone has to track down deadbeats and absconders who make borrowing more expensive for the rest of us who pay our bills on time. But a growing number of financial bounty hunters can be extremely aggressive, not to mention indiscriminate.\n        According to the commission, some collectors call at all hours of the night, use obscene language, falsely threaten imprisonment or the seizure of property, and even humiliate their victims by contacting family members and employers. They sometimes seek a larger amount than the borrower actually owes -- if indeed it was owed in the first place. Debt collectors have gone after people who have already paid their debts and even those who never had them to begin with. Sometimes that is a result of mistaken identity, but it is also increasingly due to identity theft.\n        Consumers should know that they are not powerless and that they do have rights. Collectors may not call late at night without permission. In most states family members or workplaces may be called only once, and then only to locate the borrower. It is up to the collection agency to furnish written proof that the debt is valid and it cannot bother a borrower in the meantime.\n        If harassment continues, consumers can call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) toll-free. Last year the commission won a judgment of $10.2 million against a company for use of illegal collection tactics.

That figure is almost certainly overstated. Under the proposed reductions, young workers who now earn about $36,000 would face a 16 percent cut; those earning about $58,000 would face a cut of 25 percent, and those earning $90,000, 29 percent. People not yet in the work force would face even larger reductions.\n        Mr. Bush says these cuts would enable the system to continue paying benefits at the current level to the 30 percent of recipients who now make less than $20,000. But fully two-thirds of retirees rely on Social Security for more than half of their income. Moreover, the Bush plan gives the false impression that the wealthiest beneficiaries would bear the most pain. That's not the case. The wealthier one is, the lower the percentage of retirement income coming from Social Security, so even a big cut has little impact. By 2075, an average worker's benefit cut would equal 10 percent of pre-retirement income; a millionaire's reduction would be only 1 percent.\n        Worse, if Mr. Bush succeeded in creating private accounts, these newly proposed cuts would be only the first whack at retirement benefits. Workers who opened private accounts would also see their government benefits reduced by one dollar for every dollar invested -- plus interest, computed at 3 percentage points above inflation. That would occur even if a private account performed miserably. In the end, the Social Security checks would be minimal -- or nonexistent -- for millions of Americans.\n        But Social Security can be strengthened without cuts as blunt and inflexible as the ones Mr. Bush proposes. Let's start by incorporating Americans' longer lives into the formula for Social Security benefits, ending the need for continual increases in the retirement age. To account for the life expectancy of today's average 35-year-old, for example, adjustments could be made now that would reduce the benefit in 2036 by about $300 a year. A chunk of the Social Security shortfall could also be closed by linking life expectancy to income level. The affluent live longer than the poor, and the gap is growing.\n        Politicians also have to face the hard truth about taxes. Raising the payroll tax by a mere three-tenths of a percentage point -- starting 10 years from now and adding tiny increments over the succeeding 20 years -- would be fair and lucrative, without being too steep or too sudden. It would also be fair to raise the cap on wages subject to the Social Security tax to about $150,000 from the current $90,000.\n        President Bush's overall approval rating and his marks for his handling of Social Security have declined since he put privatization at the top of his agenda. The American people are trying to tell him that there are better ways to go. He obviously can't hear them, but we hope Congress can.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1652155,"ids":1652155,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As he stumps for Social Security privatization, President Bush always gets a big round of applause for promising that the money in a private account could be passed on to one's heirs.\n        If those happy clappers only knew the details.\n        Under the president's proposal, when you retired you would not be able to start spending the money in your private account until after you bought an annuity, a financial contract in which you hand over a lump-sum payment and, in return, get a monthly stream of income for life. The upside of buying such an annuity would be that you'd be protected against outliving all of your money. The downside is that even if you died immediately after retirement, the most your heirs would inherit would be the amount that remained in your private account after you had paid for the mandatory annuity. (If you lived longer, of course, you might well need to spend the remainder to supplement the annuity's low monthly payout. )\n        The idea of making the private accounts part of one's estate is particularly appealing to low-and middle-income earners, who may not have all that much to leave to their heirs under normal circumstances. But those are exactly the people who would have to use the largest share of their accounts to buy annuities. The government would require that annuities be large enough to keep recipients above the poverty line for life. The less you had to start with, the less you'd have left over after buying the mandatory annuity.\n        What if you died before you retired? As with many claims Mr. Bush makes about Social Security privatization, the fate of your private account in the event of your untimely death is unclear. But one issue that raises big doubts about whether that money could be inherited is the question of how the trillions of dollars the government would have to borrow to set up a privatized system would be repaid.\n        Under the president's proposal, when you retired, your traditional Social Security retirement benefit would be cut by an amount equal to all the deposits you had made into your private account plus interest. (The interest would be three percentage points higher than the rate of inflation.) The benefit cut would be each person's contribution to repaying the huge debt the Bush administration would take on to ''pay for'' privatization.\n        But if you died before you retired, you would have already used some of that borrowed money to set up the private account and yet would never have made any contribution to repaying the debt. So in that case, how would the government recoup your share of the amount it had borrowed? Well, it could let your share of the debt go unpaid -- in effect bequeathing to your heirs and their fellow citizens ever-higher deficits. Or your spouse could inherit your private account and the benefit cut that went with it. Or the government could take its cut from your private account before the money went to your survivors -- a grab that could wipe out your stash.\n        The White House would hotly deny that the last alternative could happen. Nothing freaks out the Bush administration more than the suggestion that the government would ever tap someone's private account -- even for money that is owed to the government. It doesn't, however, seem too bothered about gutting your traditional benefits. Go figure.","adu_anecdote":15,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1695196,"ids":1695196,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As if the first Justice Sunday weren't disturbing enough, the extreme right produced an angry sequel last Sunday -- another church-based rally railing against judges. It was offensive on many levels, from the inflammatory and inaccurate attacks on ''activist'' judges to the fact that it was held in a tax-exempt church. If the event's speakers ever got control of the legal system, the nation would be in real trouble.\n        Justice Sunday II was held in a Nashville church and was broadcast to other churches nationwide, as was the original Justice Sunday in April. In his remarks, James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, an evangelical organization, demonized the judiciary as ''unelected, unaccountable and arrogant.'' As usual, the speakers declared their disdain for ''activist'' judges.\n        Attacking judicial activism may be good politics, but it is a phony issue. In a recent Op-Ed article in The Times, Paul Gewirtz and Chad Golder showed that the most conservative justices, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, voted to invalidate laws passed by Congress -- a good measure of judicial activism -- far more often than the justices considered most liberal. What the Justice Sunday II speakers object to is not activist judges, but judges who disagree with them.\n        The rally's speakers had some scary, and ludicrous, proposals. Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, questioned the Supreme Court's power to strike down laws passed by Congress if they are not constitutional, a practice that dates to the early days of the Republic. William Donohue, the president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, argued that the Supreme Court should be able to overturn a Congressional enactment only by a unanimous vote. That is a terrible idea, one that would undo the system of checks and balances designed by the founders.\n        The organizers of the two Justice Sundays seem intent on turning the nation's churches into political staging grounds. Americans may tell pollsters that they favor more morality in public life, but we doubt that this is what they have in mind.\n        It is unfortunate that Mr. DeLay attended Justice Sunday II, but the more interesting news is that Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader, did not.\n        Mr. Frist addressed the first Justice Sunday. But organizers say he was not invited this time because of his recent support for stem cell research. Mr. Frist has spent much of his time as majority leader cozying up to the religious right. The fact that he was deemed too moderate to participate this time is encouraging evidence that Justice Sunday II is a long way from representing the nation's mainstream.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1798012,"ids":1798012,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As predicaments go for champions of family values, few can top the embarrassment suffered by Representative Curt Weldon when federal agents raided the home of his daughter, a Washington lobbyist, in search of evidence that the powerful lawmaker helped her with lucrative clients. The grand jury is still out on the investigation, and Mr. Weldon, a Pennsylvania Republican, says he is innocent. But with each fresh scandal, the tattooing of the G.O.P.-run 109th Congress continues in pre-election polls.\n        Voters had no sooner adjusted to the shock of seeing Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida, disgraced from office by his come-ons to Congressional pages than Bob Ney took his turn on the pre-election scandal smorgasbord. Representative Ney, Republican of Ohio, pleaded guilty to being a principal in the quid-pro-quo insiders' market run by Jack Abramoff, the corrupt Republican lobbyist who is cooperating with investigators about his ties to Congress and the White House. Another Republican, former Representative Randy Cunningham of California, is already doing time. He sold his office in steering $70 million in contracts to companies that offered bribes ranging from a Rolls-Royce to a carpet emblazoned ''Global War on Terror.''\n        It should be remembered that Speaker Dennis Hastert, now under fire in the Foley scandal, helped dampen any chance of in-House ethical controls in his failed attempt to save the career of former Majority Leader Tom DeLay, an Abramoff ally who is accused of political money laundering and is awaiting trial. The sight of the ossified ethics committee forced back to life by the Foley scandal is more pathetic than heartening. It's small wonder that lawmakers feel empowered to make ethical stretches -- like Representative John Doolittle's boosting his own family's value by having his wife designated a consultant and paying her a 15 percent commission off the top of his campaign kitty.\n        The hustings ring with Democrats' vows to restore ethical spine. But the minority has its own problem in Representative William Jefferson of Louisiana, who is accused of taking bribe money and hiding it in his home freezer. And Democrats are not helped when their Senate leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, amends his ethics filings to better report a real estate windfall, and misuses campaign money to pay helpers at his Washington condo.\n        The G.O.P. leaders have themselves to blame for their multiple millstones. If they had passed actual ethics reform, instead of deep-sixing it in bromides, there could have been a believable independent corruption office to take some of the heat off their current plight as compromised self-investigators. (One of the defeated reforms would have denied pensions to lawmakers convicted of official abuses. Instead, Messrs. Cunningham and Ney are likely to keep collecting behind bars.)\n        Congressmen caught in wrongdoing at this time of year like to complain that they're the victims of election-eve politics.

From the start, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the New York Jets planned to use the parcel to build a football stadium that would double as convention space and help the city win the 2012 Olympics. Since the construction would be over a state-owned rail yard, controlled by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the deal has bypassed local approval. A hue and cry from civic groups and the City Council made little impact. Even a gap of hundreds of millions of dollars between the asking and the offering prices seemed no impediment. A world-class arbitrator, former Senator George Mitchell, was lined up to seal the deal.\n        That was last week. Now everything is in question, starting with the financing.\n        The city is promising to chip in $300 million to help pay for the stadium's foundation and roof -- money it would raise by diverting payments in lieu of taxes that are now made to New York by hundreds of businesses. That money goes to the city's general fund, and this kind of diversion has been done before only on a very small scale, involving no more than thousands of dollars. There's also the matter of revenue. The Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan city agency, challenged the assertion by Deputy Mayor Daniel Doctoroff that the stadium would generate a government profit of $900 million over 30 years. The actual projected number, the agency said, is about $200 million.\n        But money is only part of the problem. The city can do better than the stadium project.\n        One potential alternative surfaced last weekend with a surprise rival bid from Madison Square Garden, owned by Cablevision, a nemesis of Mr. Bloomberg's. The Garden, which is not eager to see a new large-venue challenger, offered $600 million for rights and a platform for mixed-use development, well more than the Jets' best offer of $100 million for rights and the M.T.A.'s price tag of $300 million. While Mr. Bloomberg ridiculed the offer, the Jets -- who say they are prepared to commit more than $1 billion to the project -- are not laughing.\n        More important, though, may be the reaction of Peter Kalikow, the M.T.A. chairman, who says he wants to give the Garden time to prove its offer is serious. Whatever the final answer, Mr. Kalikow -- not George Mitchell or even the mayor -- is responsible for making sure that the region's troubled transit system gets the maximum profit. Behind Mr. Kalikow stands Gov. George Pataki, who appointed him and is accountable for anything he does.\n        Mr. Kalikow is not obliged to follow the script written by the mayor and other officials obsessed with getting a quick commitment for the stadium to help the city's Olympics bid. Dean Skelos, a Republican state senator from Long Island, suggests that the bidding process be opened. That sounds reasonable, especially since the M.T.A.'s own commissioned appraisal was about $900 million.\n        It's far better than arbitration, which would assume that a Jets deal must be reached. In any case, Mr. Mitchell would not be the right choice, despite his reputation for fairness, because he is chairman of Disney, which owns ABC Sports and ESPN, which broadcast football and may bid on the Olympics. The debate should stay where it is -- in the open.","adu_anecdote":14,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1820352,"ids":1820352,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As targets of suburban loathing and despair, property taxes get all the attention, particularly in Westchester, whose property taxes are among the highest in the nation. But there are many other tributaries flowing into the sea of taxes in which New Yorkers float.\n        The proliferation of taxing districts -- counties, towns, villages, hamlets, fire departments, sewer and sanitary districts -- has left us all in a trap. We love the amenities of multiple governments but ache under the burden of paying for them all. The cost of living here keeps rising in ways that seem beyond anyone's control, since children need the best schooling, and other things like garbage collection and gleaming fire trucks, while expensive, are also seen as essential. Or, if not essential, then at least immovable. In many cases the special taxing districts have become politically tenacious fiefdoms: secretive, highly fortified and resistant to siege.\n        People like to complain about the problem, but it took the Nassau County Comptroller, Howard Weitzman, to sink his watchdog's teeth into it. Last month he issued a report highlighting ways that the more than 200 special taxing districts in Nassau -- whose total tax bill was more than $473 million last year -- could save large amounts of money. Officials in Westchester could learn something from what Mr. Weitzman has to say.\n        Mr. Weitzman says that municipalities can save money without dissolving themselves or consolidating with other districts. These options have often been suggested, most recently by Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who wants to create a Commission on Local Government Efficiency to study the problem across the state, which has more than 4,200 taxing districts. Instead, Mr. Weitzman proposes smart trimming around the edges of the problem by imposing greater oversight and by pooling resources.\n        The first line of defense against special-district overspending -- watchful voters -- is faulty, since special-district elections are obscure rituals in which only the tiniest sliver of the electorate participates. So Mr. Weitzman suggests that town governments step in to control spending. As he interprets state law, towns have the authority to review the budgets of special districts, to compel them to justify expenses and to trim their budgets as needed. Two of Nassau's three towns -- North Hempstead and Oyster Bay -- have already begun doing so.\n        Mr. Weitzman's report outlines common-sense ways districts could band together to reduce insurance costs, pooling their risk through group self-insurance and saving money that would otherwise be spent unnecessarily on brokers' fees and redundant contracts with private companies. The same cooperation could apply to buying goods and services in bulk, or contracting with town governments for services like snow plowing and tree pruning at rates cheaper than those charged by private companies.\n        If there was ever any doubt that special-district spending could be tightened, it was shattered in 2005. That was the year Mr. Weitzman conducted eye-opening audits of sanitary districts in Nassau, finding numerous examples of wastefulness and lack of oversight, and Newsday published a series of articles detailing the sometimes grotesquely lavish spending by volunteer fire districts across Long Island. Mr. Spitzer and municipalities everywhere would do well to take a page, or several, from Mr. Weitzman's report.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1846321,"ids":1846321,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As the United States attorney scandal grows, so does the number of prosecutors who seem to have been pushed out for partisan political reasons. Another highly suspicious case has emerged in the appointment of Bradley Schlozman, a controversial elections lawyer, to replace a respected United States attorney in Missouri. From the facts available, it looks like a main reason for installing Mr. Schlozman was to help Republicans win a pivotal Missouri Senate race.\n        Jim Talent, the Republican incumbent, was facing a strong challenge from Claire McCaskill last year when the United States attorney, Todd Graves, resigned suddenly. Mr. Graves suspects that he may have been pushed out in part because he refused to support a baseless lawsuit against the state of Missouri that could have led to voters' being wrongly removed from the rolls.\n        Mr. Graves was replaced by Mr. Schlozman, a high-level Justice Department lawyer who had made his name in the Bush administration by helping to turn the department away from its historic commitment to protecting the voting rights of minorities. Mr. Schlozman was one of the political appointees who approved Tom DeLay's Texas redistricting plan and Georgia's voter ID law, over the objection of career lawyers on the staff, who insisted that both violated the Voting Rights Act. McClatchy Newspapers reported that Mr. Schlozman also has been accused of hiring Justice Department lawyers based on their political party.\n        Mr. Schlozman injected the United States attorney's office directly into the Talent-McCaskill race. Days before the election, he announced indictments of four people who were registering voters for the liberal group Acorn on charges of submitting false registration forms. The Republicans turned the indictments into an issue in the campaign, although Ms. McCaskill won the election anyway. Congress should investigate whether the indictments violated Justice Department guidelines, which say that election crime investigations should not be conducted right before an election, because they can themselves become a campaign issue.\n        Mr. Schlozman's short stint in Missouri -- he left after about a year -- appears to be another case of the Bush administration's politicizing federal prosecutors' offices. Mr. Graves was reportedly on a list to be fired, and clues are emerging about why. He said this week that when he interviewed for the job, he was asked to name one attribute that describes him. ''I said independent,'' he said. ''Apparently, that was the wrong attribute.''\n        The Senate Judiciary Committee has asked to question Mr. Schlozman, and it should also question Mr. Graves. But Karl Rove and the former White House counsel Harriet Miers, who appear to have been deeply involved in the United States attorney firings, are likely to know the most about what happened, and should be made to testify as well.\n        A single Senate campaign may not seem that important. But Missouri's race was among the nation's closest, and if Mr. Talent had won, the Republicans would have kept their Senate majority. The American people have a right to know whether Mr. Schlozman was sent on his brief assignment in Missouri to pursue justice, or to affect the outcome of an election.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1664810,"ids":1664810,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As the date rapidly approaches for a big meeting where the leaders of the rich world are supposed to come up with a plan to help lift Africa's poor, tired and huddled masses out of poverty, things are starting to get interesting. Last week, Japan announced that it would double its aid to Africa. Granted, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is doing so to better Japan's chances of getting a seat on the United Nations Security Council, according to Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, but so what? Money is money.\n        And after weeks of hinting, Germany publicly announced that it would meet the United Nations target of increasing foreign assistance to poor countries to 0.7 percent of the gross national product by 2015; indeed, the Germans said they could meet the goal by 2014. Germany's United Nations envoy, Gunter Pleuger, said last Thursday that Germany would increase development assistance to 0.35 percent in 2006, 0.5 percent in 2010 and 0.7 percent in 2014.\n        The German announcement makes it clear that Europe is backing the British prime minister, Tony Blair, in his quest to pry money out of rich countries for Africa when the leaders of Group of 7 industrialized nations meet in Gleneagles, Scotland, in July. Mr. Blair has staked his chairmanship of the G-7 this year on a Marshall Plan for Africa, and we are hard-pressed to think of a more worthy goal.\n        The continent is at a crossroads right now, with Africans, after long years of accepting the rule of brutal and corrupt dictators, finally dragging themselves to their feet to stand up and say, ''Enough.'' But there are two paths they can take.\n        With help from the rich world, countries like Ethiopia, Mozambique and Liberia can take the route of development and progress, and finally join the rest of the world in enjoying the things that our generation has come to expect: life, liberty and the ability to get from one day to the next with shoes on your feet and food in your stomach. Without that help, those same countries can take the path that cycles back into civil war, poverty and life expectancies so low that 13-year-old girls are considered old women.\n        Britain announced long ago that it would meet the 0.7 percent target by 2013. France is more than halfway there, at 0.41, and has announced a timetable to get to 0.5 percent by 2007 and 0.7 percent by 2012. From America -- the stingiest of all, compared with the rest of the G-7, donating just 0.18 percent of its gross national product to foreign aid -- there has not been a word about getting to 0.7 percent by any date in this century.

The Kremlin's G-8 partners should be pushing President Vladimir Putin for reform -- for the sake of his country. The long-term health of Russia's economy hinges on its ability to create a fair playing field for investors.\n        Whether the government is confiscating millions of dollars worth of Motorola phones or barring a leading foreign investor from the country, Russia increasingly looks like a risky place to do business. A respect for property rights is essential, but small-business owners are regularly strong-armed into selling out, or have their companies stolen outright. The Times reported earlier this year that a parliamentary panel found more than 1,400 cases of fraudulent business takeovers in 2005 alone.\n        The quick cash won't be worth it in the long run if the international business community decides that the rewards are no longer worth the risks. Nowhere is this more obvious -- and more crucial -- than in the state-controlled energy sector. Mr. Putin has made energy security the central focus of the G-8 meeting, an appropriate theme given today's high prices and Russia's prominence as a supplier of oil and especially natural gas, in which it leads the world in reserves. But Western Europe and Russia have different ideas of what constitutes energy security.\n        Mr. Putin wants stable long-term contracts for the natural-gas monopoly Gazprom, which provides a quarter of Europe's gas. He also wants other countries to allow Gazprom to buy stakes in local distribution and marketing companies. European leaders, however, are still spooked by Russia's cutting off supplies to Ukraine last winter. Mr. Putin cannot use Gazprom to squeeze foreign leaders while expecting them to treat it as a normal business.\n        With energy prices high and money pouring in, it would be easy for the Russians to see themselves in a position of strength and refuse to give ground. But behind the facade of strength are long-term weaknesses. Several of Gazprom's key gas fields are aging; the company had production shortfalls during a cold spell in January. Gazprom needs both outside investment and technological know-how for exploration and extraction.\n        And unlike oil, for which comparable substitutes are difficult to find, the natural gas used for electricity generation can be replaced with coal or nuclear power. If the Russians play hardball too much they may find themselves playing alone, their once-captive customers having fled to safer suppliers.\n        On the other hand, Russia appears close to gaining entry to the World Trade Organization, which the United States has blocked, and if it demonstrates a respect for the rule of law and makes progress in corporate governance, it could earn a free-trade area with the European Union down the road. For the other G-8 leaders, the challenge lies in helping the Russians understand what they need.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1816528,"ids":1816528,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"As the minimum wage moves to the top of the new Congress's agenda, some politicians -- mainly President Bush and Senate Republicans -- seem incapable of viewing the issue as anything other than a pretext for more tax cuts. This time the lucky recipients would be small-business owners, who the politicians contend will be unduly harmed by having to pay higher wages. So much for ringing in the new.\n        It has been more than nine years since the government last increased the federal minimum wage, currently $5.15 an hour. During that period inflation has severely eroded the wage's value. Arguing that it is only fair to cut taxes on business owners when the minimum wage goes up is akin to arguing that taxes should have been raised as the wage fell because of inflation. Instead, as the minimum wage has eroded over the past decade, taxes have been cut sharply.\n        It's even doubtful that the wage increase under discussion -- a $2.10 increase over roughly two years, to $7.25 -- would impair business. Eighty-six percent of small-business owners surveyed by the Wells Fargo\/Gallup Small Business Index said the minimum wage had no effect on their businesses.\n        There's also no reason to believe that the proposed tax cuts would be aimed at employers of low-wage workers. In 2006, when Congress tried to link the minimum wage to tax cuts, the proposals included an estate-tax cut for America's wealthiest families. One proposal now being considered would allow small businesses to write off a larger part of their attorney fees when they go to court to challenge federal regulations. It sounds like a stretch to us that typical employers of minimum-wage workers -- say, restaurants and small factories -- are in any great need of relief from the high cost of federal litigation.\n        And then there's the probability that tax cuts would cost the government far more than a wage increase would ever cost employers, driving up the budget deficit. The Economic Policy Institute analyzed the tax cuts that were linked to an unsuccessful attempt to raise the minimum wage in 2000. Those cuts would have cost $123 billion over 10 years, versus $11.2 billion for the wage increase.\n        It's that sort of idiocy the new Congress was elected to stop.

Instead, the special commission charged with recommending revisions to the Model Code of Judicial Conduct of the American Bar Association has been flip-flopping around on some of the most important aspects of the code, which the states use to set standards for their courts.\n        For decades, the code's overarching charge to judges has been to avoid not only actual impropriety, but also the appearance of impropriety. Recently, however, quietly adopted changes to the commission's ''final'' report demoted this gold standard of judicial conduct from an enforceable rule to a mere aspirational guideline.\n        When the misguided switch came to light, the panel reversed field again yesterday and went back to the previous formulation. But that does not excuse the fact that the panel was following internal politics, not sound legal principle. The change might have eluded pubic attention if Robert Tembeckjian, the administrator of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct, had not protested and Adam Liptak had not reported on the matter in The Times this week.\n        Mark Harrison, chairman of the flailing ethics panel, claimed just days ago that the ''appearance of impropriety'' standard was vague and unfair. But judges interpret rules like that all the time, and the Conference of Chief Justices, made up of top state judges, unanimously endorsed the appearance of impropriety as a basis for disciplinary enforcement.\n        Despite yesterday's news, the proposed code revisions have serious deficiencies. They fall well short of ending the festering scandal of expense-paid judicial seminars that are held at desirable resorts and underwritten by private interests . If the House of Delegates lacks the resolve to ban these junkets, it should at least limit reimbursements for accompanying spouses. There should be no free rides or free lunches (or breakfasts or dinners).\n        The rules on when a judge must bow out of hearing cases also need work. At the federal level, judges must recuse themselves when they have any financial interest raising a potential conflict. That is far preferable to the model code's approach of letting state judges decide for themselves whether their financial conflict is minimal enough to stay on a case.\n        There is a real danger in relying on this commission's judgment. Members of the A.B.A.'s House of Delegates are supposed to vote on the new code next week in Miami. Their wisest course would be to defer the issue, at least until the group's next meeting in August. In the meantime, the president of the bar should appoint an independent committee of experts to review all of the provisions and make their own assessment of what is really needed.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1642337,"ids":1642337,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"At a time when American politics sometimes seems polarized to the point of paralysis, two men who could end up running against each other for governor of New York found common cause this week on an issue of importance to all Americans: clean air.\n        At a joint news conference in Albany, Gov.

This is deeply unfair and it must be corrected.\n        Contract negotiations between City Hall and the union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, have been stalemated for nearly a year, with the city asking for arbitration. Each side whines that the other is at fault for not coming to the table. Enough. It's time for a plan to finally fix police pay before the city pays a higher price from falling morale and force strength.\n        This is how bad the situation is: Recruits are paid at a ridiculous annual rate of $25,100, hardly enough to survive six months of training. These men and women are expected to be well educated (with at least 2 years of college), and to pay for their own gun, a safe to stash it in, and a $500 graduation uniform. Recruits who don't drop out often accumulate heavy debt; recruitment, meanwhile, is so far below targets that the force finds itself short by hundreds of officers of its budgeted goal of nearly 38,000.\n        The issue goes beyond entry pay. After five and a half years, base pay tops out at $59,588, well below the $80,000 average in major cities. Even with overtime and other perks, which the city says can boost pay to $84,000, the compensation is usually too little to support a family in the city, so New York's force includes many suburbanites. After a while, some officers decide to take their training and experience to places like Suffolk County, where the top base pay is $94,000. The benefits are twofold: more money, and no commute.\n        On the plus side, New York's cops can count on generous pensions. But pension benefits are not dramatically out of line with higher-paid forces. What's out of line is the basic pay.\n        Mayor Michael Bloomberg is not a villain here. The city has moved under his leadership from debt to a surplus this year of more than $4.4 billion. He has been prudent in negotiating city labor contracts, holding firm to pattern bargaining, which keeps workers in different fields on the same trajectory. But now the city must concede that more has been asked of the police than has been given.\n        Pattern bargaining may make it difficult for Mr. Bloomberg to be much more generous in this round of bargaining than he was with the firefighters, who recently got a 24-month, 8 percent raise in return for lower night pay differentials and a reduced number of holidays. But City Hall needs to explore creative options, including perhaps a longer term contract that would provide for out-year raises. The union, for its part, needs to persuade its members to agree to productivity increases that can help make larger raises palatable.\n        Much of the city's extraordinary good fortune has come from taxes on real estate and tourism, sectors that remains hot because New York has become attractive as a place to live, work and visit. For that, the city owes something to its police force. In Mr. Bloomberg's previous, corporate world, a great performance would merit an increase. New York cops deserve one, at last.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1832496,"ids":1832496,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"At a time when the nation is pondering how to provide medical coverage to some 47 million uninsured Americans, it is logical and right to start with the country's nine million uninsured children. The Bush administration, unfortunately, is going in exactly the opposite direction.\n        In a shortsighted effort to save money and promote its free-market philosophy, it has proposed reducing the federal contribution to a highly successful children's health insurance program operated by the states. Democratic leaders in Congress are planning to respond with bold, and necessary, proposals to cover a large chunk of the nine million uninsured children -- at a cost that could reach $50 billion to $60 billion over five years.\n        That price tag might seem staggering when health care costs are already spiraling out of control, but less so when one considers that the administration is pouring $200 billion a year into a losing war in Iraq. Just eliminating the large overpayments granted to private health plans that participate in Medicare would save $65 billion over five years. According to a recent New York Times\/CBS News poll a majority of Americans believe that the federal government should guarantee health insurance to all Americans, especially children, and are willing to pay higher taxes to finance it.\n        The issue is coming to a head because the highly successful State Children's Health Insurance Program, or S-Chip, is up for reauthorization. The program is a joint federal-state effort to cover children whose family income is too high to qualify for Medicaid -- the primary federal-state program to cover the poor -- but too low to pay for private coverage.\n        States vary widely in how they handle S-Chip. Many programs cover children in families earning well above the federal poverty level, and sometimes coverage is provided for parents or other adults. Now the Bush administration wants to focus primarily on children from families earning no more than twice the poverty level, or $41,300 for a family of four, while reducing the federal matching rate for everyone else. (A typical family policy can easily cost more than $10,000 a year.) The states would have to take up the slack or watch an estimated 400,000 children -- some predict many more than that -- fall off the rolls.\n        What Americans want and what the country needs is to protect more -- not fewer -- children. Congressional Democrats propose to do that using both S-Chip and the far larger Medicaid program. Some six million of the nine million uninsured children are actually eligible for one program or the other but are not enrolled, because their families either do not know they are eligible or are discouraged by a complicated bureaucratic process. All efforts should be made to enroll them.\n        The administration prefers to rely on tax subsidies to encourage more people to buy their own health insurance and is encouraging states to redirect federal funds they already receive for health care to subsidize health insurance for the poor. Medicaid and S-Chip have been remarkably effective in reducing the number of uninsured children while the number of uninsured adults keeps increasing. That is a success worth building on, not diminishing.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1644342,"ids":1644342,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"At a time when the self-appointed guardians of family values have been denouncing television programming for everything from wardrobe malfunctions to SpongeBob's squishiness on gay tolerance, it's interesting that ''American Idol'' seems to be getting a pass. Fox's hugely popular search for the next singing sensation started its fourth season last week with a series of vicious encounters between hopeful but pathetically untalented young people and celebrity judges being paid to make fun of them. While the contests do not feature bare breasts or four-letter words, they send a truly dreadful message to millions of young viewers about the proper way to treat fellow human beings.\n        The high points of the early episodes of the show are the moments in which desperately clueless singers deliver unbearable versions of pop standards in front of judges who either burst into derisive laughter or helpfully advise the would-be idols that they are way too fat, badly dressed, funny looking or simply ''honestly, excruciatingly awful.'' While some of the contestants have the sort of impenetrable self-obsession that seems to invite that kind of treatment, others react in ways that make it clear they are simply weak and vulnerable. The producers seem to feel it's funny to watch a trio of wealthy and famous adults making fun of a simple 16-year-old girl whose only sin was being ''pretty sure I have a good voice'' when she didn't.\n        About 100,000 contestants, all in their teens or 20's, auditioned for ''American Idol,'' and the ones who wound up on national television survived at least two elimination rounds. While Fox said the survivors were chosen to be a good cross section, it is hard to imagine that any of the extremely na\u00efve contestants understood that they were being moved along only because they showed promise for being ridiculous. In the ensuing battle for the ''tickets to Hollywood,'' the viewers are invited to roar while young people who in many cases appear to be poor, of low intelligence or even mildly disturbed, sing enthusiastically and then stand gape-mouthed with shock while their heroes insult them on national television.\n        One of the points of any reality show is to allow the audience to watch as contestants humiliate themselves by screeching at their spouses on a race around the world, by being voted off the island first, or by failing to get a rose from the bachelor or bachelorette whom they have been desperately and publicly wooing. But there is a very wide gap between demonstrating that life is full of hard knocks and embarrassment, and glorying in the abasement of the utterly defenseless.","adu_anecdote":3,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1823728,"ids":1823728,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"At best, the property tax reforms making their way through the New Jersey Legislature are disappointing. Unless Gov. Jon Corzine uses the full power of his office to strengthen them, the state will continue to be plagued by the highest property taxes in the nation.\n        Last week, the Assembly approved the politically popular part of the tax package -- a 20 percent property tax credit for families earning $100,000 or less and smaller amounts for most people earning more -- and the Senate is likely to pass it this week. But the politically unpopular parts of the package -- those aimed at sustaining property tax stability over the long run -- have either been watered down or lack sufficient support to pass.\n        There were two items Mr. Corzine insisted on before he would sign a tax credit bill. One would cap annual property tax increases at 4 percent (thus imposing real restraints on local spending), the other would create a state comptroller with powers to investigate financial activity at all levels of local government. The Assembly passed both last week; the Senate has already passed the comptroller bill.\n        But the cap measure would exempt a significant part of a town or school district's expenses -- including those for exceptional rises in health costs and additional students. The comptroller bill, meanwhile, would severely limit the office's power to investigate and audit local government, including land deals, where a lot of corruption has occurred.\n        In a pleasant surprise, the Assembly last week passed a bill to bar future state legislators from simultaneously holding other elective or appointed positions, such as mayor or member of the local school board. Unfortunately, the Senate may not act on it. Dual office holding poses a clear conflict of interest for the simple reason that legislators are not likely to support measures to cut state financing for the towns or school districts where they hold office.\n        The list of compromised reforms goes on. At one point, senators and Assembly members seemed ready to pass measures cutting health and pension benefits for future teachers and other government employees, but Mr. Corzine took the legislators off the hook by saying he wanted to negotiate those potentially big cost savings with the employee unions.\n        In short, the special interests, including the self-interests of the legislators themselves, are undermining reform at everyone else's expense.\n        But there is still hope. Mr. Corzine can -- and should -- refuse to sign into law the tax credits, which legislators believe will help them win re-election this fall, unless the Legislature eliminates the worst loopholes in the local property tax caps and the comptroller bill. He can insist that bills like the ban on dual office holding be passed. Last week, Mr. Corzine promised a ''line-by-line'' review of the bills sent to him; he should live up to that and push for improvements.\n        To his credit, Mr. Corzine has been the first governor in years to commit himself to achieving real and lasting property tax reform. If he does not hold firm to his goal, property taxes in New Jersey may never be stabilized.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1798329,"ids":1798329,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"At first glance, the market-beating returns of hedge funds are impressive. But on closer inspection, things look less showy. Performance measures are based on voluntary reporting by hedge funds and thus tend to reflect outperformers rather than laggards and losers. And even some of the winners' outsized returns are overstated because they are not adequately adjusted to reflect the huge risks that go hand in hand with big gains.\n        In addition to those concerns, Jenny Anderson of The Times has now articulated another: the strong possibility that hedge funds' returns are juiced by insider trading.\n        Over the past several years, largely unregulated hedge funds have become a towering presence in the stock market, now accounting for roughly half of all trading on the New York and London exchanges. More recently, they have become major players in the debt market as lenders to companies, buyers of banks loans and investors in tricky derivative securities tied to companies' credit quality.\n        The loan market is far larger than the stock market, and as such, of vast importance to the performance of the overall economy -- a fact that on its own should entice regulators to inquire more about hedge funds' potentially destabilizing positions and activities. A more immediate problem is that loan-market participants routinely deal in confidential information, including all of the details a company must divulge to qualify for a loan and frequent -- nonpublic -- financial updates while a loan is outstanding. With virtually no government oversight and generally fewer institutional controls than banks, hedge funds that are active in both equity and debt markets face huge temptations to trade on insider information.\n        Ms. Anderson reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into whether certain hedge funds improperly traded the shares of Movie Gallery, a movie rental chain, after taking part in a confidential conference call for the company's lenders. Such an investigation may be just the tip of an iceberg. Even if it doesn't uncover any wrongdoing, it has opened a window on how information travels on Wall Street.\n        On Monday, Senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. and several other administration officials and members of Congress, soliciting views on how Congress could improve hedge fund transparency. The replies will, at the least, create a record of officials' ability and willingness to respond to the obvious problems posed by hedge funds -- before those problems become crises.\n        It is time for Congress and federal regulators to take an unflinching look at how deals really get done in today's markets, and to come up with enforceable rules and laws to ensure market integrity and the overall soundness of the financial system.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1639855,"ids":1639855,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"At his 11th State of the State address yesterday, Gov. George Pataki presented himself as New York's No. 1 reformer. His wish list for the new year sounds astonishingly like our own wish list -- lobbying reform to cover state contracts, authorities reform, campaign finance reform, budget reform, a ban on gifts from lobbyists, better rules for the Legislature. It is an impressive lineup, and it would be even more impressive if Mr. Pataki had started pursuing these goals in earnest when he first took office 10 years ago.\n        It's not the first time Mr. Pataki has reinvented himself as a champion of fixing Albany. As catalogued in The Times this week by Michael Cooper, the governor's first State of the State address 10 years ago was a pledge to junk Albany's musty, closed-door system. He wanted accountability and openness. He wanted campaign finance reform. He wanted on-time budgets. He even wanted a limit of two terms for governors. Yet here we are a decade later -- stuck with the same three leaders in a back room running the show. Mr. Pataki is into his third term and not ruling out a fourth. And his office complex is now so unapproachable for press and public alike that it is known in the State Capitol as ''Fort Pataki.'' When he proposed ideas for campaign finance reform and lobbying reform, they were typically delivered to the Legislature too late to produce anything but a fancy press release.\n        In the meantime, other elected officials have gotten way ahead of the governor when it comes to the reform bandwagon. State Comptroller Alan Hevesi has made progress toward opening up the secret subculture of authorities, those public-private entities that have become a huge phantom government in New York. The Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, has led the way in advocating lobbying reform in state agencies and repeatedly pushed for improving the state's budgeting process.\n        It is clear from Mr. Pataki's record in other areas that he can get a lot done if he puts his mind to it. A committed environmentalist, he has pushed for advances in air, water and land preservation in this state. With 9\/11 occurring on his watch, the governor has managed a nest of egos and passions to establish the foundations for a compelling monument in Lower Manhattan.\n        It is still not too late for Mr. Pataki to use some of his energy on those reformist ideals he first described so enthusiastically 10 years ago. Even if these are his last two years on the second floor of the Capitol, he can make a real difference for the future of New York's government. He can twist arms in the Legislature now to change rules next week -- to stop phantom voting, to give committee chairmen more power, to establish a basic staff allotment for every member, to promote real conference committees.\n        Mr. Pataki's political future is a source of earnest debate among Republicans, some of whom even mention his name as a possible presidential candidate in 2008. To be a credible candidate, Mr. Pataki will have to show his credentials as a leader in New York. It would help, even late in his stewardship of the state, if he could take on the mantle as Albany's Mr. Reform. Mr. Pataki only needs the will to do more than just talk about it.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":5,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1838098,"ids":1838098,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"At least one of the presidential candidates making the first feverish dash of the 2008 fund-raising derby felt obliged to describe the tastelessness of the race. ''I'm raising obscene amounts of money,'' said Senator Barack Obama, hardly pausing on his way to piling up a first-round total of $25 million.\n        This is already a record-breaking campaign for the sheer volume of money it is generating. It also is setting a new low with a ludicrously premature handicapping of the race based on the ability to raise cash. It is 19 months before the election, and the quarterly fund-raising data were treated this week like the dawning of poll results from Dixville Notch, N.H.\n        All this in a race that is supposed to be a different sort of competition -- if not of ideas, then at least of personalities and positions.\n        This is not just another example of picking a winner before a vote is cast. This year, the political industry is spinning the money before it is spent, ordaining mega-fund-raising as the sine qua non of a credible candidacy. Dispatches heralded ''the winners of the first presidential fund-raising race,'' pronouncing one big $20 million raiser (Mitt Romney) as instantly ''formidable'' and a ''rising force'' in the campaign, while discounting a more familiar aspirant (Senator John McCain) as ''lackluster'' and ''anemic'' for showing at a mere $12.5 million.\n        If only voters' optimism about the nation and the political system could rise in direct proportion to the money stacks.\n        The one thing established by the private fund-raising binge is that the nation needs the alternative of limited public financing as a rational option for seeking the presidency just as much as when it was enacted in response to the Watergate era of big-money corruption. Successive Congresses have failed to update the dollar limitations of the public financing law, inviting private donors to fully regain the upper hand in this presidential sweepstakes.\n        Senator Hillary Clinton, hailed as a Democratic champ with an opening $26 million kitty, did take a moment for an ''if elected'' promise to seek eventual repair of the public financing system. Why not start now by signing on as a co-sponsor of the excellent proposal already in the Senate hopper to upgrade the limits in time for the 2012 election?\n        And why shouldn't all the candidates join Senators Obama and McCain in pledging to go halfway toward sanity by embracing public finance limits in next year's general election, providing both final candidates agree?\n        That would at least suggest a heartbeat still exists for public financing among the money political class.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1744435,"ids":1744435,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"At the rate that President Bush is going, Iran will be a global superpower before too long. For all of the axis-of-evil rhetoric that has come out of the White House, the reality is that the Bush administration has done more to empower Iran than its most ambitious ayatollah could have dared to imagine. Tehran will be able to look back at the Bush years as a golden era full of boosts from America, its unlikely ally.\n        During the period before the Iraq invasion, the president gave lip service to the idea that Iran and Iraq were both threats to American security. But his advisers, intent on carrying out their long-deferred dream of toppling Saddam Hussein, gave scant thought to what might happen if their plans did not lead to the unified, peaceful, pro-Western democracy of their imaginings. The answer, though, is now rather apparent: a squabbling, divided country in which the Shiite majority in the oil-rich south finds much more in common with its fellow Shiites in Iran than with the Sunni Muslims with whom it needs to form an Iraqi government.\n        Washington has now become dangerously dependent on the good will and constructive behavior of Shiite fundamentalist parties that Iran sheltered, aided and armed during the years that Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq. In recent weeks, neither good will nor constructive behavior has been particularly evident, and if Iran chooses to stir up further trouble to deflect diplomatic pressures on its nuclear program, it could easily do so.\n        There is now a real risk that Iraq, instead of being turned into an outpost of secular democracy challenging the fanatical rulers of the Islamic republic to its east, could become an Iranian-aligned fundamentalist theocracy, challenging the secular Arab regimes to its west.\n        Fast-forward to Thursday's nuclear deal with India, in which President Bush agreed to share civilian nuclear technology with India despite its nuclear weapons programs and its refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\n        This would be a bad idea at any time, rewarding India for flouting the basic international understanding that has successfully discouraged other countries from South Korea to Saudi Arabia from embarking on their own efforts to build nuclear weapons. But it also undermines attempts to rein in Iran, whose nuclear program is progressing fast and unnerving both its neighbors and the West.\n        The India deal is exactly the wrong message to send right now, just days before Washington and its European allies will be asking the International Atomic Energy Agency to refer Iran's case to the United Nations Security Council for further action. Iran's hopes of preventing this depend on convincing the rest of the world that the West is guilty of a double standard on nuclear issues. Mr. Bush might as well have tied a pretty red bow around his India nuclear deal and mailed it as a gift to Tehran.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1808080,"ids":1808080,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"At this point it is hard to tell who is more out of touch: President Bush, who continues to insist that Iraq has not descended into civil war, or Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who appears to believe that Americans will prop him up indefinitely.\n        When the two sit down in Jordan, we hope they will use the time -- finally -- to impress on each other the brutal facts of life in their respective capitals.\n        Mr. Bush needs to make clear that Americans' patience has all but run out and that he will start bringing the troops home unless Mr. Maliki moves to rein in sectarian bloodletting and Iraqi troops start shouldering more of the burden. Mr. Maliki needs to make Mr. Bush understand Iraq's full desperation -- and his own desperate political weakness. So long as Baghdad remains in chaos -- and militias are better armed and more motivated than the Iraqi Army -- he has no chance of ending the blood feuds or breaking the cycle of retribution.\n        This sort of truth-telling does not come easily to either man, and at this point there may not be anything that can salvage Iraq. But more denial and drift will only lead to more chaos. The very fact that the meeting is being held in Jordan -- explanations range from concerns about safety in Iraq to the White House's desire to pry Mr. Maliki away from his more unsavory backers -- should leave no doubt about the urgent need for a change in strategy.\n        Mr. Bush needs to start by giving the Iraqi leader a clear deadline for beginning national reconciliation talks, preferably as soon as Mr. Maliki returns to Baghdad. And he should insist that the talks continue until some agreement is reached on protecting minority rights, equitably dividing the country's oil wealth, and demobilizing sectarian militias. Mr. Bush does not need to insult Mr. Maliki by barking out orders. But he does need to make clear that he can hold off demands for an American withdrawal for only so long.\n        Mr. Bush should not be the only demander. Reconciliation talks will go nowhere until Iraqis see evidence that there is at least some hope for a better life. Mr. Maliki needs to give his own deadline to the Americans for launching a truly make-or-break campaign to retake the streets of Baghdad.\n        Mr. Maliki also needs to tell Mr. Bush that the American training of the Iraqi Army is failing, and without a more aggressive program, the army will collapse at the first sign the Americans are leaving. And he must warn that Mr. Bush's insistence on talking only to friends won't halt meddling by Iran and Syria.\n        King Abdullah II of Jordan, who will play host to the meetings, is warning that unless something drastic happens soon, the Middle East will face three full-blown civil wars: in the Palestinian territories, Lebanon and Iraq. If Iraq's desperate reality is not enough to inspire Mr. Bush and Mr. Maliki to tell each other the truth, perhaps a look into that wider abyss will.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1746264,"ids":1746264,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Authorities in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh set Jagjivan Ram Yadav free the other day. Mr. Yadav was arrested in 1968 on charges of killing his neighbor's wife. But the court system lost his file and he spent 38 years awaiting a trial that would never come. Finally, some journalists learned of his case and, over the protests of a local judge, the Indian Supreme Court set him free on bail.\n        While 38 years is, thankfully, an uncommon stretch, spending a long time behind bars with no trial is not. In many countries, the practice is punishment first, trial later. The State Department reports that thousands of prisoners in India are detained awaiting trials for longer periods than they would receive if convicted. In India, Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic, Nigeria and dozens of other nations, the majority of people in prison have not yet been tried. Even in France and Italy, long pretrial detention is a serious problem.\n        The practice is abusive in many ways. Many of those held will eventually turn out to be innocent. Also, the crime victim's right to justice is violated. In the Dominican Republic, for example, 75 percent of suspects are detained until the statute of limitations has expired in a case and are then released.\n        Long-term detention is also the prime culprit in prison overcrowding, which turns third world prisons into violent, gang-controlled bedlams ridden with hepatitis, AIDS and tuberculosis. Long pretrial detention can turn a prison term into a death sentence for the merely accused. Rich people, of course, can pay lawyers or bribe judges and do not spend years awaiting trial. They rarely go to trial at all.\n        One possible solution is to speed up trials by changing legal systems. In many countries the judge acts as investigator, and trials are held only in writing. Cases drag on for years. A few countries in Latin America are experimenting with the system used in America and Britain, in which the judge weighs evidence presented orally in court by two adversaries.\n        In most developed nations, defendants can await trial while free on bail. Bail is effective, money-saving and humane. International human rights bodies have said it should go to all defendants except those who present a risk of flight, interfering with the justice system or committing a serious crime. But many countries restrict bail, or have no tradition of it. Changing that would free resources, reduce overcrowding and end a terrible injustice.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1679927,"ids":1679927,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Back in 1993, Vice President Al Gore went on prime-time television to debate Ross Perot, a foe of free trade, in a clash Mr. Gore is widely believed to have won. The debate helped propel supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement to victory in a 234-to-200 cliffhanger in the House. Some 102 Democrats -- representing the party traditionally more skeptical of liberalized trade -- voted for the pact. Afterward, President Bill Clinton called Nafta a defining moment for America. He said the country had decided not to retreat in a world where ''change is the only constant.'' Then he thanked lawmakers, particularly his fellow Democrats, for ''voting their consciences.''\n        Where are those Democrats now? Fast forward 12 years, and Mr. Clinton's wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, has yet to decide whether she's going to support the Central American Free Trade Agreement, or Cafta, which would open up trade, valued at $32 billion, between the United States and El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. Only four Democrats have announced their support, while the list of Democrats against grows ever longer. Last month the influential, centrist New Democrat Coalition of House lawmakers, usually pro-trade, came out against the deal.\n        The centrist Democrats argue that the Bush administration's irresponsible fiscal policies have robbed the nation of the ability to invest in programs that would cushion the blow for workers whose jobs migrate. It's true that America should be much more aggressive and creative on that front. But globalization isn't going away whether Cafta gets approved or not. Free-trade Democrats should be using their leverage to get more support for retraining assistance to displaced workers, not simply posturing with blanket opposition.\n        The Democrats also argue that the trade agreement's labor provisions don't go far enough to protect workers in the six other countries. But they are ignoring a provision that improves on existing rules by taking fines collected for violations of labor laws and using them to correct labor infractions. That's far better than the current system, in which penalties collected for labor violations end up in the United States Treasury.\n        The crux of the opposition seems to come from a general feeling of peevishness that the Bush administration didn't consult more with the pro-trade Democrats while negotiating the agreement. When you add that to the general anger over the Bush administration's failure to really negotiate with Democrats over issues from prescription drugs to education reform, it's understandable that they feel burned. But that doesn't make it right for them to take their marbles and go home. The Central American people deserve better.\n        Cafta would lower tariffs and help job growth in a needy region. It would encourage growth in the region's textile and apparel industries, a huge helping hand at a time when China is sucking up textile manufacturing jobs. The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates that Cafta would increase United States agricultural exports by $1.5 billion a year. The National Association of Manufacturers says the trade agreement would add $1 billion a year to United States exports of manufactured goods. And a study by the United States International Trade Commission estimates that Cafta, when fully implemented, would cut the trade deficit by $756 million.\n        ''This issue is much too important to allow your unhappiness with when somebody called you and when you were consulted stop you from doing what you know is right,'' says Cal Dooley, the former California Democratic congressman.

On one side is St. Lawrence Cement, a Canadian-based company with majority Swiss ownership that wants to close an old cement plant west of the river and build a giant new plant that would announce itself with a 40-story smokestack and dominate an 1,800-acre tract (including a 1,200-acre limestone quarry) running to the town's waterfront.\n        On the other side is a growing cohort of determined citizens organized by three advocacy groups -- Scenic Hudson, Friends of Hudson and the Olana Partnership -- who argue that the plant would unleash a plume of pollutants, damage the region's considerable scenic and cultural resources and discourage the small businesses, tourists and second-home residents the local economy has increasingly come to depend on. These critics also regard as inflated the company's claim that the plant will create many new jobs -- especially if St. Lawrence closes the old plant once the new one is built.\n        And in the middle, as is always the case when a big new plant seeks permission to build, is New York, in particular Gov. George E. Pataki, whose government must approve the necessary permits.\n        Until now, the opponents have focused most of their pressure on the State Department of Environmental Conservation, which last fall ordered a series of judicial hearings on various critical issues surrounding the plant, as mandated by environmental law. This process could go on for some time.\n        Last month, however, Scenic Hudson and its confederates opened a second line of attack, filing a detailed brief with New York's secretary of state. The brief asserts that the plant would violate at least a half-dozen protections for scenic resources, as well as air and water quality, provided by the state's coastal management plan. The company had claimed in an earlier application that the project was fully consistent with that plan.\n        A ruling from the secretary, Randy Daniels, is expected soon. A negative decision would deal the project a heavy blow because the Army Corps of Engineers could not then issue important permits without which the company cannot proceed, whatever the outcome of the other reviews. St Lawrence could appeal the ruling to the United States Department of Commerce, which oversees state plans for managing coastlines, but reversals are rare.\n        Whatever he does, Mr. Daniels will not be acting entirely on his own. The real decision here lies with Mr. Pataki. This page has urged Mr. Pataki on several occasions dating back to 2003 to block the project, not least because it is so obviously inconsistent with his vision for the Hudson River and, more broadly, his sound record of environmental stewardship. Here is another chance for him to do so.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1825931,"ids":1825931,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Before things get any more out of hand, President Bush needs to make his intentions toward Iran clear. And Congress needs to make it clear that this time it will be neither tricked nor bullied into supporting another disastrous war.\n        How little this administration has learned from its failures is a constant source of amazement. It seems the bigger the failure, the less it learns.\n        Consider last weekend's supersecret briefing in Baghdad by a group of American military officials whose names could not be revealed to the voters who are paying for this war with their taxes and their children's blood. The briefers tried to prove the White House's case that Iran is shipping deadly weapons, including armor-piercing explosives, to Shiite militias in Iraq.\n        Unlike Colin Powell's infamous prewar presentation on Iraq at the United Nations, this briefing had actual weapons to look at. And perhaps in time, the administration will be able to prove conclusively that the weapons came from arms factories in Iran.\n        But the officials offered no evidence to support their charge that ''the highest levels of the Iranian government'' had authorized smuggling these weapons into Iraq for use against American forces. Nor could they adequately explain why they had been sitting on this urgent evidence since 2004. The only thing that was not surprising was the refusal of any of the briefers to allow their names to be published. Mr. Powell is probably wondering why he didn't insist on the same deal.\n        We have no doubt about Iran's malign intent. Iran is defying the Security Council's order to halt its nuclear activities, and it is certainly meddling inside Iraq. But we are also certain that the Iraq war has so strained the American military and so shattered this president's credibility that shrill accusations and saber rattling are far more likely to frighten the allies America needs to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions than to change Tehran's behavior.\n        If Mr. Bush is truly worried about Shiite militias killing Americans in Iraq -- and he should be -- he needs to start showing this evidence to Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. The president needs to demand that Mr. Maliki stop protecting the militias and make it clear that there will be serious consequences if he continues to refuse.\n        If Mr. Bush is truly worried about Iran fanning Iraq's ever more bloody civil war -- and he should be -- he needs to stop fantasizing about regime change and start trying to find a way to persuade Iran's leaders to help rein in the chaos in Iraq.\n        And if Mr. Bush is worried that Americans no longer believe him when he warns of mortal threats to the country -- and he should be -- he needs to start proving that he really understands who is most responsible for the Iraq disaster. And he needs to explain how he plans to extricate American troops without setting off an even bigger war.\n        That's the briefing the American people need to hear.

It has a model prevention effort and was the first poor country to provide free AIDS treatment to all who need it, a program countries around the world are now beginning to emulate.\n        It has been able to afford this because Brazilian labs make copycat versions of expensive brand-name drugs. Brazil can freely copy any drug commercialized before 1997, when the country began to respect patents on medicines, a requirement for joining the World Trade Organization. But newer AIDS medicines are still imported and are expensive, and Brazil is spending two-thirds of its antiretroviral budget on just three of these drugs.\n        The government is now contemplating measures that would allow Brazilian labs to copy these drugs. Brazil's health ministry has asked the manufacturers of the drugs to voluntarily license Brazil to make copies. They have refused, and Brazil is threatening to break the patents and pay the holders a reasonable royalty, as W.T.O. rules require.\n        Right-wing groups in the United States and pharmaceutical manufacturers are calling this theft, and several members of Congress have asked the United States trade representative to apply trade sanctions. American trade officials have refrained, but they have criticized Brazil's threat to seize patents. While property rights deserve respect and should not be carelessly violated, what Brazil is doing is legal and deserves Washington's support.\n        Brazil's opponents argue that the country has no real AIDS emergency. Drug companies note that they offer Brazil drugs at deep discounts and say that Brazil can afford them. But the World Trade Organization rules are clear: they encourage all members to use the flexibilities in the intellectual property rules to promote access to medicine for all. Countries need not wait for an emergency, and Brazil isn't even a tough call.\n        Brazil's free universal treatment program, an indispensable weapon against the AIDS epidemic, locks Brazil's government into buying lifelong daily medicines for 170,000 people, and that number is rising. Brazil has the right to make sure it can continue to meet this burden by getting medicines at the cheapest possible price.\n        Breaking patents should be reserved for when it is clearly necessary to protect public health. But these rights have been underused. Only a handful of countries have used W.T.O. rules to break patents on medicines. Countries are intimidated, mainly by the United States. Health ministers who propose making copycat drugs are usually silenced by influential local business sectors afraid of trade retaliation.

The talks, he said, ''just won't move.''\n        For Mr. Amorim, and the other negotiators from developing countries that have been run over by the rich world in trade talks for the past 50 years, this page has two words: Stand fast. Do not give a single additional concession until the European Union cuts its farm subsidies. It's better to let the talks collapse and send the big guns home empty-handed than to be fooled again by Europe's hypocritical blather about free trade when clearly its countries, led by France, believe in free trade only when it suits their narrow interests.\n        For the last half-century, the World Trade Organization and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have aggressively dismantled barriers against trade in industrial goods and services, areas in which rich countries in Europe, along with the United States and Japan, hold a comparative advantage. But when it comes to areas where poor countries could flourish, like textiles and agriculture, it has been a different story.\n        The developed world funnels nearly $1 billion a day in subsidies to its farmers; that encourages overproduction, which drives down prices. Poor nations' farmers cannot compete with subsidized products. Four years ago, in Doha, Qatar, poor countries finally won a promise that Europe, Japan and America would slash agricultural subsidies, in addition to further liberalizing world trade in services and manufactured goods.\n        The United States has stepped up to the plate. Last month, the United States trade representative, Robert Portman, made a substantial offer: the United States will slash allowable farm subsidies by 60 percent if Europe and Japan cut their subsidies by 83 percent. There's a difference in the numbers because European countries and Japan have higher subsidies.\n        Europe has refused, with the French, as usual, leading the way and swearing to block any final agreement that goes beyond Europe's anemic offer of a handful of lame cuts. Then the European Union's trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, actually had the gall to ask poor countries to make further cuts in industrial tariffs and services.\n        If the European Union is truly going to refuse to make right a half-century of trade-distorting subsidies, which have helped the rich at the expense of the poor, then there's an easy answer: the talks should just not move.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1845359,"ids":1845359,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Bridgeport owes at least $2 million in legal fees and millions more in interest incurred during its six-year effort to avoid paying a contractor, C.

Klewin says it is innocent of any wrongdoing, and just wants to be paid. In the middle are taxpayers, many of whom fear the size of the bill they will very likely have to pay. Bridgeport is one of the poorest cities in the state and the country.\n        The city has consistently claimed that the contract with Klewin was intertwined with a kickback scheme between former Mayor Joseph Ganim and his former campaign manager, Leonard Grimaldi. Mr. Grimaldi served 13 months in prison and in a halfway house for his role in the scandal; Mr. Ganim is now serving a nine-year prison sentence for taking bribes. The company said it knew of no irregularities and produced a 2001 letter from the United States attorney stating it was not a target of any corruption investigation.\n        Given its troubled history, Bridgeport is right to go the extra mile in sending a message to would-be crooks who seek to exploit city contracts. But this particular legal fight borders on the obsessive.\n        Arbitrators told the city to pay the bill in 2004. The city fought on. Bridgeport then lost in State Superior Court. It appealed. Last month the State Supreme Court ruled against Bridgeport in a unanimous decision.\n        The city continues to litigate, hiring a new law firm and paying $1,600.43 a day in interest payments alone while it asks the Supreme Court for reconsideration. Should the city lose, which now appears extremely likely to happen, city taxpayers will have to shell out more than double the original $4.8 million bill because of interest and legal fees.\n        The city says that Bridgeport's ethics ordinance does not require all parties to know about corruption for a tainted deal to be null and void. By that reasoning, even if Klewin did not know that the contract award had irregularities, the city still should not have to pay the bill, Ronald Pacacha, the associate city attorney, said.\n        Bridgeport's intentions are right. But the city needs to think hard about whether continuing to fight is counterproducive. Mr. Pacacha says the city owes it to the taxpayers to fight this case.

While buyouts can set lagging businesses back on the right track, regulators and shareholders must be watchful to ensure that managers demand fair value for the companies.\n        In a typical buyout, a firm or consortium of firms purchases all the public stock in a company and takes the company private. The expression ''leveraged buyout'' refers to the large debt that usually finances this process -- the way a homebuyer makes a down payment on a much larger mortgage.\n        The $33 billion acquisition of the hospital chain HCA earlier this year ranks as the largest leveraged buyout ever. Two firms recently bid $15 billion for Harrah's Entertainment, the world's largest casino operator. These deals are happening across the economy, as everyone from wealthy individuals to investment banks hunt for high-return investment opportunities. Even pension funds have gotten into the business, helping to fuel the trend.\n        According to Thomson Financial, buyout firms have spent $275 billion so far this year taking companies private, or over a quarter of the $1 trillion total for mergers and acquisitions. In the previous 20 years the highest share was 14.1 percent.\n        Leveraged buyouts have something of a bad reputation for what, in its worst form, is something like corporate looting. In those cases, a company's balance sheet would be quickly loaded with high levels of debt to pay the buyers exorbitant dividends and management fees. They would then flip the debt-ridden company as quickly as possible, either to another buyer or through a public offering.\n        Done correctly, a buyout can be a very productive way to unlock a business's real potential. Once a company is privately held, management can ignore the short-term dictates of the stock market and focus on the investments needed for long-term growth. A recent Harvard Business School study found that when bought-out companies were put back on the equity market they outperformed other initial public offerings and the market as a whole.\n        The main concern for shareholders, however, is the initial sale price. Corporate management can face conflicts of interest when the terms of a bid are better for top executives than shareholders. And management often leads a buyout itself, which discourages other prospective buyers from submitting competing bids and keeps the price artificially low.\n        The Justice Department reportedly is looking into whether the old-boy network of private-equity firms has gotten a little too chummy, examining whether firms are colluding to keep prices low. It is a move we support. Too often public stockholders end up getting the raw end of these deals.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1796799,"ids":1796799,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"By approving the merger between AT&amp;T and BellSouth unconditionally, the Bush administration has again abdicated responsibility for protecting consumers when huge companies combine.\n        Fierce competition between private companies is at the core of the nation's economic strength. But government still has an important role to play as referee, making sure that the rough-and-tumble game of capitalism doesn't become perversely uncompetitive through significant concentrations of market power in the hands of a few companies.\n        From the very start, the Bush administration's approach to antitrust and merger policy has been much more hands-off than its predecessors'. In an era of rapid consolidation and deregulation, the Justice Department hasn't brought a single major monopoly case under the Sherman Antitrust Act since the Clinton administration went after Microsoft for illegally defending its monopoly for the Windows operating system. The department settled that case during President Bush's first year in office.\n        That set the tone for a merger policy that often appears to be little more than ''anything goes.'' One gets the impression at times that the referee has left the playing field.\n        Perhaps the clearest example came earlier this year when the department cleared Whirlpool's $1.7 billion acquisition of Maytag, which gave the combined company up to three-quarters of the market for some home appliances. As Stephen Labaton reported in The Times shortly thereafter, that decision actually demoralized career officials in the department's antitrust division.\n        Not only has the government failed to bring many significant cases, it is opposing one brought and won by a third party. The Supreme Court will hear a case in which a jury found that Weyerhaeuser monopolized a market for logs in the Pacific Northwest. The Bush administration filed a brief asking the court to reverse the decision, already upheld on appeal.\n        A federal district judge is reviewing the antitrust settlements that previously allowed SBC Communications to acquire AT&amp;T and Verizon to buy MCI. But by approving the AT&amp;T-BellSouth merger without a single condition, the Justice Department has allowed this one to avoid judicial review.\n        That leaves the Federal Communications Commission. The commission has scheduled a meeting to discuss the merger today. It should take a long, hard look at the deal, and the overall trend toward consolidation in the telecommunications industry. There are strong arguments that competition with cable companies and Internet phone services have changed the playing field. But the commissioners should pursue the question thoroughly rather than wielding a rubber stamp as the Justice Department sometimes appears to. They must think first about protecting consumers, while bearing in mind that bigger is not always better.","adu_anecdote":14,"adu_other":5,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1835423,"ids":1835423,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"By day, lawmakers feud over the state budget with new-found intensity.

His action will transform New York's taxi fleet from the most polluting in the nation to one of the cleanest, and do so in five years, making the city a leader as municipalities compete to cut carbon emissions.\n        Most city cabs are Ford Crown Victoria sedans, which get a measly 10 to 15 miles a gallon in city driving. Taxis will have to get 25 miles per gallon by the end of next year and 30 miles per gallon the following year. Because individual taxis are replaced every three to five years, the new vehicles will need to be high-mileage hybrids, the only car that currently meets the stiffer mileage standard and is suitable for the work demanded of a taxi.\n        The idea of an environmentally friendly fleet is not new, but Mr. Bloomberg's full embrace of it is. The Bloomberg administration had been at best deliberate in moving on a City Council mandate two years ago to bring some green into the yellow cab ranks. In that time, only about 375 hybrids have joined a fleet of more than 13,000 cabs.\n        The Taxi and Limousine Commission had long defended the status quo, noting the extra legroom in the Crown Victoria. But that's just two inches more than the hybrid Ford, and the commission's latest message is more positive. It tells drivers who worry about the higher initial cost of hybrids that they'll save as much as $10,000 a year in fuel.\n        The Mayor deserves credit for seeing the green light, and for acknowledging those who helped him see it. Chief among these is David Yassky, the Brooklyn City Councilman, who has waged a long campaign for cleaner-burning cabs and who encouraged the mayor to set a faster target of five years instead of 10.\n        Until the city's announcement, New York lagged behind other large cities, including San Francisco, which aims to have all hybrid or clean-burning compressed natural gas vehicles by 2010. As impressive as that may sound, San Francisco total fleet is just one-tenth the size of New York's.\n        The shift to hybrids will cut the city's carbon dioxide emissions by 215,000 tons -- a figure that pales compared to New York's annual total of 58.3 million metric tons. But it is just one piece of what can be accomplished by a determined mayor and a cooperative City Council without having to appeal to the state or federal governments.\n        And of course it fits perfectly with Mr. Bloomberg's lofty vision of putting New York in the vanguard of the global effort to stabilize and eventually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As he noted at a recent convocation of mayors, cities are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions. His strategy for reducing New York's share includes -- in addition to cleaner cabs -- more efficient heating and cooling systems in buildings, cleaner power plants and a system of congestion pricing that aims to reduce inner-city traffic during the daytime. And there are other municipal vehicles that could stand a bit of cleaning up, not least school buses.\n        If the city can accomplish all this, Mr. Bloomberg's ambitious goal of reducing the city's greenhouse emissions by 30 percent by 2030 could well be attainable after all.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1854779,"ids":1854779,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"By this time next week, the left-for-dead Senate immigration bill should be up off the slab, lurching toward a final vote. It almost died when Republicans tried to weigh it down with too many harsh amendments. But now it's coming back, thanks to some late attention from President Bush, a rush to repackage it as a super-heavy-duty enforcement measure -- with $4.4 billion to be thrown at the border right away, as a good-faith gesture to the anti-amnesty crowd -- and a deal to limit the amendments from both parties to only a couple dozen.\n        Congress's struggle with immigration reform has been a horror movie, with one false ending after another, and there is still no telling what the monster will look like when the lights finally come up. People who have been watching through their fingers are right to be worried; the bill was harsh and has gotten harsher, a reflection of the rigidity of those who have vowed to kill any reform they consider amnesty.\n        Keep a close eye this week on the amendments that make the short list for the coming debate. This will be the main opportunity for senators who were not involved in the ''grand bargain'' to shape -- or eviscerate -- the bill to their liking. Details were fluid into last night, but at least five of the possible amendments seem manifestly awful.\n        Kay Bailey Hutchison has an amendment to send applicants for legalization on a ''touchback'' trip abroad before getting their Z visas, a new hurdle sure to discourage participation in the program. John Ensign would prevent those who paid into Social Security as illegal immigrants from ever getting that money back, and cut off their young children from death benefits. Norm Coleman would require that all state and local laws that forbid government employees to ask people's immigration status be stricken before other provisions of the bill take effect. Christopher Bond would simply forbid holders of Z visas from ever getting green cards.\n        And Lindsey Graham, who has spoken movingly about the need for reasonable, decent treatment of immigrants, especially immigrant families, has been trying to take the debate back to the dark days of Representative Jim Sensenbrenner's anti-immigrant bill, with an amendment that would turn people who overstay their visas into criminals subject to minimum 60-day prison sentences.\n        It seems likely that Mr. Graham, who is one of the ''grand bargainers'' and is up for re-election next year, has been burned by the uproar on the hard right and feels the need to act tough, lest he be saddled -- as Representative Steve King of Iowa has urged -- with the scarlet letter A, for amnesty.\n        That is a shame, because Mr. Graham knows as well as anyone that the only workable immigration reform will be one that values being smart over being reflexively tough. It will be one that combines enforcement at the border and in the workplace with a path to legal status, even citizenship, for the immigrants already here, and a lawful and orderly flow of future workers. That's the dream, anyway. Congress had a bill like that once, a while back, but the dream is in great danger of slipping away.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1788850,"ids":1788850,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"C. Lee Hanson, of Easton, rarely plans ahead to visit Connecticut's memorial to the victims of Sept. 11. But at odd moments he finds himself going to the site, on Long Island Sound at Sherwood Island State Park in Westport. There, he sees once again the three names carved in stone: those of his son, Peter; his son's wife, Sue; and their 2-year-old daughter, Christine. They were passengers on United Flight 175 and died when their airplane hit the World Trade Center five years ago tomorrow.\n        Paula Clifford Scott of Mystic goes there, too, mostly during annual memorial services. There are two familiar names etched in stone, and on her heart: those of her daughter, Ruth McCourt, and 4-year-old granddaughter, Juliana. They were on the same flight as Mr. Hanson's family, and were among the 152 from Connecticut who died that day.\n        States with the largest losses from the attacks have had difficulty memorializing those who died. New York only recently awarded the first big construction contract for the footings of a memorial at the World Trade Center site. New Jersey's state memorial, under construction at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, has run into opposition because it obscures views of Lower Manhattan from the park.\n        But Connecticut, at former Gov. John Rowland's urging, moved swiftly to create a state tribute to the victims of Sept. 11. Within seven months a site overlooking the Sound had been chosen. At the first anniversary of the attacks, the memorial was taking shape, with nearly every element donated -- including the design, done with the participation of victims' families. Best of all is the location. In a place where sea meets sky, the memorial offers the promise of tranquillity, even in the face of loss.\n        ''I like simple things,'' Mr. Hanson said, and it pleases him that the design of the memorial is not complicated. The names of the victims are carved in granite bricks, scattered randomly, to symbolize the senselessness of the act that took their lives. Beach roses bloom nearby, and benches invite contemplation. On a clear day, the Manhattan skyline is visible. It is from here that horrified Connecticut residents watched the billowing smoke from New York City after the attacks, and mobilized to help.\n        Asked what the state memorial meant to her, Ms. Scott said: ''Remembrance -- and life. Life stopped for a little while that day. It was up to us to begin again.''\n        Connecticut's lovely memorial to Sept. 11 keeps alive memories of the victims, comforts the families and offers solace to visitors. It stands also as a monument in proud contradiction to those who say government cannot do anything right.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1822578,"ids":1822578,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Canada set an important example of decency when it offered a formal apology and compensation worth millions of dollars to a Syrian-born Canadian citizen who was a victim of President Bush's use of open-ended detention, summary deportation and even torture in the name of fighting terrorism.\n        Last week's announcement by Prime Minister Stephen Harper came more than four years after the nightmare began for the Canadian, Maher Arar, a 36-year-old software engineer. On his way back from a family vacation, he was detained by U.S. officials at Kennedy Airport on the basis of unsubstantiated information from the Canadian police. After being held in solitary confinement in a Brooklyn detention center and interrogated without proper access to legal counsel, he was sent to Syria, where he was imprisoned for nearly a year and tortured.\n        It was all part of a legally and morally unsupportable practice known as extraordinary rendition, the deportation of terrorism suspects to countries where the regimes are known to use torture and to disdain basic human rights protections.\n        Four months ago, a Canadian government panel concluded that Mr. Arar had never had a terrorism connection, and that Americans had misled Canada about their plans for him. The Bush administration stonewalled the inquiry. It has responded to a new Canadian request to remove Mr. Arar from a United States security watch list by rudely telling Canada, its democratic northern neighbor and strategic ally, to mind its own business.\n        Not only has the Bush administration refused to apologize to Mr. Arar, but Justice Department lawyers are also brandishing a dubious claim of state secrets and fighting a lawsuit brought by Mr. Arar in this country. Bush administration officials insist that they have ''new intelligence'' that justifies keeping Mr. Arar on the watch list. That intelligence has not been disclosed, but Canadian officials who have reviewed the information are unpersuaded.\n        Questioned about the Arar case at a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales provided no specifics that would explain Mr. Arar's continued presence on the watch list, or why he had been deported to Syria in the first place. The committee's chairman, Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, is right to demand that the administration face up to its bad behavior in this case and renounce its renditions policy.\n        This is not just about making amends with Canada, or doing the right thing by someone who appears to be an innocent man.

Justice Roberts devoted his second annual year-end report to this issue, and it should be required reading in Congress.\n        Getting Congress to act promptly on judicial salaries may not be easy, if history is any guide. But Mr. Roberts is right to note the link between maintaining an adequate standard of judicial compensation and preserving the quality and independence of the judiciary, and to prod Congress on this issue.\n        For starters, an immediate increase in the neighborhood of 30 percent would help make up for dual blows of inflation and Congress's periodic withholding of cost-of-living adjustments. The last time federal judges received a substantial pay raise was 1989.\n        By statute, a sitting federal trial judge makes $165,200 a year. That's a lot of money, the same pay as a member of Congress. But as the chief justice notes in his report, judges have fallen well behind the American labor force as a whole in keeping up with inflation. Since 1969, a judge's pay has declined by 23.9 percent, adjusted for inflation, while the national average for all wages rose by 17.8 percent.\n        Federal judges at every level earn significantly less than law school deans, senior law school professors, and even junior associates at some big-time law firms. There is no definitive study, but it cannot be just coincidental that federal judges are leaving the bench at an increasing rate, thereby ''threatening the viability of life tenure,'' as Justice Roberts put it. Considering the impact on a future job could make judges less willing to issue unpopular rulings upholding important rights.\n        It is tempting to dismiss as hyperbole the chief justice's characterization of this issue as a ''constitutional crisis.'' But the salary issue is a serious one, touching as it does on the two constitutional provisions designed to ensure an independent judiciary -- the one granting life tenure, and the other ensuring no reduction in judicial pay.\n        The chief justice's focus on judicial pay has drawn praise from Senator Patrick Leahy, the new Judiciary Committee chairman and a longtime champion of improved judicial salaries. The nation would be well-served by a comprehensive bipartisan package that grants federal judges a sizable raise, ends the linkage between judicial and Congressional salaries, and requires judges to forgo privately financed junkets that cast an ethical cloud on the courts.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1851785,"ids":1851785,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Children learn a lot at school, not all of it for the better. As the Institute of Medicine reported in April, too many children pick up very bad eating habits, habits that can eventually kill them. Part of the problem is what the institute calls ''competitive foods.'' Instead of choosing the standard lunch, students choose junk food, much of it loaded with sugar, fat and salt -- the fuel for future diabetes or heart disease.\n        Armed with mounting data on these dangers, lawmakers in Albany have finally started looking seriously at new guidelines for what young people eat or drink on public school property. Gov. Eliot Spitzer, the Assembly Democrats and the State Senate have each come up with proposals this year for better fare for students.\n        It is very good news that somebody is at least bringing attention to the issue. But there are problems with the proposals. One is that the governor and Assembly seem to be encouraging the use of sports drinks in schools. As the Center for Science in the Public Interest has noted, most sports drinks are heavy with sugar and salts. A better option would simply be plain old water.\n        Moreover, Mr. Spitzer's bill, which is probably too detailed to be workable, would require students to exercise for an hour before they could buy something like Gatorade. Huh? Some schools don't even have proper gyms and offer little opportunity for students to work out 30 minutes a day, much less an hour. Furthermore, sports drinks are designed for marathoners or football players, not the middle school dance class.\n        The Senate bill offers little more than goals and guidelines. The Assembly version would allow state health and education officials to set guidelines for better nutrition in schools, which makes sense. But the Assembly bill also makes trouble. It would allow a la carte items with too much fat, sugar or salt as long as the rest of the food offered at the cafeteria is acceptable.\n        The Institute of Medicine has recommended that only low-fat and nonfat dairy products be sold in schools. All of these bills sidestep that issue, particularly the Assembly's, which boots the decision down the chain of command to local school districts. Finally, somebody should figure out how to keep bake sales during school hours from becoming the place where students can gorge on goodies that are forbidden elsewhere.\n        In earlier sessions, when the loudest voice against obesity was Assemblyman Felix Ortiz, who wanted to tax high-fat food, the whole idea of legislating against obesity was seen as a sideshow. Since then, the data has steadily become more alarming, with obesity rates tripling in adolescents since 1980. And those young people grow into sickly adults -- almost one-third of America's adults are obese.\n        Albany is right to focus on the problem in the early years. But legislators must listen to the health experts and not the lobbyists for the food, drink and dairy businesses. That means banning sodas, candy, sports drinks and high-fat dairy products.\n        It's not what is good for business that counts here, it is what is good for New York's 2.8 million public school children.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":4,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1641562,"ids":1641562,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Children were one-third of the casualties of the tsunamis, and those who survived are suffering the worst effects of their aftermath. Untold thousands have been orphaned or separated from their families. Without protection or caregivers, they are at greatest risk for starvation and disease. They are also in danger from human traffickers, who have long operated in South Asia with near impunity, and who must have viewed the tsunamis as providing an opportunity to prey. Amazingly, these criminals seem to have been largely stymied by governments determined to prevent further tragedy. In a region devoid of cheer, this is at least a hopeful moment.\n        Soon after the wave hit, Indonesia -- where an estimated 35,000 children have lost one or both parents -- moved to protect young people in hard-hit Aceh, barring the departure of children from that province unless they are accompanied by verifiable family members. Thailand is doing the same, and other areas are imposing their own controls. The emphasis is on finding lost children, registering them and housing them until they can be reunited with their families. Adoptions -- which can sometimes be a front for trafficking -- have been suspended in several countries. Child protection officers are making themselves visible in villages.\n        These extraordinary efforts will no doubt save young people who might otherwise be exported for sale as sex slaves or sweatshop labor. While estimates vary, the nations of South Asia are notorious for supplying a large part of the hundreds of thousands of children trafficked every year as part of a $12 billion criminal enterprise worldwide.\n        The clampdown by countries hit by the tsunamis follows pressure from the State Department, Unicef and nongovernmental organizations, like World Vision and Vital Voices, which have ratcheted up their monitoring and joined efforts to protect the most vulnerable disaster victims. The enormity of the tsunamis' impact and attention from a watchful world seem to have helped local officials get past the corruption in their ranks and overcome the kind of denial that has in the past helped give traffickers a pass. As a result, there have been just a handful of confirmed reports of post-tsunami child trafficking.\n        Welcome as these efforts are, they will mean little unless they evolve into a regionwide commitment to keep up the pressure to stop child exploitation, not just as part of the recovery from a disaster, but as an investment in a collective future.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1820043,"ids":1820043,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"China spread alarm and consternation among space powers when it destroyed one of its own satellites last week with a missile fired from the ground, thus becoming the first nation in more than two decades to successfully test an antisatellite weapon. This aggressive show of force puts a wide range of United States military and intelligence satellites at risk and holds the danger of starting an arms race in space. Too bad the Bush administration's own bellicose attitudes -- and adamant refusal to consider an arms control treaty for space -- give it scant standing to chastise the Chinese. The administration needs to reverse course promptly and join in talks aimed at banning further tests or use of antisatellite weapons.\n        The Chinese test, which Beijing has not acknowledged but was tracked by intelligence agencies, destroyed an aging communications satellite some 500 miles above the Earth. The missile smashed the satellite into hundreds of pieces large enough to pose a danger for a decade or more to spacecraft or satellites that pass through the debris.\n        The Chinese have now demonstrated that -- should they ever choose -- they could destroy essential American satellites used to conduct military reconnaissance, spot nuclear tests and direct smart weapons. A top intelligence official told reporters last August that China had used a ground-based laser to illuminate an American satellite. That could signal a nascent effort to develop a way to blind satellites or to guide a missile to a target in space.\n        The Bush administration has been flexing its own muscles in space. A national space policy issued in October declared that ''freedom of action in space is as important to the United States as air power and sea power.'' It asserted a need to deter others from interfering with America's right to operate in space. The policy did not address whether Washington would place weapons in space -- as some in the Pentagon have been urging -- but the administration continues to oppose any restrictions.\n        Surely it would make military and diplomatic sense to pursue the opposite course and seek to ban all tests and any use of antisatellite weapons.\n        The United States and the Soviet Union successfully tested such weapons decades ago and have no overriding need to develop better versions, although the United States is clearly trying. China's success in matching the feat reportedly came after three earlier tests failed, so the Chinese could only benefit from additional testing. The United States, with many more satellites in orbit than any other power and a military that has become increasingly dependent on satellites, has the most to lose from an unbridled space arms race.\n        Some experts suggest that China's latest test is intended to prod the United States to join serious negotiations. The way to counter China or any other potentially belligerent space power is through an arms control treaty, not a new arms race in space.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1689127,"ids":1689127,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"China's currency revaluation was not as big as the blame-Beijing-first crowd in Congress has been demanding. But it is the start of something big, and now it's up to Congress to show equal sense.\n        For more than a decade, China has fixed the exchange rate of its currency, the yuan, to the dollar. That provided stability, helping China to weather the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998 and supporting its subsequent economic growth. But in recent months, some members of Congress have threatened China with punitive tariffs, claiming that the practice of fixing the yuan to the dollar made Chinese products artificially cheap on global markets and hurt American exports. They overstated their case, but the political threat was clear.\n        To its credit, the administration has tried to restrain the Congressional neoprotectionists. That bought the Chinese some time, and yesterday, they acted. They loosely linked the yuan's value to a basket of currencies, pushing it up 2 percent against the dollar immediately and leaving open the possibility of a larger appreciation in the weeks and months ahead.\n        The China bashers have been hoping for a revaluation of 10 percent or more, and we'll know better in the near future how far China is prepared to go. Right now, it is important to applaud China's willingness to act, and acknowledge the very substantial risks it is taking. The revaluation, for instance, is likely to attract currency speculators who will pour in the kind of money that feeds bubbles, which can burst with disastrous consequences.\n        The anti-China crowd in Congress should also get serious about making a lasting dent in the budget deficit. Doing so would address global imbalances more effectively than a yuan revaluation because it would reduce the nation's need to borrow billions of dollars a day from abroad. In fact, the sooner Congress can see international imbalances as a problem largely of America's own making, the better.\n        When China was rigidly fixing its exchange rate, it did so by buying vast amounts of United States Treasuries. Under its new flexible currency regime, the day may come when China will not need to buy as many Treasuries. But unless Washington curbs its deficits, the United States could still need China to buy its securities, and that situation could lead to sharply higher United States interest rates.\n        China needs a more flexible currency mainly to manage its own economy better. But the move should also be good for international trade relations if the United States can rise to the occasion.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1670339,"ids":1670339,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"China's rapid economic growth and steady military modernization are transforming power relations across Asia. In recent weeks, Beijing has reached out to its old rival, New Delhi, courted Taiwanese opposition parties and fanned old grievances against Japan. This comes on top of the long-term deals that Chinese diplomats have been signing to give Beijing special access to the raw materials of Southeast Asia and Australia.\n        It's time for the United States to take more notice. America may still be Asia's dominant military power, but its economic role is receding as China advances. Unfortunately, Asian policy, long a stepchild for the Bush administration, has been further marginalized, thanks to the exit of the State Department's most respected Asia hands, Richard Armitage and Mitchell Reiss. Paul Wolfowitz's move to the World Bank leaves a similar void at the Pentagon.\n        By working out clear understandings with Beijing on regional issues today, Washington could help avoid unnecessary and highly destructive future conflicts. Here's what Washington should be focusing on right now:\n        Japan -- For years, the United States has urged Tokyo to cast off its postwar pacifism and play a larger role in regional defense. Japan's current prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, is happy to oblige. But he has combined a more assertive military stance with an embrace of right-wing nationalism that offends and alarms the Asian nations that suffered wartime Japanese aggression and atrocities. His repeated visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo have been particularly provocative; the shrine is where top Japanese war criminals are among the honored and the country's Asian conquests are celebrated.\n        In this context, it was a mistake for Washington to encourage Japan recently to declare a security interest in matters concerning Taiwan, a former Japanese colony. Beijing seized on this declaration, along with Japan's bid for a permanent United Nations Security Council seat, as a pretext for permitting three weekends of anti-Japanese violence last month. Beijing achieved its purpose of throwing Tokyo onto the defensive, but is wrong to oppose Japan's Security Council bid and reckless to stir up past grievances. China and Japan, Asia's two biggest economic powers, need to work out a healthier relationship, and Washington should be actively looking for ways to help them.\n        Taiwan -- Beijing finally seems to be learning that honey works better than vinegar in winning over Taiwanese opinion. The warm welcome China gave last week to Taiwan's main opposition leader has now forced the island's independence-minded president, Chen Shui-bian, to send an emissary of his own. While Beijing's clear goal is to undermine Mr. Chen's party and help the opposition Nationalists, it has nevertheless set in motion a constructive dynamic that contrasts sharply with the negative response its menacing antisecession law elicited in March. The Bush administration should strongly support any initiative by either side that can help preserve an acceptable, if ambiguous, status quo.\n        India -- China's prime minister visited India last month and signed a series of agreements intended to increase bilateral trade and end a long-festering set of border disputes that once brought the two countries to war. An improved relationship between these rapidly developing countries, which are home to about 40 percent of the world's population, can only be welcomed. But it signals an enormous shift in the Asian power equation.\n        Washington must adjust to a rising China. The future peace and prosperity of Asia depend on it.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1662957,"ids":1662957,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Columbia University has been roiled for months by a contentious dispute over allegations of intimidation of students in the Middle East studies program. Sad to say, the school has botched the handling of this emotionally charged issue from the start, thereby allowing festering concerns to erupt into a full-scale boil.\n        A faculty committee's report, released last week, cited the frustration of students who felt they had no place to register complaints about what they considered abusive treatment by outspokenly pro-Palestinian professors. The university had no clear mechanism to handle such grievances.\n        Only after a film by an outside group brought the students' complaints to broad public attention did the university appoint a panel to look into the issue. It botched this job, too, by appointing one member who had been the dissertation adviser for a professor who had drawn criticism and appointing three members who had expressed anti-Israel views that, critics allege, might incline them to soft-pedal complaints. It also limited the panel's mandate to include only some of the areas of complaint.\n        People involved in the deliberations believe that the panel proceeded carefully and objectively in evaluating the evidence, but its composition ensured that the results would be greeted with skepticism. The members aren't to blame for that -- it's the fault of the administration, which approached the project with such political ineptitude. Fortunately, Columbia is belatedly rising to the challenge. It will establish new grievance procedures shortly. And it has recognized that the Middle East studies department was out of control and, with the goal of strengthening its scholarship, has wrested away its power to appoint and promote faculty.\n        Only one member of the department, Joseph Massad, was judged clearly guilty of inappropriate conduct. The panel found that he had replied angrily and heatedly to a student who had simply asked whether Israel sometimes gave advance warning before bombing a building so people could get out and avoid harm. It also cited a second ''gray area'' incident, when the same teacher, in an off-campus lecture, responded testily to an Israeli student who had served in that country's armed forces by asking how many Palestinians he had killed. Had that incident occurred in the classroom, the panel concluded, it would clearly have been out of bounds.\n        Given the generally high marks accorded the panel by dispassionate observers, its findings seem to indicate that the controversy over Middle East studies at Columbia has been overblown. There is no evidence that anyone's grade suffered for challenging the pro-Palestinian views of any teacher or that any professors made anti-Semitic statements. The professors who were targeted have legitimate complaints themselves. Their classes were infiltrated by hecklers and surreptitious monitors, and they received hate mail and death threats.\n        But in the end, the report is deeply unsatisfactory because the panel's mandate was so limited. Most student complaints were not really about intimidation, but about allegations of stridently pro-Palestinian, anti-Israeli bias on the part of several professors. The panel had no mandate to examine the quality and fairness of teaching. That leaves the university to follow up on complaints about politicized courses and a lack of scholarly rigor as part of its effort to upgrade the department. One can only hope that Columbia will proceed with more determination and care than it has heretofore.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1820702,"ids":1820702,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Companies are proving that when it comes to health care, you can re-teach old dogs an old trick. On-site health clinics in the workplace, which had been disappearing since their peak in the 1970s, are staging a comeback. Corporations are waking up to the fact that healthy employees are more productive, while sick workers are a drag on the bottom line. And they're trying to do something about it.\n        The sky-high cost of health care in the United States isn't just a challenge for the families that struggle to pay rising premiums and co-payments. It's also a serious issue for American companies, whose competitors in other countries often benefit from national health insurance programs.\n        As Milt Freudenheim reported recently in The Times, some big American-based companies have rediscovered that it's cheaper in the long run to spend a little more on in-house health clinics. Companies from the Pepsi Bottling Group to Credit Suisse have opened or expanded their clinics. More than a quarter of the nation's 1,000 largest employers will likely offer some kind of on-site health services by the end of the year.\n        For employees, a clinic is a major time saver, convenient and cheap (or even free). For companies, spending a relatively small amount of money on early detection and basic preventive care can save on expensive hospital bills down the line. It's an interesting stopgap solution, provided companies do not abuse their knowledge of employee medical conditions and remain focused on the long-term health of their workers, instead of just steering them away from expensive procedures.\n        Innovative as they are, office and factory infirmaries will hardly solve the nation's entrenched health care crisis.\n        Total health spending reached nearly $2 trillion in 2005, accounting for 16 percent of the economy. It is a bit scary that the 6.9 percent increase in health spending that year -- rather than a cause for alarm -- is celebrated as the slowest pace of increase in six years. There are 47 million uninsured people in this country. State governments, like those in Massachusetts and California, are trying to chip away at the problem and business groups are lobbying in Washington for help with out-of-control costs.\n        While it is a welcome sign that businesses and states are trying to come up with answers, health care is a national issue that requires a comprehensive solution.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1829070,"ids":1829070,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Comptroller may be a sleepy job title, but the New York State comptroller is one of the most powerful officials in the nation.

The importance of the position leaves New Yorkers with a big problem.\n        The new comptroller, former Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli, was installed by his friends in the Legislature and has no investment experience.\n        That means New York's workers and retirees are suddenly depending on a novice to manage an investment pool far larger than those supervised by Wall Street's top money managers. And it means a former legislator with deep ties to the Democratic Party and its fund-raisers can now choose which managers and banks and lawyers get hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.\n        Mr. DiNapoli has a lot of work to do if he is to persuade people that he really is the right choice for this critical job. Here are the places he should start:\n        Declare that he will not take campaign contributions from anyone who does business with his office. Not a penny. The appearance of complete impartiality is essential for an official charged with safeguarding state workers' pension funds.\n        Investors, bond lawyers and all the managers should be chosen for their expertise, not their inside connections.\n        Make all pension investments clear and transparent. Mr. DiNapoli should commit to revealing at least every quarter who gets fees, how much and, most important, why.\n        Hold on to the highly qualified professionals already in the comptroller's office. If Mr. DiNapoli is going to do well, he needs smart, experienced people around him. The good staff in place now should not be pushed out to make room for patronage hires.\n        There is also one thing Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Legislature should do: end the comptroller's sole trusteeship over the pension fund. California's pension fund, the nation's largest, is run with something akin to a board of directors. That makes for slower, more conservative investing, but that is not a bad thing when it comes to retirement money.\n        Mr. DiNapoli has already had one lapse of judgment since taking office, attending a Democratic fund-raiser at which he apparently went out of his way to praise the one man most responsible for giving him this job -- Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. It is time for Mr. DiNapoli to show that he is not beholden to Mr. Silver or the Legislature, and to start proving his skeptics wrong.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1848146,"ids":1848146,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Confronted with soaring gasoline prices, a Congress growing more restless by the day about oil dependency and a Supreme Court demanding executive action on global warming emissions, President Bush stepped before the cameras in the Rose Garden the other day and said, essentially, nothing.\n        He announced that he had ordered four federal agencies to ''work together'' to devise regulations reducing greenhouse gases. He also renewed his call for greater investments in alternative fuels. But neither he nor the cadre of designated briefers who followed him provided any detail, so nobody knows whether he will in fact end up asking for more efficient cars or what sort of alternative fuels he has in mind or, more broadly, what sort of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions he hopes to achieve.\n        What we did learn was that he has chosen to make the process as cumbersome and time-consuming as possible. We also learned that nothing concrete will happen until the regulatory process is completed at the end of 2008 -- a mere three weeks before Mr. Bush walks out the White House door. As Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, aptly noted, this ''will leave motor vehicle fuel economy stuck in neutral until Bush's successor takes office.''\n        This is, in short, yet another of Mr. Bush's faith-based energy strategies, in which the operative words are ''trust me.'' The White House says that good regulations need time to develop. That is true, but we would be more inclined to cut Mr. Bush some slack if not for the fact that speedier routes are readily available.\n        For one thing, he could have simplified matters by letting the Environmental Protection Agency run the whole regulatory show, which is what the Supreme Court had in mind. He could also have ordered the E.P.A. to grant California the permission it has been seeking for more than two years to impose its own emissions standards on cars and light trucks, which it can do under the Clean Air Act once it gets a federal waiver. But the automakers desperately do not want California or the 11 other states that plan to imitate California to get that authority, and Mr. Bush is obviously in no hurry to grant it.\n        What we are seeing is the obligatory response of a president who finds himself boxed into a corner by Congress and the court and forced to appear to be doing something. At bottom, his administration doubts the urgency of the climate change issue and remains deeply averse to mandates and regulatory timetables.\n        Nowhere has this been more clear than in Germany, where administration officials have spent the last few weeks trying to water down commitments for next month's Group of 8 meeting.\n        Specifically, it has objected to any treatment of global warming as an urgent problem and rejected long-term emissions targets backed by other nations and, increasingly, by many of Mr. Bush's natural allies in the business community.

It has worked in Stockholm and London, where skepticism gave way to resounding support. Residents of both cities were turned around by the unclogged streets, quicker commutes, better public transportation and cleaner air. Now that Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants to give congestion pricing a try, state leaders, starting with Gov. Eliot Spitzer, should get on board.\n        Mr. Bloomberg's proposed traffic reliever -- charging $8 for most drivers on streets south of 86th Street in Manhattan during prime weekday hours -- requires state approval to move forward. With less than four weeks remaining in the regular legislative session, time is short.\n        Mr. Spitzer's enthusiastic support could help give the plan the boost it needs and burnish his own environmental credentials. So far he's been noncommittal, and the clock is ticking.\n        There is good reason to act quickly. As much as $500 million of federal funding for a three-year pilot project is hanging in the balance. If there is no green light from Albany before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, the money may have to be reauthorized.\n        The financial case for congestion pricing is compelling. The fees that are collected would help pay for $31 billion in mass transit capital improvements over the next two decades. State lawmakers have not offered any other ideas for coming up with that critical funding. If congestion pricing does not go through, transit riders can expect a fare hike, perhaps as early as this year, along with tax increases. That would be a greater burden on New Yorkers than a voluntary fee.\n        The cautious reception that congestion pricing has received so far is understandable. The Spitzer administration is concerned that it would give the city more control of transit purse strings. But a city-state power-sharing agreement can be worked out. Opponents in boroughs outside Manhattan, meanwhile, have been complaining that working people will be hurt. But studies show that relatively few working people drive to jobs in Manhattan right now. Many more commuters from these boroughs would benefit from the money that congestion pricing would contribute to improved transportation.\n        Mr. Bloomberg's plan, introduced just one month ago, clearly got a late start for this legislative session.

No doubt some voters will be reassured by the idea that covering 700 miles of the 2,000-mile southwestern border with razor wire and floodlights will solve this thing once and for all. But many others will continue to suspect that it is more complicated than that.\n        With a better start, this election year could have featured a rational debate about immigration policy that went beyond xenophobia and the fear of disorder caused by the presence of immigrant day laborers on suburban street corners. Americans -- particularly those struggling to find decent jobs themselves -- have a reasonable concern about what effect the presence of so many unplanned-for workers has had on the economy. They deserved to hear that talked about in a realistic way.\n        Last month the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that wants to reduce immigration, released a study that found that a sharp immigration increase in the last five years corresponded with a steep decline in the employment of young native-born Americans, particularly black men without high school diplomas. Last week in The Times, Rachel Swarns reported on the ways the booming population of Latinos in the Deep South -- particularly Georgia -- had left many black Americans resentful of the immigrants' comparative success.\n        But there is compelling evidence that instead of harming the economy, unskilled immigrants prop it up, filling jobs that better-educated Americans do not want and giving everyone access to cheaper goods and services. The case made by the Center for Immigration Studies is rebutted by other studies that have found that there is no nationwide pattern of job displacement by illegal immigrants, and that immigration has broadly been a net plus to the nation. In Georgia, immigrant labor has kept textile mills, farms and service industries humming.\n        Right now across America, fruit is rotting on the ground because the crackdown along the border has created a shortage of immigrant workers needed for the harvest. Nevertheless, it is impossible to ignore stories of poor American workers who believe that their livelihoods were undermined by immigrants willing to work for below-subsistence wages, and of honest employers who could not compete with unscrupulous competitors using undocumented workers.\n        These serious problems will not be solved at the border with Mexico. Setting things right means adopting policies that fence-obsessed members of Congress have not exactly championed, like raising the minimum wage, improving public education, having a progressive income tax and making sure that workers' rights are protected.\n        These are only a few reasonable solutions. A host of others is offered in a new report by the Migration Policy Institute, in which Lee Hamilton, the former congressman, and Spencer Abraham, the former senator and energy secretary, argue that immigration needs to be seen as an integral element of a national economic policy. It is a resource to be embraced and managed, with a lawful, orderly flow of workers governed by flexible quotas set by a national commission advising Congress.\n        It's a comprehensive approach and then some. It offers a new way of framing a stalled debate. The wall builders have made their point, and it's a lousy one. Now it is time for those who want serious immigration reform to look beyond them.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1847702,"ids":1847702,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Congress has done a terrible job of regulating electronic voting: It allowed A.T.M.-style voting machines to proliferate without requiring them to produce a paper trail that can be audited to ensure that the results are accurate. That has meant wasted time and money for the states, confusion for voters, and questionable election results. Fortunately, the nation's delinquent lawmakers have a chance to set things right -- through a bill introduced by Representative Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, that would finally impose a paper trail requirement. There are some details that need fine-tuning, but Congress should move quickly to pass it.\n        After the 2000 election debacle, Congress gave the states large grants to replace faulty voting machines, including the kind that produced hanging chads. But in too many cases, states and localities rushed to buy electronic voting machines that do not produce paper records. Voters have to trust the numbers they spit out on election night, but the numbers cannot be independently verified, and that is unacceptable.\n        Aside from intentional vote theft -- which is not hard to do on paperless electronic voting machines -- glitches are all too common in these machines. A disturbing one that keeps occurring is ''vote flipping,'' in which machines record a vote for one candidate as a vote for his or her opponent.\n        While Congress looked the other way, many states responded to popular demand and imposed their own paper trail requirements. More than half, including such large ones as California, New York and Ohio, have adopted this critical reform. But some still have not, which means that a presidential election could be decided by votes cast on paperless electronic voting machines.\n        Mr. Holt's bill would require a voter-verified paper ballot in all federal elections, which means that every vote must be recorded on a piece of paper that the voter can examine to ensure that it was properly recorded. It would also require that a suitable percentage of the paper ballots be audited to verify the tallies produced by the machines. The bill allocates $1 billion for the upgrades, and has other important reforms, including tougher requirements for the testing labs that certify voting machines, which have been rife with conflicts of interest.\n        In the Senate, Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, is putting together a parallel bill. Hers is expected to go further in some areas, by including such reforms as barring secretaries of state, who count the votes, from participating in partisan politics, and requiring fairer procedures for purging voters from the rolls. Since Congress gets around to reforming election law so rarely, it makes sense to include these.\n        The hardest issue is likely to be deadlines. Mr. Holt would require some of the states that still do not have paper trails to put them in place for the 2008 presidential election. He is right to push them to act quickly, and to make money available as soon as possible. But some states may rightly feel that they would be inviting chaos if they rushed to comply. They should be allowed to apply for partial or full waivers, with the understanding that they still must push forward as quickly as possible.\n        Congress vowed to fix the nation's election system after the 2000 vote.

Stapled together, they could make a constructive start toward reducing this country's dependence on oil imports and its emissions of greenhouse gases.\n        The first, championed by Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici of New Mexico, has three main objectives. It seeks to reduce oil consumption by quintupling the production of biofuels -- principally ethanol from sources other than corn -- by 2022. It would mandate stronger efficiency standards for energy-intensive household appliances, including lighting fixtures and refrigerators.\n        And, perhaps most important, it would try to bring to commercial scale the government's nascent efforts to build coal-fired power plants capable of capturing and storing emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. Coal will remain the world's most plentiful fuel, and unless some way is found to neutralize its emissions, the battle to stabilize emissions is almost certainly lost.\n        The other important bill, known as the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, was approved last week and is mainly the handiwork of Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. It would raise the fuel economy standard for passenger cars from 25 to 35 miles per gallon over the next 10 years, and -- for the first time -- would require steady improvements in fuel efficiency for medium and heavy-duty trucks. The debate over fuel economy has been deadlocked for three decades, and approval of this bill would represent a major breakthrough.\n        The bills need work. There are big loopholes in the fuel economy bill that need closing, and safeguards must be built into the Bingaman-Domenici bill to make sure that forests are not plowed under in a mad rush to cultivate feedstocks for ethanol. This will require deft management by Harry Reid, the majority leader, whose task will be to open the bills to constructive amendment without triggering the feeding frenzy that energy bills usually inspire.\n        Congress must understand that these bills are not a substitute for a global warming strategy that puts a price on carbon emissions through a tax or a cap-and-trade mechanism, or a combination of both.

In fact, the polls show that the more they learn about privatization, the less they like it. And with good reason. The very real risks of privatization -- in terms of retirement security and the enormous budgetary cost to the country -- far outweigh the potential rewards.\n        So when Congressional Republican leaders tell the president that Social Security private accounts are a nonstarter, they are conveying the informed views of their constituents.\n        Mr. Bush has reacted by railing against Democrats for obstruction -- as if Democrats are duty-bound to breathe life into his agenda and, even sillier, as if opposing a plan that the people do not want is an illegitimate tactic for an opposition party.\n        Rather than accept defeat and consider alternatives, Mr. Bush is becoming even more feckless as public and political opposition mounts. On Tuesday, in a lame ploy to draw the Democrats to the table, he gave tepid approval to a proposal by Robert Bennett, the stalwart conservative senator from Utah, to restore the system's solvency in a way that would not include private accounts -- all the while saying that he was not prepared to give up private accounts.\n        Mr. Bennett's plan includes drastic and unnecessarily large cuts in Social Security benefits, but at least he is being straightforward in offering a plan that addresses the real problem Americans want solved.

The investigation appears to have been slowed before Election Day, Mr. Renzi retained his seat, and Mr. Charlton ended up out of a job -- one of eight prosecutors purged by the White House and the Justice Department.\n        The Arizona case adds a disturbing new chapter to that scandal. Congress needs to determine whether Mr. Charlton was fired for any reason other than threatening the Republican Party's hold on a Congressional seat.\n        Mr. Renzi was fighting for his political life when the local press reported that he was facing indictment for a suspect land deal. According to The Wall Street Journal, federal investigators met unexpected resistance from the Justice Department in getting approval to proceed and, perhaps as a result, the investigation was pushed past the election.\n        Mr. Renzi's top aide, Brian Murray, admitted this week that when reports surfaced that his boss was being investigated, he had called Mr. Charlton's office asking for information. Mr. Charlton's office did the right thing, according to Mr. Murray's account: it refused to comment. Weeks later, Mr. Charlton was fired.\n        There is reason to be suspicious about these events. Last week, all Attorney General Alberto Gonzales could offer was weak excuses for the firing -- that Mr. Charlton had asked Mr. Gonzales to reconsider a decision to seek the death penalty in a murder case and that he'd started recording interviews with targets of investigations without asking permission from Justice Department bureaucrats.\n        Beyond that, this story line is far too similar to one involving a fired prosecutor in New Mexico. Senator Pete Domenici, a Republican, asked the prosecutor there, David Iglesias, about the status of an investigation of prominent Democrats. If Mr. Iglesias had brought indictments before the election, it could have helped Heather Wilson, a Republican congresswoman locked in a tight re-election battle. He didn't. Mr. Domenici reportedly complained to the White House. Mr. Iglesias was fired.\n        Since this scandal broke, the White House has insisted that the firings were legitimate because United States attorneys serve ''at the pleasure of the president.'' They do. But if prosecutors were fired to block investigations, that might well be obstruction of justice, which is itself a federal crime.\n        Yesterday, Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, wrote to Mr. Gonzales to request all White House and Justice Department communications about the Renzi investigation. Given what has already come out, the burden is now on the Justice Department to show that Mr. Charlton's firing was legitimate.\n        Congress stepped up this investigation in other ways yesterday. The House authorized immunity for Monica Goodling, a former Justice Department official who has invoked her right against self-incrimination. And the Senate approved a subpoena for Sara Taylor, a top aide to Karl Rove.\n        These interviews are important, but the major players need to testify. The Senate has approved subpoenas for Mr. Rove; for Harriet Miers, who was the White House counsel; and for other officials who seem deeply involved in the firings. It is time to serve them.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1787209,"ids":1787209,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Connecticut declared war on childhood obesity this year when it became the first state to ban sugary soft drinks from public schools. It has reinforced that strategy by promising more state money to schools that agree not to sell high-fat snacks and other goodies.\n        Now it is time for Hartford to turn its attention to a far greater problem: drug use among school-age children.\n        The state's focus on obesity could do some good. A survey by the Public Health and Education Departments showed that about 11 percent of the state's children are overweight. The survey of high school and middle school students also showed that parents matter -- students whose parents know their whereabouts are 30 percent more likely to avoid premarital sex, and 50 percent more likely to avoid drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes.\n        Over all, the state concluded reassuringly, Connecticut students' health habits were not much different from those of students nationwide.\n        But there is one area in which Connecticut children are doing measurably worse than the national average. And that is drug use.\n        More high school students in Connecticut reported having smoked marijuana in the previous 30 days than had smoked tobacco: a little more than 23 percent for marijuana, 18 percent for tobacco.\n        Nearly 7 percent of Connecticut 12th graders said they had used heroin. That is more than four times the national average of 1.5 percent, as measured in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n        The percentage of Connecticut 12th graders who said they had used methamphetamines, a little more than 7 percent, is especially frightening given the addictive nature of the drug.\n        These statistics are scary, but the reality is probably worse because the researchers did not talk to school dropouts, who are more likely to use drugs than those still in school.\n        Connecticut's drug prevention programs are scattered throughout various departments, with little or no coordination. The Department of Education divides $2 million in federal drug prevention money among thousands of schools in about 180 school districts. Its impact is further diluted since schools are allowed to use 40 percent of the money for violence prevention, security or metal detectors. The State Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services spends about $9 million for prevention efforts; $8 million of this is federal money, much of it grants earmarked for specific purposes.\n        State lawmakers are more enamored of fighting obesity -- the cause of the moment -- than fighting drug use. The overwhelming majority of money spent on drug prevention comes from the federal government, and when that is cut, the state, in the past, has not replaced it.\n        If Connecticut is sincere in its desire to promote the health of the young, it will take off the blinders with regard to drug use. Drugs threaten our young people, in school and out, a lot more than do cookies and Gatorade. Banning brownies is easy. Helping the young avoid drugs requires attention, not to mention money, patience and a commitment to initiatives that are proven to work.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1793905,"ids":1793905,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Connecticut elections are blessedly free of hanging chads, the bits of paper ballots that bedeviled Florida's recount in the 2000 presidential election. But the state's mechanical voting machines are nothing to celebrate.\n        Ask Auden Grogins, a former Bridgeport councilwoman. In 2001, Ms. Grogins, then a five-term incumbent, lost her seat by 26 votes. During a recount, officials discovered that one of the machines malfunctioned, registering zero votes for her even though several people who used the machine said they cast ballots for Ms. Grogins. A court ordered a new election, which she won.\n        Or ask voters in Bethel and New London. In 2003, problems with several voting machines led to confusion and long lines on Election Day.\n        It took the 2000 debacle in Florida to persuade Congress to pass a federal law requiring changes in the way America votes. The law, and the money it provides, should help address annoying problems that have been cropping up at the state level for years.\n        The Connecticut secretary of the state, Susan Bysiewicz, will use about $15 million of the state's $32 million share to replace the old machines. The change cannot come soon enough, even though many people have a quirky kind of fondness for these dinosaurs, which have been around for about 70 years and whose operating technology is even older. The machines weigh 900 pounds apiece and require lots of work to set up and repair.\n        The new machines will be available everywhere next year; this year, 25 towns will use them. The machines will scan ballots, which are the size of a sheet of paper and have the weight of light cardboard. If a voter makes a mistake, the machine is programmed to reject the ballot immediately, so the voter can correct it on the spot.\n        It couldn't be much easier. Better yet, handicapped voters or those who need help in translating English will be able to vote through a telephone touch-tone system in the voting booth, thus making Connecticut's system more accessible to everyone.\n        Even so, the transition could be rocky without continued diligence. By state law, voter registrars are in charge of preparation for this new system. That is fine for towns with experienced officials, but it could be a challenge for others. This year's 25-town test drive should provide some idea of what needs fixing. In the meantime, Ms. Bysiewicz is to be commended for her work in moving this process forward.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1833784,"ids":1833784,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Connecticut prefers to think of itself as progressive, even enlightened. But when it comes to something as basic as dental care for the poor -- especially children -- Connecticut is in the Dark Ages. Ask Susan Thorton, a legal assistant from Winsted and the mother of three teenagers. For years her family has received dental coverage through Medicaid, also known as Husky A. The public health clinic that once took Ms. Thorton's children does not take children over 12. She has called a dozen dentists, to no avail.\n        The reason is obvious. This state is far behind states like Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina in the amount of money it will reimburse dentists who care for poor children. For lack of decent care, thousands of children here suffer because so few dentists are willing to take the state's miserly reimbursement rates. Too many poor children miss school because of toothaches; others will develop abscessed teeth because of dental neglect.\n        Seven years ago, legal aid lawyers filed a lawsuit against the state, claiming it did not provide adequate dental care to low-income children, but the case has languished. Solving this problem is fundamental; the General Assembly should act before the legislature tackles other items on its ambitious agenda, particularly broader health care reform.\n        The facts are simple. Since 1993, Connecticut has not raised Husky A dental rates. (Adults face an even worse situation; the state hasn't increased adult dental rates since 1989.) As a result, the few dentists in the state who take low-income patients almost invariably lose money -- and yet they are often overwhelmed by low-income people who are trying to see them. Only about 100 of the state's 3,000 dentists see the majority of the poor.\n        Two of these dentists, Jeanne Strathearn and her partner, Stanley Fellman, have treated Medicaid patients for years. It is common, Dr. Strathearn said, for patients to drive 60 miles, from as far away as Bridgeport, for an appointment at her office in Hartford.\n        ''Eighty percent of tooth decay is in 25 percent of the population,'' Dr. Strathearn said. Care is so difficult for the poor to obtain here that only one-third of the state's 250,000 children enrolled in Husky A get dental exams, the lowest rate in New England. That is also why, in 2004, 77,000 low-income children saw dentists on an emergency basis.\n        The legislature is considering a good bill, House Bill 7069, that would raise rates sufficiently so that an additional 300 dentists statewide would be willing to treat low-income children. The cost would be $21 million the first year. The federal government would pay half.\n        The same bill passed the necessary committees last year. But during budget negotiations between the legislature and the executive branch, the governor's office offered to settle the lawsuit to resolve the issue. The governor's office has since balked because of the cost, saying it would cost more to treat children than the bill allocates. Maybe so. Yet the reason it is expensive is that rates have stagnated for 14 years. The legislature should take no more chances. Passing the bill is a matter of compassion and common sense.","adu_anecdote":15,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1770168,"ids":1770168,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Connecticut towns and cities get two-thirds of their revenue from personal property taxes levied on almost anything that moves and some things that do not: motor vehicles, real estate and business equipment. The system is rife with inequities, with the tax rate varying widely from town to town. Three years ago, a state commission found that Connecticut had the third-highest property tax burden in the nation on a per-capita basis.\n        State legislators and the governor have been content to chisel at the system piecemeal, rather than address the big picture.\n        The tax on manufacturing equipment is a case in point. This tax makes so little sense for a state that has lost tens of thousands of blue-collar jobs that the General Assembly voted unanimously this year to phase it out.\n        Yet because towns and cities rely on this tax, however wrong-headed it may be, the move threatened to leave local governments short. Not to worry, lawmakers said. Connecticut would reimburse the towns for the lost revenue.\n        But the towns are worried. They have heard this song before. When times are good, the state keeps its word. When budgets are tight, it does not. Indeed, this is not the first time the state has made false promises about the tax on equipment.\n        In the 1990's, the state barred towns from taxing manufacturing equipment during the first five years of use and promised to make up all the lost revenue. But in 2002, facing a deficit, it changed the rules, reimbursing the towns for only 80 percent of their losses. The reimbursement dropped to 66 percent in 2004, and rose slightly to 70 percent last year.\n        This kind of fiscal roller coaster hurts cities like Bridgeport badly. Bridgeport receives $7.8 million from the tax on manufacturing equipment and is one of its main beneficiaries.\n        So towns don't trust the state government. Why should they? What is needed at the Capitol is the political will to look at the big picture. Three years ago, the report from the blue-ribbon state commission that examined property taxes outlined the negative impact of municipalities' overreliance on these taxes and suggested changes.\n        The commission was headed by New Haven's mayor, John DeStefano, who is now running for governor; its report won the support of both organized labor and business. Yet the General Assembly ducked the issue, Gov. John Rowland ignored it and the report has gathered dust ever since.\n        Connecticut should keep its latest promise to reimuburse towns. Then it should tackle the underlying issue, which is property tax reform. It is an issue that deserves more from state officials than cherry-picking.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1768473,"ids":1768473,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Connecticut's eight-year experiment with electric deregulation has not delivered on its promise of lower prices and customer choice. Instead, prices have soared, competition never materialized and the only people who are happy are owners and shareholders of electric generators, many of which are making record profits. In response, the General Assembly held hearings in mid-May and last Monday to consider solutions, among them a bill that's a good first step toward fixing what is broken.\n        The state cannot afford to wait until next year. The General Assembly should pass the proposed bill in special session, before campaign season starts in earnest, to provide long-term relief for residents and businesses burdened by the cost of power.\n        Connecticut deregulated its electric industry in 1998 with high hopes. Many believed that the competitive market, unshackled, would lower energy costs. Proponents advocated the sale of generators, especially the state's two pricey nuclear power plants. Lawmakers passed a highly technical, 160-page bill that few understood, which upended the status quo. Then everyone waited for the brave new world of lower prices to unfold.\n        They're still waiting. Nuclear power is a bargain for the first time in history, but alas, the state's plants have been sold. Connecticut has the fourth-highest electrical rates in the country, behind Massachusetts, Hawaii and New Hampshire. Many predict further rate increases for electricity of 20 percent to 40 percent before year's end.\n        Because the state no longer regulates its own electric market, ratepayers have no cushion. The market rules are set by ISO New England, the organization responsible for the reliability of the region's electric grid, and are approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Neither has paid much heed to consumers. Instead, they have added hundreds of millions of dollars to monthly bills in the form of congestion charges and huge incentives for generators to run their plants when demand peaks.\n        The rules also peg power prices to the costs of natural gas and oil, the most expensive sources available, even if some of the state's electricity comes from lower-cost generators. It's enough to make one long for the age of kerosene lamps.\n        The proposed legislation would give the state more control. It would allow state utilities to get back in the generation business in a limited way, to provide lower-cost power when demand is high and provide a stronger voice for consumers. It should include a provision to make sure that all ratepayer funds for conservation go for energy-saving initiatives and are not diverted for other purposes, as often happens now.\n        Some argue for a windfall profits tax on the most profitable generators. But that is a measure of last resort, a step no other state has taken. Right now, the state needs to get a grip on energy costs.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1818737,"ids":1818737,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Connecticut's prison population, at 19,000, is inching up toward record levels, reversing a trend of slight reductions over the last two years. Incarcerating people in overcrowded facilities is inhumane and always expensive: it costs $29,500 a year to imprison each person. This problem did not develop overnight. The prison population rose steadily from the late 1980s until 2003. And the recent increase is not surprising, especially in light of last year's rising crime rate. But the important thing to remember is that prison is not an answer to crime; bigger prison populations reflect society's failure to find answers.\n        The state needs to walk a difficult tightrope: reducing the number of inmates in prison while keeping dangerous offenders off the streets. The Department of Correction is trying to make things better, and in time its actions will bear fruit. But ultimately the problem is bigger than any one agency can cope with.\n        The most effective intervention takes place years before a person enters the legal system. That is clear from two statistics: Eighty five percent of those Connecticut inmates have substance abuse problems at the time of arrest; a staggering three-quarters are high school dropouts. In response, the Department of Correction gives addiction treatment to the vast majority of inmates and gives out more high school equivalency diplomas than any other institution in Connecticut.\n        But more should be done before a person enters prison. Making preschool programs widely available for the poor, as Gov. M. Jodi Rell has proposed, would have the long-term effect of increasing employment and reducing the incidence of incarceration years later. Improving schools in Connecticut's cities would have much the same salubrious effect.\n        There are also a range of shorter-term measures that could relieve prison overcrowding. Of the more than 19,000 people behind bars, about one-quarter -- or nearly 5,000 inmates -- are awaiting trial, a larger proportion than usual. Of these, according to Representative Michael Lawlor, the Democratic co-chairman of the legislature's Judiciary Committee, about 1,000 are indigent and pose little threat to the public, yet they are being held because they cannot post bond for amounts as low as $500 or $1,000. It makes no sense to keep them incarcerated; the taxpayers spend more money in less than two weeks to feed and house them than the bail necessary to obtain their release.\n        Then there are the more than 400 inmates who are teenagers -- 14- to 17-year-olds who, because of their crimes and Connecticut's misguided ''get tough'' philosophy for youngsters, are serving time in prison along with adults. Connecticut is one of the few states to mix the two age groups for serious crimes. Housing young people with career criminals is bad public policy. Continuing the status quo when prisons are overcrowded makes even less sense. The current conditions add urgency to the need to house young offenders in separate facilities, and not treat them as adults.\n        Connecticut prisons may be overcrowded, but building more of them is the last thing we need. Thoughtful solutions exist for overcrowding. But the best solutions keep people from being sent to prison in the first place.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1804259,"ids":1804259,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Corporate profits are at record levels. The Dow, too, has climbed past its high-water mark from the dot-com era. Executives reap bigger and bigger paydays, even as wages have stagnated. Meanwhile, the widening investigation into stock-option backdating reminds us that the corporate malfeasance era was much more than just a couple of bad apples like Enron and WorldCom.\n        It seems almost unbelievable, then, that corporate America would pick this moment to beg for relaxed regulation and enforcement, as well as more protection from investors' lawsuits. But as Stephen Labaton reported recently in The Times, industry groups are seeking broad new protections for corporations and accounting firms, not through legislation but from the Bush administration through agency rule changes.\n        The rationale is that the high cost of complying with the corporate governance law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, along with runaway lawsuits have scared foreign companies away from American stock exchanges. The timing is particularly odd given that the compliance costs associated with the much-reviled Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley -- which requires audits of companies' internal financial controls -- fell last year, as did the number of investor lawsuits, for the second year in a row.\n        What has actually happened is that opponents of regulation believe that the coast is clear. The law's namesakes, Paul Sarbanes and Michael Oxley, are retiring. Kenneth Lay of Enron is dead. The time appears ripe for rollbacks.\n        Advocates of big business like to point to a sharp decline in the United States' share of global initial stock offerings between 2000 and 2005, hoping that everyone will infer that the cause was the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002. In fact, that share had been declining since 1996, even before the Asian financial crisis. It hit bottom in 2001 and has risen since.\n        United States markets lost their dominance of initial stock offerings for numerous reasons that had little to do with regulation. Some of last year's biggest deals were Chinese and French privatizations. Markets elsewhere are bigger and more liquid than they once were. There are also intangibles, such as America's recent unpopularity, increased barriers for visa seekers and extraordinary budget and trade deficits, which might make an issuer think twice about a dollar-denominated stock.\n        The London Stock Exchange, one of the leading beneficiaries of the American decline, commissioned a study showing that underwriting fees in London are just 3 percent to 4 percent of a transaction, compared with an average of 6.5 percent to 7 percent in the United States.\n        When workers confront globalization, they are told to adapt, take their pink slips and go to night school. It is the harsh downside of an integrated world economy that has on balance significantly enriched the country. When financiers feel the pinch from competition in Hong Kong and London, they run to the Bush administration for rule changes.\n        America's investor protections and corporate regulations have made it a nation of share owners, with almost 57 million American households owning stocks either directly or through mutual funds. The Securities and Exchange Commission has already signaled that it will smooth the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley, especially for smaller companies. And abuses of the private litigation system like pay-to-play should be stopped. There is room for reform. But over all, the system is working. It may need tweaks, but it does not need a revamping.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1644772,"ids":1644772,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Could the Palestinians finally be figuring out how to get what they want?\n        It's a sign of how low the expectations are for Mideast peace that we wanted to publish this editorial about a possible cease-fire in Gaza as soon as we could, lest the possible cease-fire be broken before we could congratulate those who agreed to it. We hope that the Palestinian militant groups that say they are suspending attacks on Israel for a while actually do so. We hope that suspension takes hold, and leads to a broader, long-term cease-fire, not just in Gaza, but also in the West Bank and Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. And we hope this puts the region back on the road to peace.\n        Of course, we hope for much in the Mideast, and both sides, but particularly the Palestinians, are notorious for dashing those hopes. Still, Mahmoud Abbas, the new Palestinian leader, is saying and doing the right things. Unlike his predecessor, Yasir Arafat, Mr. Abbas is cracking down on violence. He has ordered Palestinian security forces to fan out in northern Gaza to prevent militants from firing their homemade rockets and mortars at the Israelis. He has called such attacks ''useless,'' and urged Palestinians to stop their intifada against Israel, which anyone with good sense knows has hurt the Palestinians even more than the Israelis. And Mr. Abbas is now negotiating with groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades. He is apparently closing in on a commitment from Hamas and Islamic Jihad for a monthlong truce. He should be cautious about what he offers in return, especially power sharing in the Palestinian Authority.\n        If this truce does indeed take hold, it will be by far the second smartest thing -- after electing Mr. Abbas as their leader -- that the Palestinians have done in years. Mr. Abbas deserves credit as the only real Palestinian leader who candidly acknowledges what the world has always known. Palestinian violence against Israel is pointless, and has served only to bring forth overwhelmingly punishing responses. From the start of the intifada, back in 2000, Mr. Abbas warned that it was counterproductive, and that years of pointless carnage later, Palestinians would be back at square one, except poorer, more tired, held in lower esteem by the world. In addition, Palestinian violence cost the Palestinians something they dearly need if they will ever get a state they can live with: American support. Without Washington pushing from behind, it is doubtful that the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, will go anywhere near a negotiating table.\n        So here we are, back at square one. But this time, the man at the helm on the Palestinian side is so far making all the right moves. It would be nice to see the Palestinians, after years of shooting themselves in the foot, actually start playing the game like people who expect to win. Mr. Abbas is doing so, and his people would do well to listen to, and then heed, his advice.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":4,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1646349,"ids":1646349,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Courageous Iraqis turned out to vote yesterday in numbers that may have exceeded even the most optimistic predictions. Participation varied by region, and the impressive national percentages should not obscure the fact that the country's large Sunni Arab minority remained broadly disenfranchised -- due to alienation or terror or both. But even in some predominantly Sunni areas, turnout was higher than expected. And in an impressive range of mainly Shiite and Kurdish cities, a long silenced majority of ordinary Iraqis defied threats of deadly mayhem to cast votes for a new, and hopefully democratic, political order.\n        That is a message that all but the most nihilistic of the armed insurgents will have to accept. Many fierce political struggles lie ahead. Yet all who claim to be fighting in the name of the Iraqi people should now recognize that -- in an open expression of popular will -- Iraqis have expressed their clear preference that these battles be fought exclusively in the peaceful, constitutional arena.\n        This page has not hesitated to criticize the Bush administration over its policies in Iraq, and we continue to have grave doubts about the overall direction of American strategy there. Yet today, along with other Americans, whether supporters or critics of the war, we rejoice in a heartening advance by the Iraqi people. For now at least, the multiple political failures that marked the run-up to the voting stand eclipsed by a remarkably successful election day.\n        But once the votes are fully counted and the new governing and constitution-writing bodies begin their work, those errors, particularly the needless estrangement of mainstream Sunni Arabs and their political leaders, must be urgently addressed. In the longer run, this election can only be counted as a success if it helps lead to a unified Iraq that avoids civil war and attracts a broad enough range of Iraqis to defend itself against its enemies without requiring long-term and substantial American military help.\n        That day has now become easier to envision. But it still appears very far off. It's impossible to say, in the glow of election day, how many of the millions of Iraqis who voted did so in hopes that they were making the first step toward a Shiite theocracy. Many -- though certainly not all -- Shiite leaders have said repeatedly that that they want to work toward an inclusive secular state in which all groups have a stake. What happens next will depend to a considerable extent on the wisdom and restraint the largely Shiite victors show in reaching out to Sunnis who have felt unfairly marginalized. Detaching the Sunni mainstream from the hard-core terrorists is clearly the most critical challenge of the weeks ahead. Kurdish leaders will also need to demonstrate that they and their followers are committed to a future as Iraqi citizens, not members of a breakaway state.\n        Sunni political leaders have their own challenge to meet, and other Iraqis will be waiting to see how they respond to the election results. Their calls to boycott were only partially heeded. For many Sunni voters, the opportunity to participate in the most meaningful and legitimate election Iraq has seen in at least half a century proved more compelling than their sectarian grievances. Those voters, along with the millions of other Sunnis who sat on the sidelines, need Sunni political leaders to fight fiercely but peacefully on their behalf for a fair share of Iraq's legislative and constitutional power.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1710770,"ids":1710770,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Critics of Georgia's new voter-identification law, which forces many citizens to pay $20 or more for the documentation necessary to vote, have called it a modern-day poll tax, intended to keep blacks and poor people from voting.

Under the new law, voters with driver's licenses were not inconvenienced. But it put up huge obstacles for voters without licenses, who are disproportionately poor and black. Most of them would have to get official state picture-identification cards and pay processing fees of $20 or more. Incredibly -- beyond the cost imposed on such voters -- there was not a single office in Atlanta where the identification cards were for sale.\n        Republicans claimed the law was intended to prevent fraud, but that was just a pretext. According to Georgia's secretary of state, Cathy Cox, in recent years there have been no documented cases of fraud through voter impersonation. There have been complaints about the misuse of absentee ballots, Ms. Cox says, but the new law actually loosened the antifraud protections that apply to them. Clearly, Georgia Republicans supported the law because they believed that making it harder for blacks and poor people to vote would help their electoral chances.\n        The League of Women Voters of Georgia, the N.A.A.C.P. and other civil rights and voting rights groups sued. In a lengthy and hard-hitting opinion, Judge Harold Murphy of Federal District Court enjoined the state from enforcing the law. He relied in part on the 24th Amendment, which banned the old racist requirement that citizens pay poll taxes before being allowed to vote in federal elections.\n        At least one Georgia state senator is vowing to appeal, if necessary, all the way to the Supreme Court. That would send an ugly message about the state of American democracy. In the civil rights era, Southern states had to be told again and again by federal courts not to try to stop their black citizens from voting. It is shameful that in 2005, Georgia needs to be told again.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1829069,"ids":1829069,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Debate over a new vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and genital warts has reached a high pitch. State legislatures are debating whether to mandate the vaccine or insist that its use be kept voluntary. The manufacturer stopped a vigorous lobbying campaign lest it provoke more opposition than support. And some health professionals who had been championing the vaccine flinched at making it mandatory, at least for now.\n        Even so, state legislatures should require that all young girls be given this vaccine, which protects against a virus that causes some 10,000 new cases of cervical cancer in the United States each year -- and 3,700 cancer deaths.\n        Three weeks ago we applauded Gov. Rick Perry for making Texas the first state to require vaccinating young schoolgirls -- ages 11 and 12 -- against the human papillomavirus. In the ensuing uproar, the Texas House has moved to overturn his order, but the Virginia Legislature has approved a similar mandate. Some 20 states have bills pending to require the vaccinations for school attendance.\n        We have endorsed a mandate because the vaccine -- Merck's Gardasil -- looks highly effective against strains that cause 70 percent of all cervical cancer. With more than two million doses already distributed, the reported side effects have been mostly minor, such as dizziness or fainting. Many parents who oppose a mandate are aghast at the thought of vaccinating such young girls against a sexually transmitted disease. But the vaccine works only if taken before a girl becomes infected. Social conservatives object that the vaccine will encourage promiscuity, but it seems farfetched to believe that protection from cervical cancer will change any girl's behavior. Others complain that a mandate will pre-empt parental rights to make health decisions, but all vaccine mandates do that, to protect the children and those they might infect.\n        The strongest arguments against moving ahead quickly tend to be practical and financial. States have typically used school mandates for vaccines that are already in wide use, and it is possible that unexpected side effects could emerge (though any mandate could be suspended if that happened). Health professionals also need to be certain that there are stable supplies, adequate insurance coverage, ample public money to vaccinate low-income children and physician support.\n        Merck deserves praise for developing Gardasil at a time when many companies shun the vaccine business as risky and unprofitable. But it is charging $360 for a three-dose regimen, a price that might come down if a competing vaccine enters the market soon, as expected.\n        The vaccine could prevent thousands of new cases of cervical cancer annually and hundreds of thousands of cases of genital warts and precancerous growths. A mandate would force the health care system to get cracking. And it is the best way to ensure that all children get the vaccine, not just those who are aware of it and can afford it.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1787226,"ids":1787226,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Democratic voters in the 19th Congressional District, which contains all of Putnam and parts of Orange, Rockland, Dutchess and Westchester counties, have the luxury of choosing from a roster of appealing candidates in their party's primary election on Sept. 12.\n        Four Democrats are seeking to topple Sue Kelly, a Republican who has held the seat since 1994. The youngest is Ben Shuldiner, 29, the founder and principal of the High School for Public Service, a small public academy in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, that requires pupils to supplement their studies with community volunteer work. Mr. Shuldiner, from Crompond, in Westchester, embodies his school's brash idealism. He has drawn on that experience and his own medical history (he has hemophilia) to make education and health care the focus of his energetic campaign.\n        Darren Rigger, 36, a political consultant and fund-raiser from Peekskill, has built his race around a targeted appeal to union members and African-American and Latino voters, making his a welcome voice in this increasingly diverse district. He has distinguished himself by stressing the need for comprehensive reform of the nation's immigration system, an issue of critical importance -- and controversy -- in the suburbs.\n        Mr. Shuldiner and Mr. Rigger are good candidates, but in searching for the one with the experience and depth to represent the district in Congress, the choice narrows to two: Judy Aydelott, a lawyer from Katonah, and John Hall, a musician and music producer from Dover Plains.\n        Mr. Hall, 57, was the lead singer of the 1970's soft-rock group Orleans and he has long blended politics and environmentalism into his music career, having helped to organize the ''No Nukes'' concerts of 1979 and written songs like ''Power,'' an ode to alternative energy. He served a term on the Ulster County Legislature and spent three years on the Board of Education in Saugerties, where he also helped write the town's first zoning law.\n        Ms. Aydelott is a convert to Democratic politics, a former Republican who switched registration three years ago after becoming disenchanted with the party over the Iraq war. A malpractice lawyer who lived as a military spouse when her husband was in the Navy, she speaks with particular passion about veterans issues.\n        Both Ms. Aydelott and Mr. Hall have called for a withdrawal from Iraq and a ''moon shot'' commitment to energy independence. Each has a plan for the much-derided Indian Point nuclear plant -- he would shut it down and turn it into a center for alternative energy; she would convert it to a plant powered by natural gas. Each favors universal health coverage. He wants a single-payer national plan; she has not put forth a specific proposal, but has pledged not to accept Congressional health benefits until all Americans are covered.\n        Mr. Hall may be best known for the songs ''Still the One'' and ''Dance With Me'' and the hairy-chested album cover he posed for in his Orleans era. But he deserves respect as a long-time Democratic activist who has drawn attention beyond his celebrity status as an articulate and forceful voice for his party's ideals. Ms. Aydelott, a more low-key presence, has equally solid credentials and a convincing message that should resonate well in this moderate district, where she has lived all her life. Her deep roots here help to make her a compellingly well-rounded candidate, and she wins our endorsement.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":4,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1806815,"ids":1806815,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Democrats who ran for Congress this fall made the cost of college a big campaign issue. Now that they've won control of the House and Senate, they can prepare to act swiftly on at least some of the factors that have priced millions of poor and working-class Americans right out of higher education. The obvious first step would be to boost the value of the federal Pell Grant program -- a critical tool in keeping college affordable that the federal government has shamefully ceased to fund at a level that meets the national need.\n        But larger Pell Grants can't solve this crisis alone. Policy changes will also be required in the states, where public universities have been choking off college access and upward mobility for the poor by shifting away from the traditional need-based aid formula to a so-called merit formula that heavily favors affluent students. The resulting drop in the fortunes of even high-performing low-income students -- many of whom no longer attend college at all -- is documented in an eye-opening report released recently by the Education Trust, a nonpartisan foundation devoted to education reform.\n        The public universities were founded on the premise that they would provide broad access in exchange for taxpayer subsidies. That compact has been pretty much discarded in the state flagship campuses, which have increasingly come to view themselves as semiprivate colleges that define themselves not by inclusion, but by how many applicants they turn away, and how many of their students perform at the highest levels on the SAT, an index that clearly favors affluent teenagers who attend the best schools and have access to tutors.\n        The flagship schools compete for high-income, high-achieving students who would otherwise attend college elsewhere, while overlooking low-income students who are perfectly able to succeed at college but whose options are far more narrow.\n        In recent years, aid to students whose families earn over $100,000 has more than quadrupled at the public flagship and research universities. Incredibly, the average institutional grant to students from high-income families is actually larger than the average grant to low- or middle-income families.\n        Partly as a result, high-performing students from low-income groups are much less likely to attend college than their high-income counterparts -- and are less likely to ever get four-year degrees if they do attend.\n        These are ominous facts at a time when the college degree has become the basic price of admission to both the middle class and the new global economy. Unless the country reverses this trend, upward mobility through public higher education will pretty much come to a halt.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1799883,"ids":1799883,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Despite being twice rebuffed by the Senate, President Bush has named Richard Stickler, a stolid mining industry careerist, to run the mine safety agency whose serial ineptitude has been laid bare this year by the deaths of 42 mineworkers. Waiting until the Senate left town for the elections, Mr. Bush resorted to a recess appointment to place Mr. Stickler at the heart of enforcing new safety reforms that, in earlier hearings, the appointee himself had claimed were not at all that necessary.\n        To the contrary, these reforms became a crying need brought home to the nation from the depths of the Sago mine disaster in West Virginia, where 12 workers died in January. Sago presented a clinic in failed government oversight. The new law would double a miner's emergency oxygen to two hours; mandate electronic devices to track trapped miners; and repair the damage originally done by the administration in cutting more than 200 mine safety inspectors in the name of budget economy.\n        Mr. Stickler points to his six years as Pennsylvania mine safety chief to rebut criticism that he is the latest example in the administration's dangerous history of packing safety agencies with pro-industry regulators. But the bulk of his career was in corporate management of mines. Miners and lawmakers have cited the federal agency's own data in warning that injury rates at his mines were higher than the national average. The administration's pro-industry tack is a running scandal exemplified by Steven Griles, a mining lobbyist who was appointed deputy secretary of the interior. Mr. Griles devoted four years to rolling back mine regulations and then returned to lobbying for an industry long known for its patronage clout with politicians.\n        Senate opposition to Mr. Stickler reached the point that the nomination was twice withheld.

For those who don't, the House Republicans who voted last week to gut federal support of public broadcasting -- from ''Sesame Street'' to well beyond -- are offering a graphic demonstration as they attack one of the nation's more valued institutions. The Appropriations Committee voted not only to end taxpayers' support for next year's children's shows on public radio and television (yes, ''Clifford the Big Red Dog'' and ''Postcards from Buster,'' too), but also to close out entirely the $400 million in federal support of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting -- the aid funnel to local stations -- across the next two years.\n        A decade ago, Newt Gingrich tried a similar stratagem to ''zero out'' public broadcasting as Republicans claimed there was liberal bias in programming. The attempt failed in the face of cooler legislative heads and the proven indispensability of public broadcasting. This time, the Republicans' campaign is more threatening since it amounts to a second front in the culture war agenda identified with Kenneth Tomlinson, the Republican who is now chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Mr. Tomlinson is intent on ramming partisan ''balance'' on the airwaves -- read that as dragging public broadcasting over to the right -- by stocking the corporation with G.O.P. loyalists. In the next few weeks, the corporation's Republican-dominated board is expected to choose a former co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee as president of the corporation.\n        Mr. Tomlinson has said he is concerned about the cuts and will ''make the case'' for federal support. But he is in an awkward position, with his own objectivity more in question than Big Bird's or Buster's. Federal money amounts to 15 percent of public broadcasting's budget revenues, but it plays a larger and particularly crucial role for smaller rural stations. More than government support, the public's faith and donations could be threatened if audiences sense the Republicans are succeeding with an ideological putsch.\n        Republican lawmakers insist that the budget cuts are only one of many sacrifices required for fiscal discipline -- a truly laughable contention from a Congress that has broken all records for deficit spending and borrowing. The pending highway bill alone has 3,800 pet projects (cue Porky Pig, not Oscar the Grouch). These include $2 billion-plus for two ludicrous ''bridges to nowhere'' in rural Alaska, where, incidentally, station officials say public broadcasting may fade from the air unless the Senate blocks the House's spiteful cuts.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1659244,"ids":1659244,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Don't be fooled by the location of the United States Treasury, right next door to the White House. The department has suffered a steady diminution of prestige and influence during the Bush administration, starting with the unceremonious firing of its first Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, less than two years into the job, in part for suggesting that deficits do, in fact, matter.\n        Things have been downhill ever since. Last December, Republican power brokers made no bones about wanting to oust the current Treasury secretary, John Snow, only to find that the administration couldn't entice anyone better to take the job. Of course, it is always difficult to lure people with Hamiltonian intellect, expertise and reputation away from the private sector. But Mr. Bush has a particularly hard time doing so.\n        The reason in large measure is that from the start of his administration, tax policy and economic policy -- the purview of the Treasury -- have been handmaids to politics and ideology emanating from the White House. Without the clear-cut opportunity to drive policy making, the best and the brightest aren't exactly clamoring for jobs at Treasury. And Mr. Snow is still in his post, reprising his first-term performance as cheerleader for Mr. Bush's tax cuts in his current role as salesperson for Mr. Bush's misbegotten plan to privatize Social Security.\n        Meanwhile, vacancies are piling up. The post of deputy secretary, the No. 2 job, has been vacant for nearly two months, and the first-choice candidate recently removed his name from consideration. The post of under secretary for domestic finance, the Treasury's main liaison with Wall Street and the person responsible for issuance of the federal debt, has been open all year. The job of assistant secretary for tax policy has also gone unfilled this year, a disturbing absence at a time when the president is calling for comprehensive tax reform. And on Monday, the under secretary for international affairs, the person who coordinates with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and steps in when a country like Argentina or Brazil teeters on collapse, announced his resignation effective April 22.\n        The United States faces unprecedented financial risks, uncertainties and challenges, right now. The interplay of our federal budget deficit with our record deficits in trade and global transactions has become the focus of the international financial community, with repercussions for the dollar, inflation, interest rates and economic growth.\n        The clear lack of a deep bench from which to fill vacancies is cause for alarm, as is the extent to which our complex economic problems are beyond the ken of a mostly political, loyalist band of policy makers. That alarm, insistent though not yet overwhelming, would quickly reach deafening proportions if the United States were forced to respond to a sudden, destabilizing event like 9\/11 without a credible Treasury team.\n        To attract the people the Treasury needs, the White House must assure the best candidates that they will exercise true power and influence. The administration must also work in good faith, and with all due speed, to reach consensus with the Senate on its Treasury nominees, which would streamline the confirmation process and, in so doing, begin to restore the Treasury to its vital place and function.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1852329,"ids":1852329,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Dr. Jack Kevorkian -- a k a ''Doctor Death'' for helping chronically ill and terminally ill patients commit suicide -- has emerged from prison as deluded and unrepentant as ever. Brushing aside criticism by other supporters of medically assisted suicide that his tactics were reckless and harmful to their cause, Dr. Kevorkian asserted: ''I did it right. I didn't care what they did or didn't do. When I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it right.''\n        The irony, of course, is that he did it wrong, and in performing assisted suicides so badly, he besmirched the movement he hoped to energize. If his antics provided anything of value, it was as a reminder of how much terminally ill patients can suffer and of the need for sane and humane laws allowing carefully regulated assisted suicides.\n        Dr. Kevorkian first drew national attention in 1990 when he hooked up a 54-year-old Alzheimer's patient to his homemade suicide machine and watched as she pushed a button to release lethal drugs. By the time he was jailed nine years later, he claimed to have helped more than 130 terminally ill or chronically ill patients take their own lives.\n        What tripped him up was his ego and a limitless appetite for publicity. In a procedure that was taped to be shown later on national television, he gave the lethal injections to a 52-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease -- thereby moving beyond assisted suicide to euthanasia.\n        He challenged prosecutors to indict him, apparently hoping the trial would provide a showcase for arguing his cause. But the judge blocked any testimony from family members who supported the death and disallowed evidence about the patient's suffering and consent as irrelevant in a murder trial. The jury found the doctor guilty of second-degree murder.\n        The fundamental flaw in Dr. Kevorkian's crusade was his cavalier, indeed reckless, approach. He was happy to hook up patients without long-term knowledge of their cases or any corroborating medical judgment that they were terminally ill or suffering beyond hope of relief with aggressive palliative care. This was hardly ''doing it right'' as Dr. Kevorkian likes to believe.\n        By contrast, Oregon, which has the only law allowing terminally ill adults to request a lethal dose of drugs from a physician, requires two physicians to agree that the patient is of sound mind and has less than six months to live. Now California is about to vote on a similarly careful measure. One of its sponsors cites Dr. Kevorkian as ''the perfect reason we need this law in California. We don't want there to be more Dr. Kevorkians.''","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1663665,"ids":1663665,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Driving around Long Island in a hatchback Honda gives the feeling of being a tiny shrew in the late Cretaceous Period.

Our houses and cars are bigger, and we are sinking ever more dollars into running air-conditioners, computers, cellphone charges, home theaters, hot tubs and spas, even second refrigerators. Levittown, the report suggests, was a barren Sparta compared with the technological Babylon we live in now.\n        This is a national and global issue, not just a Long Island one, although it seems that the discussion locally is confined to op-ed columnists and the usual cohort of tree-huggers talking among themselves. Most lawmakers -- certainly a majority in Congress -- seem content to dismiss conservation as one of those virtues, like faith and charity, that are highly resistant to a regulatory approach.\n        But out-of-control energy use is, after all, the demon that lurks behind the hot debates about a liquefied natural gas operation in the middle of Long Island Sound, windmills off the South Shore and the relicensing of the Indian Point nuclear plant on the Hudson River. In the absence of political leadership, there should be something the committed citizen can do about it.\n        There is, actually. Long Islanders can enroll in LIPA's new Green Choice program, and choose to devote half or all of a monthly electric bill to buying power from marketers that sell energy from renewable sources: wind farms, hydroelectric plants and biomass operations, which burn methane gas from landfills and agricultural waste products. Customers who are not ready or inclined to install solar panels or geothermal heat pumps can support clean, renewable energy with their cash. They will pay a premium -- about $7 to $12 a month or more, LIPA estimates -- but as more people enroll, the utility says, prices may drop as the market conditions for green power improve.\n        It's a small gesture, and mostly symbolic. But on Long Island, so hungry for power and with so far to go in the clean-energy game, small gestures are a worthy start.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1680345,"ids":1680345,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"During a joint press conference last December, President Bush praised the visiting Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, for prosecuting ''those who would inflict harm and pain'' on the Pakistani people.

At a time when Pakistan is supposed to be going after Al Qaeda terrorists who make merry within the country's borders, our colleague Nicholas Kristof reports that Mr. Musharraf's government has instead arrested a victim of sanctioned gang rape for planning a visit to the United States. Mukhtaran Bibi was sentenced by a tribal council to be gang-raped because her younger brother supposedly had relations with a woman from a higher caste. After the rape by four men, she was forced by village leaders to walk home nearly naked in front of a jeering crowd.\n        Ms. Mukhtaran was unbowed.

But before she could get here, General Musharraf's government arrested her. Pakistan also released her attackers, who had been in prison since they were convicted of raping her. Pakistani newspapers report that the government, bizarrely, is worried that Ms. Mukhtaran might malign Pakistan's image if she is allowed to go abroad -- as if it has not taken care of that rather ably by itself.\n        The Bush administration has made nice with General Musharraf in the joint interest of antiterrorism campaigns. Christine Rocca, the assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, said in Congressional testimony yesterday that America is ''dismayed'' at the abuse of Ms. Mukhtaran, and that administration officials would pursue the matter during the course of the day. Let us hope this one goes straight up to Ms. Rocca's boss, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. It makes no sense for the United States to accept the kind of behavior from friends that it would not tolerate from enemies.\n        Being allies with Pakistan should go beyond just selling F-16 fighter jets to General Musharraf in the hope that he will one day get serious about finding Osama bin Laden and stop allowing recruiters for the Taliban to operate in Pakistan.

Those imports ended in late May 2003 after mad cow disease was discovered in a Canadian cow. Since then, Canada has discovered three more cases of the disease. The United States Department of Agriculture argues that there is a ''very low'' or ''minimal'' risk in reopening the border to live cattle under 30 months of age and to certain cuts of beef. But that argument is based on a hope and a wish.\n        In pressing to reopen the border, Mr. Cebull writes in his injunction, the U.S.D.A. has made ''a decision that subjects the entire U.S. beef industry to potentially catastrophic damages and that presents a genuine risk of death for U.S. customers.'' The Senate has endorsed this position, and the House is planning to introduce legislation. President Bush has vowed to veto any bill that keeps the border closed.\n        Mr. Bush believes in open trade borders, but in this case his thinking stumbles into an obvious pothole. Mr. Bush wants Japan to reopen its border to American beef. Japan won't do so unless America can prove it's free of mad cow disease. Yet the president is trying to force open the border with Canada, which can't prove that its herd is free of disease.\n        But the future of the beef trade with Japan worries us less than the safety of the American meat supply. Canada can't send cows across the border, but it is allowed to ship packaged meat. So Canadians have been building new slaughterhouses and selling low-priced boxed beef to American markets.\n        The only responsible way to resume international trade in beef is to ensure the health of the cattle. And the only way to do that is to test the cattle -- all of them, if need be -- and to bring a categorical end to the feeding practices that can spread mad cow disease. The Agriculture Department can cling, if it likes, to the notion of unproven ''minimal risk.'' But all it takes is one sick cow to shut down a border. It doesn't get much more minimal than that.\n        It's hard to fathom what would happen to the beef business in this country if a single case of the human version of mad cow disease were discovered and attributed to eating Canadian or American beef.

This is largely because the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, failed to vigorously pursue questions about cardiac safety and the Food and Drug Administration acquiesced in its feeble efforts. Both either ignored or tried to silence scientists who raised the alarm.\n        Avandia was approved for use in 1999 based on studies showing that it lowered blood glucose levels in patients suffering from Type 2 diabetes. At the time, the F.D.A.'s medical reviewer called for a postmarketing study to address cardiovascular risks. The company's response was a study that looked primarily at long-term control of blood sugar -- a potential plus in marketing the drug -- and only glancingly at cardiac risks. Only because European regulators insisted on a more comprehensive study did the company start one. But experts believe even that study -- which is still under way -- isn't well designed to provide meaningful answers.\n        So what's going on here? One disturbing possibility is that Glaxo has designed tests that have the effect of meeting the company's marketing objectives while minimizing risks. The F.D.A. may have allowed itself to be outmaneuvered, approving designs that won't fully answer key safety questions.\n        There are two suspected problems with Avandia. One is heart failure, where the heart gradually loses its ability to pump sufficient blood. That side effect has long been recognized. But an F.D.A. drug safety officer told The Times that she was rebuked and removed from assessing the drug last year after urging a black box warning, the agency's strongest. The agency has now requested such a warning.\n        The other, more troublesome, issue is the risk of sudden heart attacks. Here, too, there were early signals of a potential problem, raised both by the F.D.A.'s own reviewer and an outside authority, Dr. John Buse, who is about to become president of the American Diabetes Association. In 1999, when he was still a junior academic, Dr. Buse warned about possible cardiac danger only, he says, to have a high company official call his supervisor, castigate him as a liar and make veiled threats of a huge lawsuit. Now, after further signals of possible danger and a m\u00e9lange of conflicting studies, the F.D.A. plans to present the issue to a panel of experts.\n        At this point, no one is sure whether the heart attack risks from Avandia are significant. The clearest lesson is that the F.D.A. needs the power to demand adequate postmarketing studies and the resources to analyze the results. That would not guarantee that the regulators, who have too cozy a relationship with manufacturers, would act as vigorously as needed, but it would increase the odds.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1785808,"ids":1785808,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Eliot Spitzer stands so tall this election season that some New Yorkers might be excused for thinking he is governor already. (The deeply receding profile of Gov. George Pataki makes that a lot easier.) But there are two elections between the attorney general and the governor's office, the first being the Democratic primary on Sept. 12.\n        Democratic voters are being asked to choose between Mr. Spitzer and the Nassau County executive, Thomas Suozzi, for a nominee for governor. With little money or statewide notice, Mr. Suozzi is running his hard-fought campaign against enormous odds, and this is a lopsided contest. Nevertheless, this is one of those rare races in which the electorate cannot lose. Both men have excellent records. Mr. Suozzi has made impressive strides turning around a troubled Nassau County government. Mr. Spitzer has so revitalized the attorney general's office in Albany that he has become a national hero.\n        When Mr. Spitzer took over his current job in 1999 (from one of the least effective attorneys general in New York history), he started off right. He hired a top-flight team of lawyers and specialists, which served him well when the Bush administration arrived and began dismantling federal protections for consumers and the environment. He took on the biggest investment banks, insurance companies and mutual funds, which were favoring their big clients and shorting ordinary investors and small businesses. But Mr. Suozzi was earlier in recognizing that New York's state government is a mess and that its irresponsibility threatens local governments as well. And unlike the vast majority of politicians who complain that Albany needs fixing, he did something about it, risking his own political capital to back candidates against entrenched incumbent state legislators. That kind of gumption is rarer than any other political virtue in New York. If Mr. Suozzi loses his bid for the nomination for governor, it will be a terrible loss for the state if he then follows through on his pledge to quit politics.\n        Neither man is perfect. Mr. Suozzi has taken too much money from the attorney general's enemies on Wall Street, and Nassau County workers should not have been used to help in his campaign. Mr. Spitzer did not give Albany the same tough treatment as Wall Street.\n        But we believe that both of these good candidates have the right priorities when it comes to the governor's office. They both promise to fight to bring the budget under control, to effect campaign finance reform and to repair the scandalous way lawmakers' districts are drawn to keep them safely in office -- one of the fundamental changes needed in the state electoral system.\n        But Mr. Spitzer has the better chance of getting the job done.\n        The attorney general is running for governor with a national prestige and statewide popularity that could give him extraordinary power to impose change on the backward and recalcitrant State Legislature. Mario Cuomo and George Pataki both came into office with the intention of being a reformer in some important way, but neither man arrived with the independent political strength that Mr. Spitzer could bring to the job.\n        By forcing Mr. Spitzer to defend his record and to elaborate on crucial issues like taxes and health care, Mr. Suozzi succeeded in making the attorney general an even more compelling candidate. With regard for Mr. Suozzi, we nevertheless endorse Mr. Spitzer in the Democratic primary on Sept. 12.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1766684,"ids":1766684,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Emergency response planners in New York City -- or anywhere, for that matter -- face the difficult challenge of persuading people to prepare now for a disaster that may not happen soon, or even at all. But the need for readiness is clear. Beyond the possibility of terrorist attacks, there are other risks -- contagious diseases, chemical accidents or severe hurricanes -- that could endanger or severely disrupt daily life.\n        The state of preparedness among the city's emergency responders has never been better. But the same cannot be said about New Yorkers at large, many of whom could be caught off guard.\n        A study last month by the Center for Catastrophe Preparedness and Response at New York University and the American Red Cross in Greater New York showed that most New Yorkers would not have enough food or water in their homes to last three days. Even more astonishing, 53 percent said they would rely on cars or taxis to evacuate. This is an absurd idea, and could cause its own disaster, as we saw when gridlock plagued the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina.\n        The NYU-Red Cross survey, based on phone interviews with 1,000 New Yorkers, did show that more households are better prepared than they were a year ago. But more needs to be done. It isn't that the city hasn't tried; the Office Emergency Management has devised a campaign called Ready New York, which anticipates an impressive list of potential emergencies, with clear, helpful, multilingual directions on how to prepare and respond. It can be found online at www.nyc.gov\/html\/oem\/html\/readynewyork\/home.html. The office has also hired an ad agency to get out the word, which is good, because otherwise it could require an actual emergency to get busy New Yorkers to focus.\n        This being hurricane season, the possibility of a strong storm hitting the area -- the first one in two decades -- should prompt some general alertness. The Ready New York plan calls for a limited evacuation, prudently designating low-lying areas of the five boroughs. About 2.5 million people could be told to seek shelter on higher ground with friends or relatives, and as a last resort, go to designated shelters.\n        Hurricanes, charted in ever-more sophisticated ways, usually allow the luxury of hours, if not days, to move people out of harm's way. The city would have that time to use broadcasts and other means to inform the public.\n        Other emergency situations will require that people know what to do ahead of time. The attack on the World Trade Center and the blackout of August 2003 demonstrated how resilient, resourceful and generously helpful city residents can be. Still, the potential for a sustained event -- a hurricane, a contagion or worse -- could pose new tests, and that is when New Yorkers' comfort, safety and perhaps even survival will depend on knowing what to do. It's up to everyone to pay attention and prepare.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1753129,"ids":1753129,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Eminent domain, the ability of government to take private property for public use, is like any heavy-duty power tool: It can do a lot of damage if mishandled. But wielded cautiously and wisely, it can do much to advance the public interest.\n        A compelling example of the latter approach is the recent decision by the Town of Brookhaven to use its eminent-domain powers to take 40 acres of land away from a housing developer to preserve it for farming.\n        The action was a striking reversal of the old Long Island way of doing things. Typically it is sprawl and well-connected developers that win out over open space and farmers, and when the Democrats who control the town board prevailed in a 4-3 party-line vote, officials there rightly called it a historic moment. Their goal is to add the plot to the Manorville Farmland Protection Area, a 500-acre swath of undeveloped Brookhaven that has been protected from the relentless incursion of suburbia. The land will be leased to private farmers.\n        The decision prompted a howl from at least one property-rights advocate, a newspaper columnist who went so far as to revive the old ''Crookhaven'' label to condemn what he called an act of thievery by the town's new Democratic administration and its supervisor, Brian Foley.\n        But that recklessly applied smear is grossly unfair to Mr. Foley, who rightly points out that the eminent-domain decision was made only after careful consideration and after repeated efforts to reach an agreement on a sale price with the housing developer collapsed.\n        Mr. Foley also makes a compelling argument that in a region where McMansions are sprouting like toadstools, preserving open spaces and a rural character are an important priority of any responsible government.\n        Brookhaven's efforts, in fact, dovetail neatly with those of other towns and of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, which have dedicated millions of dollars to buying up and preserving undeveloped parcels. Long Island has sprawled almost to its limits, and while the need for housing remains dire, the best direction for new construction is not outward but inward -- in old downtowns and on distressed properties and reclaimed brownfields.\n        People are right to be on guard whenever government uses its power of eminent domain to transfer land from one private owner to another. The attachment to property rights runs deep, as the most recent Supreme Court decision on eminent domain vividly demonstrates. By upholding the right of the City of New London, Conn., to seize private homes for economic development, the court has provoked a nationwide scramble by state legislatures to refine and restrict their states' ability to exercise eminent-domain powers.\n        Yet the courts have long held that eminent domain need not always be restricted to public amenities like roads and bridges, and they have given governments wide discretion in deciding how to define a valid public use. If taking land for a private project provides a clear public benefit, if it is not done merely to make a private landowner richer or to discriminate against a specific class or group of people, and is a last resort when all other attempts at striking a fair deal fail, it can be justified.\n        The development needs of New London, a desperately down-and-out city, met those criteria, and it is clear that Mr. Foley's administration is also on the right, responsible track.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1771313,"ids":1771313,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Erratic record-keeping that varies from state to state makes it impossible for Americans to find out how schools in one place stack up against schools elsewhere. That is true for even the most basic comparisons. The No Child Left Behind Act, passed by Congress four years ago, was supposed to change all that by forcing states to file clear and accurate school-performance information with the federal government in exchange for education dollars. But despite a lot of rhetoric to the contrary, the national record-keeping effort is still a mess.\n        In some ways, things have gotten worse. States are manipulating school data to avoid unflattering comparisons and to elude the scrutiny of the Department of Education, which is charged by law with enforcing new federal requirements.\n        Right now, the government can't even tell how many American students are dropping out of high school -- which is a crucial indicator of how well the schools are doing their jobs. The generally accepted way to calculate graduation rates is to track students from the day they enter high school until the day they receive a regular diploma, counting nongraduates as those who leave the system without diplomas. Instead of mandating this approach, the Department of Education allowed states to calculate the rates any way they wanted, and to inflate the rates as much as they could.\n        Some states, for example, simply write off the students who drop out in grades 9, 10 or 11. That allows them to report the so-called graduation rate based on the number of graduates who began the year in the senior class. Some states have further padded their rates by including G.E.D. recipients -- who are actually dropouts and who are supposed to be counted as such.\n        This problem is underscored in a June 22 special report of Education Week magazine, which is devoted entirely to the graduation-rate issue. A particularly eye-opening analysis compared the graduation rates that the states actually reported to the federal government with the rates that emerged when students were carefully accounted for from ninth grade on. Not surprisingly, the state-reported graduation rates were nearly always higher, and in some cases more than 30 percentage points higher, than the estimates derived from the cumulative method.\n        The National Governors Association sent an encouraging message when it convinced all 50 states to work toward the generally accepted method of following students from ninth grade on. But this will be a tough sell, given that many states lack the data- gathering system to produce the information the country needs. And right now, there is little incentive to put together what will almost certainly be less flattering data. Congress should revisit this issue -- and mandate the correct method of calculating the rate -- when it reauthorizes the No Child Left Behind Act next year.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1794093,"ids":1794093,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Even if there were a case for staying the current course in Iraq, America's badly overstretched Army cannot sustain present force levels much longer without long-term damage. And that could undermine the credibility of American foreign policy for years to come.\n        The Army has been kept on short rations of troops and equipment for years by a Pentagon more intent on stockpiling futuristic weapons than fighting today's wars. Now it is pushing up against the limits of hard arithmetic. Senior generals are warning that the Bush administration may have to break its word and again use National Guard units to plug the gap, but no one in Washington is paying serious attention. That was clear last week when Congress recklessly decided to funnel extra money to the Air Force's irrelevant F-22 stealth fighter.\n        As early as the fall of 2003, the Congressional Budget Office warned that maintaining substantial force levels in Iraq for more than another six months would be difficult without resorting to damaging short-term expedients. The Pentagon then had about 150,000 troops in Iraq. Three years later, those numbers have not fallen appreciably. For much of that time, the Pentagon has plugged the gap by extending tours of duty, recycling soldiers back more quickly into combat, diverting National Guard units from homeland security and misusing the Marine Corps as a long-term occupation force.\n        These emergency measures have taken a heavy toll on combat readiness and training, on the quality of new recruits, and on the career decisions of some of the Army's most promising young officers. They cannot be continued indefinitely.\n        Now, with the security situation worsening in both Iraq and Afghanistan, the Pentagon concedes that no large withdrawals from either country are likely for the foreseeable future. As a result, even more drastic and expensive steps could soon be needed. The most straightforward would be to greatly increase the overall number of Army combat brigades. That would require recruiting, training and equipping the tens of thousands of additional soldiers needed to fill them.\n        Yet the Pentagon and Congress remain in an advanced state of denial. While the overall Defense Department budget keeps rising, pushed along by unneeded gadgetry, next year's spending plan fails to adequately address the Army's pressing personnel needs. Things have gotten so badly out of line that in August the Army chief of staff held up a required 2008 budget document, protesting that the Army simply could not keep doing its job without a sizable increase in spending.\n        A bigger army does not fit into Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's version of a technologically transformed military. And Congress prefers lavishing billions on Lockheed Martin to build stealth fighters, which are great for fighting Russian MIG's and Chinese F-8's but not for securing Baghdad. Army grunts are not as glamorous as fighter pilots and are a lot less profitable to equip. Yet we live in an age in which fighting on the ground to rescue failed states and isolate terrorists has become the Pentagon's most urgent and vital military mission.\n        America's credibility in that fight depends on the quality, quantity and readiness of our ground forces. If we go on demanding more and more from them while denying the resources they so desperately need, we could end up paying a terrible price.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1676640,"ids":1676640,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Even the government of Brazil seemed shocked by the news that despite efforts to curb deforestation -- including a $140 million package of conservation measures announced last year -- the destruction of the world's largest tropical forest, the Amazon, proceeds apace. In the 12-month period ending last August, farming and logging, much if it illegal, destroyed 10,000 square miles of forest, an area almost the size of Massachusetts. This was the biggest one-year loss since 1995, when the Amazon shrank by about 11,000 square miles.\n        Most of the Amazon lies in Brazil, but its destruction has been a matter of global concern ever since the 1980's, when satellite photographs documenting widespread burning of the forest first appeared. Like tropical forests everywhere, the Amazon is a storehouse of biodiversity, a source of medicines and an important antidote to global warming. Healthy forests absorb greenhouse gases. Blazing forests increase them.\n        The struggle to save the Amazon has claimed many victims, notably Chico Mendes, an environmentalist shot to death by two ranchers in 1988, and Dorothy Stang, an American-born nun and advocate for the forest and for peasant farmers who was gunned down earlier this year. Brazilian authorities have been intermittently responsive, setting aside forest preserves, ending subsidies to cattle ranchers and passing laws requiring landowners to leave much of their forest land untouched.\n        But the Amazon seems largely immune to law, especially in a country where there are not nearly enough police to enforce the rules, where economic growth seems to supersede everything and where powerful local politicians tend to have more influence than the national government.\n        Right now, for instance, the biggest single threat to the Amazon is the explosive growth of soybean farming in the state of Mato Grosso on the forest's southern fringe, fueled mainly by soaring demand in China and Europe. As it happens, Mato Grosso's governor, Blairo Maggi, is also its soybean king -- o rei da soja -- who has been quoted as saying that a 40 percent increase in deforestation in Mato Grosso ''doesn't mean anything at all, and I don't feel the slightest guilt over what we are doing here.''\n        There are people in the Brazilian government, in particular its environmental minister, Marina Silva, who believe there are better ways to assist Brazil's economy than by turning a valuable rain forest into cattle feed, which is essentially what Mr. Maggi is doing. But they need help -- from multilateral lending agencies and corporations, which should make sound environmental practices a condition of future investment, and from environmental organizations, which must keep up the public pressure.\n        Most of all they need help from Brazil's charismatic president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who must persuade himself and his country's agricultural oligarchy that the rain forest is not a commodity to be exploited for private gain.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1852524,"ids":1852524,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Ever since President Bush rammed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 through Congress to lend a pretense of legality to his detention camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, we have urged Congress to amend the law to restore basic human rights and judicial process. Rulings by military judges this week suggest that the special detention system is so fundamentally corrupt that the only solution is to tear it down and start again.\n        The target of the judges' rulings were Combatant Status Review Tribunals, panels that determine whether a prisoner is an ''unlawful enemy combatant'' who can be tried by one of the commissions created by the 2006 law. The tribunals are, in fact, kangaroo courts that give the inmates no chance to defend themselves, allow evidence that was obtained through torture and can be repeated until one produces the answer the Pentagon wants.\n        On Monday, two military judges dismissed separate war crimes charges against two Guant\u00e1namo inmates because of the status review system. They said the Pentagon managed to get them declared ''enemy combatants,'' but not ''unlawful enemy combatants,'' and moved to try them anyway under the 2006 law. That law says only unlawful combatants may be tried by military commissions. Lawful combatants (those who wear uniforms and carry weapons openly) fall under the Geneva Conventions.\n        If the administration loses an appeal, which it certainly should, it will no doubt try to tinker with the review tribunals so they produce the desired verdict. Congress cannot allow that. When you can't win a bet with loaded dice, something is wrong with the game.\n        There is only one path likely to lead to a result that would allow Americans to once again hold their heads high when it comes to justice and human rights. First, Congress needs to restore the right of the inmates of Guant\u00e1namo Bay to challenge their detentions. By the administration's own count, only a small minority of the inmates actually deserve a trial. The rest should be sent home or set free.\n        Second, Congress should repeal the Military Commissions Act and start anew on a just system for determining whether prisoners are unlawful combatants. Among other things, evidence obtained through coercion and torture should be banned.\n        And Congress should shut down Guant\u00e1namo Bay, as called for in bills sponsored by two California Democrats, Representative Jane Harman in the House and Senator Dianne Feinstein in the Senate. Both lawmakers are intimately familiar with the camp and have concluded it is beyond salvaging.\n        Their bill would close Gitmo in a year and the detainees would be screened by real courts. Those who are truly illegal combatants would be sent to military or civilian jails in the United States, to be tried under time-tested American rules of justice, or sent to an international tribunal. Some would be returned to their native lands for trial, if warranted. The rest would be set free, as they should have been long ago.\n        The Guant\u00e1namo camp was created on a myth -- that the American judicial system could not handle prisoners of ''the war against terror.'' It was built on a lie -- that the hundreds of detainees at Gitmo are all dangerous terrorists. And it was organized around a fiction -- that Mr. Bush had the power to create this rogue system in the first place.\n        It is time to get rid of it.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1803020,"ids":1803020,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Ever since anti-taxation zealots in California rediscovered the populist frisson of the ballot initiative a generation ago, American politics has gone off on a binge of ballot proposals.

Will Alaskans stop aerial hunting of wolves and bears? What happened in Oklahoma to impel the proposal to stop paying the salary of state legislators doing jail time? Arizonans will have to decide whether they want the state to randomly award $1 million to one lucky voter in future elections, in order to encourage turnout. (A better inducement, in a state where voters have to come up with opinions on 19 questions today, might just be to cut down on the initiatives.) Citizens in some states are being asked to stand up to the tobacco industry's national clout by approving higher tobacco taxes at home and greater restrictions on public smoking, while others are being asked to do the opposite.\n        The initiative movement was bad enough when special interest groups used it to encourage voters to believe they could get lower taxes and more services just by voting to make it so, encouraging a government-by-proposition lunacy that made it impossible for state governments to divide up their resources rationally. Lately, political parties have tried to insert hot-button social issues to lure their base to the polls. Thus the raft of anti-gay proposals that are a standard thrust of right-wing election strategists, with eight states asking voters to define marriage as strictly a heterosexual union. This year Democrats in six states have retaliated with proposals to increase the minimum wage.\n        The ballot questions getting the most national attention undoubtedly include the South Dakota proposal to overrule the Legislature's passage of a draconian ban on nearly all forms of abortion, and a Missouri constitutional amendment aimed at banning restrictions on stem cell research.

President Bush also has dodged the full force of public outrage because the victims were foreigners, mostly Muslims, captured in what he has painted as a war against Islamic terrorists bent on destroying America.\n        This week, The Times published two articles that reminded us again that the American military prisons are profoundly and systemically broken and that no one is safe from the summary judgment and harsh treatment institutionalized by the White House and the Pentagon after 9\/11.\n        On Monday, Michael Moss wrote about a U.S. contractor who was swept up in a military raid and dumped into a system where everyone is presumed guilty and denied any chance to prove otherwise.\n        Donald Vance, a 29-year-old Navy veteran from Chicago, was a whistle-blower who prompted the raid by tipping off the F.B.I. to suspicious activity at the company where he worked, including possible weapons trafficking. He was arrested and held for 97 days -- shackled and blindfolded, prevented from sleeping by blaring music and round-the-clock lights. In other words, he was subjected to the same mistreatment that thousands of non-Americans have been subjected to since the 2003 invasion.\n        Even after the military learned who Mr. Vance was, they continued to hold him in these abusive conditions for weeks more. He was not allowed to defend himself at the Potemkin hearing held to justify his detention. And that was special treatment. As an American citizen, he was at least allowed to attend his hearing. An Iraqi, or an Afghani, or any other foreigner, would have been barred from the room.\n        This is not the handiwork of a few out-of-control sadists at Abu Ghraib. This is a system that was created and operated outside American law and American standards of decency. Except for the few low-ranking soldiers periodically punished for abusing prisoners, it is a system without any accountability.\n        Yesterday, David Johnston reported that nearly 20 cases in which civilian contractors were accused of abusing detainees have been sent to the Justice Department. So far, the record is perfect: not a single indictment.\n        Administration officials said that prosecutors were hobbled by a lack of evidence and witnesses, or that the military's cases were simply shoddy. This sounds like another excuse from an administration that has papered over prisoner abuse and denied there is any connection between Mr. Bush's decision to flout the Geneva Conventions and the repeated cases of abuse and torture. We hope the new Congress will be more aggressive on this issue than the last one, which was more bent on preserving the Republican majority than preserving American values and rights. The lawless nature of Mr. Bush's war on terror has already cost the nation dearly in terms of global prestige, while increasing the risks facing every American serving in the military.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1749674,"ids":1749674,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Everybody in New York has a bitter divorce story, even if it's not personal. We all know the friend who can pay either the lawyer or the rent. Battles over children become so brutal that they and their parents are left traumatized. It can never be pleasant to end a marriage, but it does not have to be as awful and take as long as it does in New York State.\n        While most other states have some kind of one-step ''no fault'' divorce provision, New York still requires most couples to figure out who caused the marriage to fail. Under present law, a marriage cannot merely die. It must be killed by one spouse or the other, through adultery, cruel and inhuman treatment, or abandonment -- even when none of these things have actually occurred, and even when both people agree on all the particulars.\n        This means, in effect, that people have to lie; they have to go before a judge, swear to tell the truth and then not tell the truth. Those who deal with these issues day in and day out have concluded that pointing the finger at one spouse makes negotiations uglier, costlier and longer.\n        After two years of surveying New York's matrimonial law, a commission appointed by the state's chief judge, Judith Kaye, recommended last month overhauling divorce and child custody rules. The centerpiece of those recommendations is one-step, no-fault divorce that would make it easier for couples who want to end their marriages by mutual consent to do so.\n        In the past, with opposition from conservatives and the Catholic Church, some legislators in Albany have resisted changes in a divorce law often said to be one of the strictest in the nation.\n        Some women's groups have also resisted any changes, fearing that the ''vulnerable spouse,'' usually the woman, will fare poorly once no-fault comes into being.\n        Others have argued in favor of incremental change, like an adjustment a few years ago that allowed couples to get a divorce by mutual consent if they lived apart for a year and then filed for divorce -- an overly long and complicated process.\n        However, one important study for the National Bureau of Economic Research has shown that in states with no-fault divorce laws, where women can get out of a bad marriage more quickly, there were fewer suicides among women, less domestic violence and fewer women murdered by spouses. The Women's Bar Association, which earlier had opposed this shift, now endorses the no-fault option for New York couples.\n        The Legislature has yet to get very far on Judge Kaye's divorce proposal, but if this is going to bring relief to so many families, there is every reason for pro-family politicians to help move things along.\n        This proposal will not eliminate the full-court divorce -- the kind that provides endless fodder for the tabloids and makes celebrity lawyers so much richer. And any new law also should, of course, make it possible for spouses without financial means to have access to lawyers.\n        But right now, as Judge Kaye puts it, ''Divorce takes too long and costs too much -- too much money, too much agony.''

Those who fled the storm and its aftermath did not choose to move away. Many early evacuees thought they were leaving for a single day, never expecting that the levees would break and turn them into long-term exiles overnight.\n        It is the job of state and local officials to do everything reasonable to make sure that as few people as possible are disenfranchised. To raise awareness, the Louisiana secretary of state's office has organized a publicity blitz with newspaper advertisements and television and radio spots. There will be polling places for the New Orleans election in 10 other parishes around the state. Right now the state budget for this election is $3 million -- a figure that the secretary's office expects to climb to as much as $4 million -- compared with the $400,000 spent to hold a normal election.\n        Such efforts tell us that officials are taking the task seriously and making a good-faith effort to do the best job possible in the messy wake of a historic disaster. Yet with hundreds of thousands of city residents spread across the state, the region and the country, the election will invariably be imperfect.\n        Some civil rights advocates have gone to court to challenge the fairness of this month's election, especially for underprivileged African-Americans. They have called for satellite polling places in cities with large populations of displaced New Orleans residents, like Houston. The ruling that the city election should take place as scheduled, on April 22, was issued this week by Judge Ivan Lemelle of Federal District Court in New Orleans, himself an African-American and a former resident of the hard-hit New Orleans East neighborhood. A runoff is likely to be held later in the mayoral race. The judge declined to require voting centers out of state; the very legality of such polling stations is in doubt.\n        We do not believe that the election should be delayed indefinitely. The date has already been pushed back from Feb. 4 to permit the government to get organized and to give residents more time to return, as some did before Mardi Gras. It is impossible to wait for New Orleans to get back to normal. It will never be exactly the same as before the storm.\n        Judge Lemelle correctly called the voting ''a work in progress.'' Hard work is needed to ensure that as many voters as possible can exercise their rights. Many out-of-state residents can vote with absentee ballots. Those who have never voted before will have to make it back to Louisiana by Election Day. Groups that want to help could start by assisting evacuees with their absentee ballots and finish by chartering buses to transport first-time voters home for the election.\n        What would be unproductive would be trying to undermine the election. New Orleans's next leader needs a mandate to make tough decisions. That will happen only with an election that is as open and fair, and has as much participation, as possible.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1834145,"ids":1834145,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Exaggerated fears that illegal immigrants are fraudulently receiving Medicaid health benefits have led to a crackdown that is preventing tens of thousands of American citizens from obtaining legitimate coverage. Congress, whose mindless actions led to this travesty, needs to fix this injustice.\n        The problem was triggered by last year's Deficit Reduction Act, which contained provisions requiring applicants for Medicaid, a health insurance program for the poor, to show proof of their citizenship and identity when they apply for, or seek to renew, coverage. That may not seem unreasonable since eligibility is generally limited to American citizens and certain qualified aliens. But previously most states had simply asked applicants to declare in writing -- under penalty of perjury -- that they were citizens or qualified immigrants.\n        Now they must submit specified documents, such as birth certificates and passports, which many have difficulty tracking down or paying for. The Bush administration added to the difficulties by requiring people to submit original documents or copies certified by the issuing agency, not simply other copies they might have at hand.\n        The more stringent documentation was the brainchild of two Republican congressmen from Georgia. Never mind that there was little evidence that illegal immigrants were defrauding the program. Now the fruits of that policy are becoming visible. As Robert Pear recently wrote in The Times, at least seven states have reported declines in Medicaid enrollments and traced them to the new requirements. It is hard to be sure how many illegal immigrants were screened out, but state officials think the number is small. Florida believes that nearly all of the people it has excluded for failure to produce documents are American citizens.\n        The most appalling impact falls on infants born to illegal immigrants whose deliveries were paid for by Medicaid. They are American citizens under the 14th Amendment simply by virtue of being born here and used to be covered automatically for a year. Now they must wait until their skittish parents obtain a birth certificate before they can get vital infant care that should begin at birth.\n        Congress needs to move quickly to fix this problem. At a minimum, every poor infant born here ought to be automatically enrolled in Medicaid. Congress also needs to simplify the Medicaid application process instead of making it more onerous. That would be fairer to qualified applicants and could help reduce the ranks of the uninsured.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1805550,"ids":1805550,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Excuses sound hollow when you're trapped in a flimsy trailer. For Gulf Coast residents waiting for long-promised government housing assistance, patience has given way to anger, and anguish. What is clear more than a year after Hurricane Katrina is that their needs -- and the demand for action from the American public -- have largely gone unmet.\n        In Louisiana, only 28 families have received their share of the federal dollars intended to help them repair or replace their homes. After a local uproar, and a strict new deadline from the governor, the number of residents approved for funds is now just under 5,000 -- out of nearly 78,000 applications.\n        Louisiana's housing reconstruction authority should not bear all of the blame for this problem. All the gears of government grind too slowly for the victims of the storm. It took the Bush administration nearly six months to request the necessary rebuilding funds. Congress hemmed and hawed until June before approving the legislation. Down the coast, Mississippi's program has also been plagued with delays.\n        The federal housing money alone is not going to solve the difficulties faced by Katrina's victims, particularly in New Orleans. The normal market mechanisms on the Gulf Coast have been shattered, and they need to be repaired if Katrina's victims have any hope of putting their lives back together. Local banks are filling up with a reserve of billions of dollars in private insurance money. The Louisiana Recovery Authority points out that many victims who have been approved for help still have yet to ask for their checks.\n        Some people have shown amazing faith and determination, pressing on and putting construction costs on their credit cards. But other residents, in spite of their will to rebuild, are unable to use the funds for a host of reasons. Contractors are nearly impossible to find, and high prices reflect their scarcity. Insurance rates are rising to levels unaffordable for the average homeowner. Many victims have missed bill payments or lost sources of income, hurting their creditworthiness and leading to higher interest rates on any loans they might need.\n        The normal hard decisions of real estate are amplified a thousand times by the possibility that a house in an empty neighborhood in a broken city could be worthless. Imagine every house in your neighborhood is damaged or destroyed. The average government award in Louisiana is $60,200, and it will cost more than that to replace your house, and more than it was worth before the storm, when every house on the block was whole and children played out front. Do you rebuild?\n        The president's Katrina czar, Donald Powell, is soft-spoken and deliberative. Those qualities have served him well in the past, but not now. As the government's emissary (and the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), he has a powerful pulpit and the ability to summon all the key players -- major lenders, buyers of loans like the large investment banks and Fannie Mae, and federal regulators -- to help fix the system. Mr. Powell needs to speak out more forcefully and act more aggressively.\n        The ruin of a region and the historic city of New Orleans could not be more important, and the tangle of destruction is nowhere near unwound.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1698569,"ids":1698569,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Faced with high prison costs, the states have been desperately seeking ways to make sure that people who are released from prison will forge viable lives outside -- and not end up right back behind bars. Part of the solution is to help former inmates find training, jobs and places to live. In this context, the increasingly common practice of jacking up the costs of inmates' telephone calls to bankrupting levels, and then using the profits to pay for some prison activities, is self-defeating and inhumane. It also amounts to a hidden tax on prisoners' families, who tend to be among the poorest in American society.\n        A vast majority of the state prison systems have telephone setups that allow only collect calls. The person who accepts the call pays a premium that is sometimes as much as six times the going rate. Part of the money goes to the state itself in the form of a ''commission'' -- or, more simply put, a legal kickback.\n        While such commissions are common throughout the country, the one in New York is particularly high: the state takes a commission of nearly 60 percent. Faced with telephone bills of $400 or more a month, the inmates' families must often choose between paying phone bills or paying the rent. This billing strategy erodes fragile family ties by discouraging prisoners from keeping in touch with loved ones -- especially small children -- who often have difficulty visiting because they live hundreds of miles away. Inmates who lack family ties are less likely to make a successful transition once released, and more likely to end up back inside.\n        While most states use collect-calls-only phone systems for prisons, federal prisons use a less expensive and less onerous debit-calling system. Federal inmates are allowed to use money that is accumulated in computer-controlled accounts to call a limited number of phone numbers. Prison rights groups have long urged the states to adopt the debit-calling system. Lawsuits pending in several states, including in New York, could eventually force prison authorities to abandon their policies of allowing only collect calls. And the New York State Assembly has passed a bill that, if it becomes law, will put an end to this system.\n        New York state corrections officials argue that the current system is good thing because the money goes to pay for AIDS treatments, cable television for inmates and other prison programs that benefit the inmates. But the inmates' families already support the prison system through their taxes. Dunning the poor to run the prisons where so many of the poor wind up may have been acceptable in Dickens's time, but no longer.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1692296,"ids":1692296,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Facing crippling delays imposed by Congress, Cnooc, a state-controlled Chinese oil company, has now withdrawn its $18.5 billion bid for Unocal, conceding the prize to Chevron. That's a victory for Congressional China bashers, who continually blame China for economic woes that are largely of America's making. They successfully raised the specter of national security to justify their interference in the takeover contest.\n        But their victory is a loss for the United States' global interests, and it sets a dangerous precedent of dealing with China by demonizing the Chinese. That approach, in turn, risks turning China, an emerging superpower, into an aggressive opponent rather than simply a global competitor.\n        Losing Unocal, an oil company based in California, won't stop China from slaking its oil thirst somewhere else, any more than keeping the company under American ownership will quench ours. Unocal is small potatoes as oil companies go. But thwarting China may drive it even further in the direction of securing its energy from countries that really do pose a threat to America, like Iran, and from repressive regimes like the ones in Sudan and Myanmar. The United States would prefer that China cooperate with America's policy goals in such places, rather than striking oil deals that could strengthen the current rulers.\n        Denying China a shot at Unocal also invites retaliation. Analysts expect any blowback to be narrowly focused -- for instance, an airplane order might be directed to Airbus, the European consortium, rather than to Boeing. But, of course, Boeing would not be likely to think that a lost sale was a legitimate price to pay for keeping Cnooc away from Unocal, and angry politicians from the affected region would probably demand action against China.\n        So the way has been paved for tit-for-tat retaliation. That could be a precursor to escalation, which, in turn, could be the catalyst for a serious economic clash. Congress has already spent the summer considering half a dozen proposals for across-the-board tariffs against Chinese imports. The Bush administration is also trying to forcibly stem the flow of Chinese textiles into the United States.\n        Because China and the United States are co-dependent -- Americans buy the exports to keep the Chinese economy humming, and China buys Treasury debt to finance American deficits -- it's generally assumed that government and business leaders in each country will always, in the end, act rationally to avoid self-destruction. But an ongoing policy of brinksmanship is itself irrational.\n        The Congressional hysteria over the Cnooc bid demonstrates that only too well. It is a sad example of self-interested pandering for votes and contributions -- with little regard for the dangerous dynamic it could set in motion.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1823692,"ids":1823692,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Fact: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has a costly commuter-train armrest problem.

At the current rate of reimbursement for torn pants -- about $20,000 a year -- it would take the agency more than 287 years to burn through $5.75 million. Who knows if anyone will still be wearing pleated Dockers in 20 years, much less in the year 2294?\n        It is clear that $5.75 million is pocket change for an agency currently pursuing a five-year, $21 billion capital program that calls for entirely new train lines and stations, hundreds of new buses and subway cars, vital improvements to signal systems and countless other expenditures for maintenance and repair. But even modest amounts should be spent wisely.\n        This page previously endorsed the transportation authority's s plan to investigate and fix the evil-armrest problem.

And that is the ability -- the freedom, really -- to slump in your seat, close your eyes and never worry about tearing your pockets open again.\n        By that measure, $5.75 million buys a priceless amount of peace of mind.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1700341,"ids":1700341,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Fair warning to the suffering Gulf Coast masses: Congress is already talking of concocting ''economic stimulus'' and ''job creation'' packages as hurricane recovery tools. That sounds useful, but unfortunately those terms usually signal that the House and the Senate are about to use the crisis of the moment to roll out wasteful tax cuts for the well-off and pork barrel outlays for hometown voters.\n        The overwhelming need of the victims of Hurricane Katrina, coupled with the nation's shock at government ineptitude, should inspire members of Congress to sober up and become something approaching responsible policy makers. If they do decide to reform, there's an easy way to prove it. They could turn in their pork.\n        This summer, when Congress had to ignore only a war in Iraq, it passed the annual highway bill, repackaged as a job-creation measure. The legislation set a record of $24 billion in 6,371 ''earmark amendments'' -- the route individual lawmakers take to lock in prized projects for their home districts, regardless of proven need.\n        The bipartisan boondoggles that made it under the wire included vanity highways, tourist sidewalks, snowmobile trails, a ''deer avoidance'' plan and a graffiti elimination program for New York. Those wishing to look for still more unnecessary spending can consider the White House's $130-billion-and-counting missile defense system, which remains thoroughly inoperable.\n        Hurricane Katrina cries out to Congress for something other than business as usual. Imagine what would happen if each member of Congress announced that he or she would give up a prize slab of bacon so the government would be able to use the money to shelter hurricane victims and rebuild New Orleans. The public would -- for once -- have proof that politicians are capable of setting priorities and showing respect for the concept of a budget.\n        Surely Representative Don Young, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the transportation committee, might put off that $223 million ''bridge to nowhere'' in his state's outback. It's redundant now -- Louisiana suddenly has several bridges to nowhere. Likewise, Speaker Dennis Hastert could defer his prized Prairie Parkway, a $200-million-plus project dismissed as a behemoth Sprawlway by hometown critics, and use the money to repair the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.\n        The Democratic minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, could afford to donate back some multimillion-dollar plums -- just one bike and pedestrian overpass, perhaps, or a ferry terminal. Another Democratic standout, James Oberstar of Minnesota, would have a hard time choosing from his cornucopia, but that $2.7 million for what is already described as the nation's longest paved recreational trail looks ripe.\n        The list is long.

Newspapers have relied on countless government officials to divulge vital information that their bosses want to be kept secret. There is even value in the sanctioned leak, such as when the White House, say, lets out information that it wants known but does not want to announce.\n        But it is something else entirely when officials peddle disinformation for propaganda purposes or to harm a political adversary. And Karl Rove seems to have been playing that unsavory game with the C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame Wilson and her husband, Joseph Wilson IV, a career diplomat who ran afoul of President Bush's efforts to justify the invasion of Iraq. An e-mail note provided by Time magazine to the federal prosecutor investigating the case shows that Mr. Rove's aim in talking about Ms. Wilson to Matthew Cooper, a Time reporter, was to discredit Mr. Wilson, and perhaps to punish him.\n        Mr. Wilson had published an Op-Ed article in The Times about being assigned to investigate allegations that Saddam Hussein had tried to buy uranium from Niger -- a claim that was popular among the White House and Pentagon officials eager to make the case for war with Iraq. Mr. Wilson said the allegation was unsupported by evidence, and it was later withdrawn, to Mr. Bush's embarrassment.\n        Before that happened, Mr. Rove gave Mr. Cooper a ''big warning'' not to ''get too far out on Wilson.'' Mr. Rove said the origins of Mr. Wilson's mission were ''flawed and suspect'' because, according to Mr. Rove, Mr. Wilson had been sent to Niger at the suggestion of his wife, who works for the Central Intelligence Agency. To understand why Mr. Rove thought that was a black mark, remember that the White House considers dissenters enemies and that the C.I.A. had cast doubt on the administration's apocalyptic vision of Iraq's weapons programs.\n        Mr. Cooper's e-mail note does not say Mr. Rove mentioned the name of Mr. Wilson's wife; she was later identified by her maiden name in a column by Robert Novak. White House supporters are emphasizing that fact as they argue that Mr. Rove did not illegally unmask a covert officer. We don't need to judge that here. But there remains the issue of whether the White House used Mr. Wilson's wife for political reasons, and it's obvious that Mr. Rove did.\n        The White House has painted itself into a corner. More than a year ago, Mr. Bush vowed to fire the leaker. Then Scott McClellan, the president's spokesman, repeatedly assured everyone that the leaker was not Mr. Rove, on whom the president is so dependent intellectually that he calls Mr. Rove ''the architect.''\n        Until this week, the administration had deflected attention onto journalists by producing documents that officials had been compelled to sign to supposedly waive any promises of confidentiality. Our colleague Judith Miller, unjustly jailed for protecting the identity of confidential sources, was right to view these so-called waivers as meaningless.\n        Mr. Rove could clear all this up quickly. All he has to do is call a press conference and tell everyone what conversations he had and with whom. While we like government officials who are willing to whisper vital information, we like even more government officials who tell the truth in public.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1828383,"ids":1828383,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Fifteen years after the cold war's end, it would seem that everyone involved should know better. But the Bush administration's tone-deaf plan to station parts of a missile defense system in Eastern Europe and Moscow's snarling response show that all sides could use a refresher course in diplomatic sense and civility.\n        American officials insist that the 10 interceptors it is planning to place in Poland and the early warning radar for the Czech Republic are supposed to defend Europe from Iran's missiles -- not Russia's. And there is no doubt they're telling the truth. The untested system could be easily overwhelmed by Russia's huge nuclear arsenal.\n        It is unlikely, however, that more military posturing against Iran is going to persuade Tehran to give up its nuclear ambitions. Russia's furious reaction to the stationing of even weak missile defenses near its borders (and on the territory of its former satellites), while wildly out of proportion, was also utterly predictable. A top Russian general -- who sounded as if he'd slept through the last 15 years -- warned the Poles and the Czechs that if they went along with America's plans, Russia's missiles ''will be capable of targeting the facilities.''\n        The mixture of crocodile tears and threats from Russian officials seems overly dramatic -- and very much in character for President Vladimir Putin, who is hoping to divert attention from his own thuggery at home, not to mention his desire to reassert power in Russia's old neighborhood.\n        Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who cut her teeth on Kremlinology, should have expected Moscow's reaction. And Ms. Rice, who's been counting on Russia to help keep up the pressure against Iran's nuclear efforts, should have known that provoking Moscow this way could be especially counterproductive.

Then it approved a watered-down version of the grand promises of last January to rein in its quid pro quo romance with Washington's lobbyists. The measure now goes to a conference with the Senate, which has passed its own package of pulled punches. The resulting ''reform'' compromise can only become worse. Tailored for campaign sloganeering, it will do nothing about the influence-peddling core that was laid bare by the Jack Abramoff corruption scandal: lawmakers' unconscionable dependence on favored lobbyists eager to bundle campaign contributions from special-interest clients.\n        There's also no reason to believe that the average lawmaker has any real intention of following even the extremely modest ethics improvements that do make it through into law. Congress's ability to explain away almost anything was exemplified recently by the bumbling attempts of Representative Katherine Harris, the Florida Republican, to explain away her dinner with a since-convicted defense contractor on the make for earmarked helpings of taxpayers' money in return for his campaign donations. Disaffected staff members revealed that the dinner for two cost $2,800. This is a bit more than the $50 gift limit on feeding a lawmaker, and Ms. Harris had a number of creative explanations, including a theory that her dining partner might have taken the opportunity to order some expensive take-out wine. But the real bottom line was that with no one enforcing ethical rules in the House -- hey, bon app\u00e9tit.\n        And to gauge the sincerity of all the speeches on behalf of a new world order on Capitol Hill, consider the impassioned plea of Senator Rick Santorum during the ethics debate that lawmakers swear off their treasured perk of using private corporate jets for V.I.P. travel at token fees. It turns out that only two days earlier, before the plea by Mr. Santorum, the Pennsylvania Republican, fell on deaf ears, he used a BellSouth jet to hurry off to two fund-raising events for his re-election campaign. It came staffed with an attentive lobbyist.\n        For a perfect example of the ability to live in two different realities at the same time, one has to go no further than Michael Scanlon, former spokesman for Tom DeLay, the deposed majority leader whose House legacy includes neutering the ethics committee. As he awaits sentencing in the Abramoff scam that bilked $80 million from Indian casino tribes, Mr. Scanlon quietly picked up ''a loose end in my life'' and returned to college to defend his nearly forgotten graduate thesis. Reported in The Hill newspaper as a story of ''irony on steroids,'' Mr. Scanlon's scholarly thesis six years ago was an ''evaluative history of the House ethics process.''\n        Editorial\n        Correction:  May 13, 2006, Saturday  A May 6 editorial on Congressional ethics had an erroneous attribution. It should have credited Mary Ann Akers of the newspaper Roll Call with uncovering the fact that Michael Scanlon, a convicted former Congressional aide, was pursuing his graduate thesis on an ''evaluative history of the House ethics process.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1818847,"ids":1818847,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Fiscal discipline seems a quaint idea when money is pouring into the city treasury like beer at a Super Bowl party. But the Independent Budget Office knew what it was doing when it warned that lawmakers eager to spend the city's budget surplus could be looking at tax increases and spending cuts down the road unless they show restraint.\n        Fighting the urge to spend will be a real and pivotal test for the city's elected officials. This is a moment when New York needs to hold itself up as a model of fiscal prudence. And if it does, it can argue that it is worthy of being given more responsibility over its own financial house, something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.\n        The extra $700 million this year, on top of a $3.5 billion surplus last year, should put the city on good financial footing until 2009. After that, though, no one should assume that the real-estate boom and the Wall Street bulls will continue to buoy the economy. Mr. Bloomberg has rightly ended the myopia of budgets past, extending forward planning to four years, controlling spending where he could and lobbying the state where he could not.\n        Even so, there could still be red ink ahead. And should any city lawmaker be so dazzled by present-day surpluses as to overlook that danger, there are plenty of independent analysts with long memories ready to sound the alarm. The budget office has served this function for 10 years, analyzing budgets and spending on everything from housing to sports stadiums, and raising questions that officials would rather duck. And then there is the Financial Control Board, which came into being three decades ago, when the city verged on bankruptcy.\n        The board mostly serves as a monitor now, no longer an overlord, and the word ''Emergency'' was removed from its title, but it continues to do good work. Because of inept tinkering in Albany with the board's mandate, it could go out of business. But the mayor supports it and it deserves to survive.\n        Mr. Bloomberg and Christine Quinn, the Speaker of the City Council, should seize the opportunity to trumpet the city's fiscal soundness and use it to win more freedom from Albany. It's ridiculous that City Hall should have to ask state legislators' permission on almost anything of consequence -- on most matters involving taxation, for instance, and even for the right to investigate Medicaid fraud.\n        If the city shows self control, it should be rewarded with more control.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1796959,"ids":1796959,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor are facing the death penalty in Libya based on preposterous charges that they deliberately infected hundreds of children with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. This looming miscarriage of justice demands a strong warning to the Libyan leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi, that his efforts to join the ranks of peaceable nations will suffer if the medical workers are made the scapegoats for the failure of Libya's own health system.\n        The doctor and nurses, who had been working at a hospital in Benghazi, were arrested in 1999. They confessed under torture, according to human rights organizations, but later protested their innocence. The charges that they deliberately infected more than 400 children were clearly bogus.\n        One of the world's greatest experts on H.I.V., Dr. Luc Montagnier, testified that the real cause of the infections was poor hygienic practices at the hospital. The infections emerged before the accused started working at the hospital and continued to spread after they were thrown in jail.\n        It seems clear that the government wanted to deflect public outrage by accusing foreigners of committing a horrific crime -- rather than acknowledging the negligence of Libya's health system.\n        The six medical workers were convicted and sentenced to death in 2004, while nine Libyans who worked at the same hospital were acquitted. The convictions were overturned by the Libyan Supreme Court, which ordered a retrial. Defense attorneys fear the same outcome this time. The attorneys are calling for another independent scientific assessment of the case because the evidence offered by Dr. Montagnier and an Italian scientist was tossed out by the courts.\n        Thus far the United States and European nations have focused on setting up an international fund to care for victims of the tragedy and to upgrade equipment at the hospital -- in hopes that will be enough to get the medical workers set free. Libya is demanding substantial compensation as well, analogous to what it paid to families of the victims of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.\n        That seems a grotesque overreach given that the nurses and doctors are the victims here. The White House holds Libya up as a model for other nations to follow in renouncing weapons of mass destruction.

First, Gov. Charlie Crist says he plans to end the use of touch-screen voting machines that do not produce a paper record. Florida's move may finally sound the death knell for these unreliable, inherently antidemocratic voting machines.\n        After the 2000 election, there was a rush to eliminate the punch-card machines that produced the infamous hanging chads. But many states replaced them with paperless touch-screen machines that require voters to accept on faith that the reported vote totals accurately reflect the votes cast.\n        It has been hard to have faith. There have been widespread reports of ''vote flipping,'' in which machines record votes cast for one candidate as votes for the opponent. The Florida courts are still trying to resolve a challenge to a Congressional race last fall in which as many as 18,000 votes may have disappeared. The race was extremely close, and the possibly missing votes were in the losing candidate's strongest county.\n        Governor Crist is asking the Legislature to finance the purchase of new optical-scan machines, and it is expected to agree. Choosing optical scans is Governor Crist's second good move. In optical-scan voting, voters mark a paper ballot that is then read by a computer. Polling place lines are shorter, because many voters can fill out ballots at the same time. These paper ballots are the official ballots, and can be recounted by hand to resolve a dispute.\n        More than half the states -- including large ones like California, New York, Illinois and Ohio -- require computerized voting machines to produce a paper record. The addition of Florida would be a major defeat for election officials and voting-machine companies that have stubbornly opposed paper-trail requirements.\n        Governor Crist's move should provide further momentum for a bill that Representative Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, plans to introduce in Congress today that would require voting machines nationwide to produce voter-verified paper records.\n        With the Democrats in control of Congress, the bill has a good chance of passing. But it is gratifying that Florida's shift is led by a Republican governor, and expected to pass a Republican-controlled Legislature. This has for too long been considered a Democratic issue. It shouldn't be. It is, as Governor Crist said, ''common sense.''","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1849189,"ids":1849189,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"For a U.N.-baiting, diplomacy-bashing crowd, the Bush administration has shown unexpected patience in trying to persuade the Security Council to punish Iran for its nuclear misbehavior. And for a foot-dragging, conflict-averse crowd, the Security Council has moved with alacrity in imposing two sets of sanctions on Iran just since December.\n        Unfortunately, Iran is still playing to type.\n        Nine months after the Council ordered Tehran to suspend enriching uranium, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency say Iran's scientists are close to mastering the process that would allow them to produce fuel for a nuclear weapon.\n        Some diplomats have begun arguing that now that the ''point of no return'' has passed, the Security Council should drop its insistence that Iran halt all enrichment -- and the sanctions attached to that demand -- and focus on trying to contain the size of the enrichment program and ensuring that inspectors can monitor the effort. That may well be where this will all end up. But it is far too soon to make that sort of concession, especially since Iran has a proven record of pocketing concessions and pushing its program ahead.\n        Given the urgency and ambition of Iran's nuclear program, what is needed is a more urgent and ambitious international response. Let us be clear, this is not a call for more White House saber rattling and certainly not for military planning. There is no military solution. But unless Iran's leaders are offered far more attractive rewards -- yes, we're talking about a grand bargain -- and threatened with far more painful punishments -- yes, that could mean another spike in world oil prices -- there is no chance of changing their behavior.\n        That means that President Bush is going to have to put a lot more on the table, including a clear offer of full diplomatic relations and security guarantees should Iran agree to verifiably contain its nuclear ambitions. And it also means that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese are going to have to take a lot more off the table, cutting back diplomatic and trade relations if Tehran continues to push its nuclear program ahead.\n        It is hard to decide which is making Tehran more cocky these days: its scientists' technical successes or America's disastrous failure in Iraq. But its recent talk of rationing gasoline -- now delayed -- shows a clear and present vulnerability.\n        Until now, both Mr. Bush and his diplomatic partners have managed to sidestep any really tough choices when it comes to Iran's nuclear program. The lesson of the new I.A.E.A. report is that the time for sidestepping has run out. What is needed is a frank and public discussion about the cost of Iran getting a nuclear weapon and what the world is willing to give and take away to try to prevent that.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1649929,"ids":1649929,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"For anyone who has ever spent an evening absorbed in ''Death of a Salesman,'' watching Willy Loman's ineffably sad decline, there should be little doubt about Arthur Miller's genius. Still, when the mourning ends for Mr. Miller, who died Thursday, the question of the timelessness of his work will remain. Mr. Miller's career had its share of misfires, but on the strength of his best plays, he seems as destined for immortality as his most famous character was for obscurity.\n        Mr. Miller's plays are entrenched in the American canon, and in high school curriculums, but there have always been skeptics. Part of the problem is that Mr. Miller's private life, notably his marriage to Marilyn Monroe, often overshadowed his literary work. The story of the romance between the egghead playwright and the Hollywood bombshell was so captivating that the stories Mr. Miller was writing for the stage could not always compete.\n        I heard Mr. Miller give a public address, when he was well into his 80's, at which members of the audience were told before the question-and-answer period that they could ask about anything but Monroe. ''How do you remember Marilyn Monroe?'' a woman asked from the balcony. The audience let out a collective groan. Mr. Miller paused for a moment, smiled ruefully, and said simply, ''It's easy.''\n        More significant, perhaps, are the reservations critics have about political art. A child of the Depression, Mr. Miller wrote drama that took social class seriously, and that unabashedly did battle with villains like corporate malfeasance -- the subject of ''All My Sons,'' in which a military manufacturer knowingly sells defective parts, causing the deaths of American pilots.\n        To critics who equate politically minded theater with agitprop, Mr. Miller's moral passion always made him suspect. But his best works arise out of their time, and transcend it. ''The Crucible'' may have been an allegory of McCarthyism, but new generations have eagerly adopted it, sometimes blithely unaware of its provenance, because of what it says about the human heart.\n        Mr. Miller himself appreciated the way in which different generations related to his work. I had the good fortune to be invited to a small dinner with Mr. Miller in 2002, when he was awarded The Chicago Tribune's literary prize. Someone asked him if any of his plays were especially popular just then. Mr. Miller had a grin on his face when he said he was flooded with requests to revive ''All My Sons.'' The news had been full of Enron and WorldCom, and, Mr. Miller said, people could smell the corporate mendacity in the air.\n        ADAM COHEN","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1691686,"ids":1691686,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"For five years, President Bush has said that he really wants to reform immigration, but when the Senate finally took up the issue last week, the White House went missing. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao backed out of the hearing at the last minute, a gap that was noted with understandable irritation by Senator Arlen Specter, chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n        With an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, immigration is too big for the White House to ignore. If there is debate within the Bush administration about where immigration reform should go, there are several proposals that deserve consideration.\n        The best comprehensive bill so far comes from Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Edward Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, among others. The bill finds ways for the nation to deal with border security, a large underground society and the need for more unskilled labor in this country. It would set up a guest worker program and begin the process of making the illegal immigrants legal, by making participants pay back taxes and fines, then go to the end of the line to get a green card.\n        Two Republican senators, Jon Kyl of Arizona and John Cornyn of Texas, propose drastically beefing up border patrol. This would be a good thing if the proposal also offered a more realistic solution to the illegal population. It does not. Those in the country illegally would have to return home to apply for a green card -- an invitation, it would seem, for most of them to stay hidden.\n        As Washington circles this tough issue, problems with immigration only grow. Almost 500,000 immigrants a year pour over the border to take backbreaking unskilled jobs that Americans don't want. The United States offers about one legal visa for every 100 workers who sneak into the country. But without that work force -- over 4 percent of the country's workers by some estimates -- the economy would sour. So we are left with an inhumane system, with jobs available to whoever can break into the country to get them.\n        Tamar Jacoby of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research summed up the goal at the Senate hearing last week: ''to remain a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws.'' Mr. Specter has finally started the hard work required to reach that goal.

This week, it was the turn of Bradley Schlozman, a former federal attorney in Missouri, to be uninformative and not credible. It is time for Senator Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to deliver subpoenas that have been approved for Karl Rove, former White House counsel Harriet Miers and their top aides, and to make them testify in public and under oath.\n        Mr. Schlozman was appointed United States attorney in Missouri while the state was in the midst of a hard-fought Senate race. In his brief stint, he pushed a lawsuit, which was thrown out by a federal judge, that could have led to thousands of Democratic-leaning voters being wrongly purged from the rolls. Just days before the election, he indicted voter registration workers from the liberal group Acorn on fraud charges. Republicans quickly made the indictments an issue in the Senate race.\n        Mr. Schlozman said it did not occur to him that the indictments could affect the campaign. That is hard to believe since the Justice Department's guidelines tell prosecutors not to bring vote fraud investigations right before an election, so as not to affect the outcome. He also claimed, laughably, that he did not know that Acorn was a liberal-leaning group.\n        Mr. Schlozman fits neatly into the larger picture. Prosecutors who refused to use their offices to help Republicans win elections, like John McKay in Washington State, and David Iglesias in New Mexico, were fired. Prosecutors who used their offices to help Republicans did well.\n        Congress has now heard from everyone in the Justice Department who appears to have played a significant role in the firings of the prosecutors. They have all insisted that the actual decisions about whom to fire came from somewhere else. It is increasingly clear that the somewhere else was the White House. If Congress is going to get to the bottom of the scandal, it has to get the testimony of Mr. Rove, his aides Scott Jennings and Sara Taylor, Ms. Miers and her deputy, William Kelley.\n        The White House has offered to make them available only if they do not take an oath and there is no transcript. Those conditions are a formula for condoning perjury, and they are unacceptable. As for documents, the White House has released piles of useless e-mail messages. But it has reported that key e-mails to and from Mr. Rove were inexplicably destroyed. At the same time, it has argued that e-mails of Mr. Rove's that were kept on a Republican Party computer system, which may contain critical information, should not be released.\n        This noncooperation has gone on long enough. Mr. Leahy should deliver the subpoenas for the five White House officials and make clear that if the administration resists, Congress will use all available means to get the information it needs.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1817040,"ids":1817040,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"For nearly five years, the Diocese of Bridgeport has been fighting to keep secret thousands of documents that detail how it handled 23 sex-abuse cases settled in 2001.

But the diocese's sanctimonious statement in reply to Judge Alander's decision is so outrageous it should not go unanswered.\n        In that brief response, the diocese justified its campaign to keep the records closed on the basis of promoting the privacy and well-being of the victims. It also said, ''reopening and exposing long-settled cases, extensively covered by the media, to renewed public scrutiny is not a productive way to achieve the healing and resolution that the community seeks.''\n        Yet the lawyer for the victims has told the court, as early as 2002, that none of them -- not one -- objected to release of the more than 900 documents involved. That the diocese would dare to use the welfare of the victims to justify keeping secret the crimes of the clergy against them is downright Orwellian.\n        Church officials have also taken pains to point out that releasing the records could threaten the right to a fair trial of defendants in two of the cases in which there is pending litigation. But, as Judge Alander wrote, reasonable alternatives exist to adequately protect such rights short of keeping secret all 23 cases and more than 12,000 pages of information.\n        The Diocese of Bridgeport covers all of Fairfield County, where 51 percent of the population -- more than 450,000 people -- is Catholic. The diocese is spending enormous amounts of time and money to keep from its own the shameful details of how it sheltered child molesters. If there is any justice, the State Supreme Court should quickly dispense with this latest appeal. The diocese should not be allowed to lock out the public indefinitely. And common decency should have prevented the diocese from attempting to justify its actions in the name of caring for victims whom its clergy molested.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1686689,"ids":1686689,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"For nearly four years now, the 9\/11 families -- those who lost immediate family members in that tragedy -- have provided an inestimable service to this nation. They helped drive forward the inquiries of the Sept. 11 commission. They helped formulate any number of the projects being developed at ground zero. They have reminded us conscientiously of what was lost on that day.\n        But in the past few weeks, we've watched a handful of vocal family members, who may not represent a majority of 9\/11 families, change the dynamic at the World Trade Center site for the worse. They have begun a movement to ''take back the memorial,'' which means, in essence, eventually purging ground zero of its cultural partners, including the International Freedom Center.\n        This protest resulted in a shocking response in late June from Gov. George Pataki. He openly joined the criticism of one of those institutions -- the Drawing Center -- for an exhibition that it sponsored, in another part of town, that contains controversial images of 9\/11 and America's role in the world. And he has called on all the cultural partners at ground zero for reassurances that their programs will harmonize with the concerns of this small group of family members.\n        The World Trade Center site is of enormous importance to all New Yorkers, to all Americans and to people around the planet who have united to fight the insidious forces that led to 9\/11. Mr. Pataki's job is to represent all those deeply interested parties. By attempting to appease one small, vocal group of protesters who are unlikely to be appeased anyway, he is abrogating the rights of everyone else. And he runs the risk of turning ground zero into a place where we bury the freedoms that define this nation.\n        There must be no mistake about this. If the Drawing Center is forced to withdraw from ground zero rather than accept the censorship of exhibitions that are yet to be imagined, no other respectable arts institution will take its place.\n        What was offered as an open invitation to restore the artistic life of Lower Manhattan will have turned into an invitation to provide only the kind of cultural offerings that please a vocal group of people whose genuine grief has already taken on a sharply political edge. Those are unacceptable conditions that would undermine the very purpose of the arts. If the International Freedom Center must continually bend over backward to placate a handful of angry family members, then all of its commitment to the conscience of that site, to what it can teach us about the character of freedom in the world, will have been compromised.\n        What we build at ground zero has to honor the memory of one terrible day in the history of America, but it also has to belong to the future as well, a future as optimistic and forward-looking as we can imagine. It cannot be a place devoted entirely to death. If ground zero is not a place of life and creativity, of true artistic and political freedom, then it will not be successful even as a place of grief.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1821298,"ids":1821298,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"For six years, off and on, President Bush has been talking about the need for alternative fuels and conservation to make the country less beholden to unreliable sources of foreign oil. Yet all he has to show for it is a growing dependence on foreign oil, a growing climate problem and an increasingly cynical public. Mr. Bush talked the same game on Tuesday night, offering several impressively specific goals. But whether these new pledges turn out to be as empty as the old ones depends on his capacity for follow-through, and history is not encouraging.\n        Mr. Bush was true to form on one subject. The White House had promised nothing on global warming, and he delivered nothing. He mentioned ''global climate change'' but showed no sense of urgency on the issue. Nor was there any sign that he had even heard the ever-louder entreaties from Congress -- and from many of his friends in the business community -- that he support a national program of mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases.\n        At one point, he did suggest that his proposals for alternative fuels and more efficient automobiles could also help reduce greenhouse gases. But these gains would be marginal -- passenger vehicles account for only one-fifth of these gases. And even these gains will greatly depend on what alternative fuels are chosen.\n        Mr. Bush's enthusiasms mainly involved energy independence. He called for replacing 35 billion gallons of gasoline with renewable or alternative fuels by 2017, and for modest but steady improvements in the efficiency of cars and light trucks, a category that includes S.U.V.'s.\n        But he offered no specifics on where these 35 billion gallons in alternative fuels are going to come from. Corn ethanol, a favorite of farm state politicians, cannot be expected to provide more than 15 billion gallons without driving up food prices. Cellulosic ethanol, made from grasses and woody material, shows great promise. But there is no commercial refinery in operation today, and there is not expected to be one for several years. Hydrogen, a longtime Bush favorite, is even further down the road.\n        That leaves gasoline derived from coal, a method now being championed by governors and senators from coal-producing states. The technology is well established. But refining and then burning a gallon of gasoline derived from coal would send nearly twice as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a conventional gallon of gasoline and would thus be a disaster for global warming. Trying to sequester the carbon dioxide underground during the refining process would be hugely expensive.\n        Which raises the next question about the Bush plan: Where's the money coming from? Despite growing interest among venture capitalists in environmentally friendly technologies, it seems unrealistic to depend on the private sector alone. Washington must help. But federal research and development spending on energy has been in free fall for more than 20 years. And even after Mr. Bush made a big deal about cellulosic ethanol in last year's address, he came up with only about $30 million in new money to help move the technology forward.\n        Once again, we have heard this president make big promises about energy independence. Once again, we fear that very little will change. It would be nice, for once, to be surprised.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":5,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1762962,"ids":1762962,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"For some time now, shortsighted lawmakers in Congress have been threatening China with tariffs for what they call its unfair currency practices. The Bush administration, to its credit, has generally resisted the protectionist rant, most notably by refusing to brand China a ''currency manipulator'' in an official report to Congress last week.\n        China responded to the administration's responsible policy and diplomatic courtesy this week when it loosened, a bit, the tether that binds the Chinese currency, the yuan, to the dollar. A stronger yuan implies a weaker dollar, as does the general strengthening so far this year of the euro and the yen. By making foreign goods sold here more expensive and American goods sold abroad cheaper, a weaker dollar would, in theory, eventually help reduce the United States' huge trade gap.\n        The problem is this: unless a falling dollar is paired with reductions in the federal budget deficit, it could do more harm than good by driving up interest rates, perhaps sharply. That's because the foreign investors who finance the administration's ''borrow as you go'' budget are likely to demand higher returns to invest in a depreciating dollar.\n        But if budget deficits declined over the long run, the government's reduced need to borrow would help keep interest rates low as the dollar depreciated. Then, after a lag, the falling dollar would shrink the trade deficit without risking big increases in interest rates in the process.\n        Unfortunately, the incessant tax cutting of the past five years precludes any serious attempt to reduce the budget deficit. So to keep interest rates in check as the dollar falls, the administration would have to persuade investors not to believe what they see: a dollar that is declining even as the United States does nothing to curb its borrowing.\n        That would be a difficult trick even for a Treasury Department that commanded respect. It will be especially difficult for Mr. Bush's Treasury team, which has suffered a diminution of esteem and credibility.\n        The Bush tax cuts also make it harder for Americans as a nation to bail themselves out of the trade deficit by saving more. Higher personal savings would allow the government to finance its budget deficit without outsized foreign borrowing -- another safe route to a cheaper dollar and a smaller trade gap. But the Republicans who control Congress let a tax credit for low-income savers expire this year to free up room in the budget for nearly $70 billion in additional tax cuts for high-income Americans over the near term.\n        That tax cut bill, signed into law this week by President Bush, also commits an estimated $53 billion through the middle of the century to help those same high earners shift their existing savings into tax shelters. This adds not one cent of new savings and presages big deficits far into the future.\n        A weakening dollar, on top of intractable budget deficits and a chronic savings shortfall, is a recipe for recession. The question now is whether the country will change direction in time. The portents are not good.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1644750,"ids":1644750,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"For the city and its Fire Department, both still rebuilding from the attacks of Sept. 11, the deaths this week of three firefighters in two separate blazes seem especially hard to accept. In Brooklyn, one courageous New Yorker died after apparently becoming trapped in a basement while he searched for victims. In the Bronx, a far more puzzling set of circumstances sent six firemen plunging from windows of a tenement's fire-engulfed fourth floor. Two of the men died, but miraculously four survived the fall, although with serious injuries.\n        In both cases, the firefighters seem to have believed there were lives to be saved and were following the city's longstanding policy of using aggressive procedures to search for and rescue fire victims. Entering burning buildings is part of the job, of course, but it's complicated in New York. People tend to live vertically, in buildings taller than three stories. And city firefighters routinely search the floors above the fire, a practice that firefighters credit for about half of their rescues. It's hard to argue with that kind of success, but the fatalities in the Bronx fire point to a need to re-examine the protocol for the risks it poses to firefighters, and to make sure they are being kept as low as humanly possible.\n        Little seems to have gone right, for example, for the men battling the tenement blaze. The Fire Department says there was a report of trapped people, which proved erroneous. Wall partitions in the apartment, which investigators are looking into, may have cut off access to exits. And one of two fire hoses that should have controlled the blaze in the floor below the victims lost pressure, possibly because of freezing or debris in the line, or even something as simple as a kink in the hose. That allowed the flames to shoot through the floor beneath them, and left the six men no choice but to be burned or jump.\n        The deaths occurred as the city was digging out of more than a foot of snow, and during the season when the risk of fires is highest, often because of dangerous space heaters or other means people in older buildings employ to keep warm. New Yorkers have come to view fire fatalities as uncommon -- fewer than 100 fire deaths occurred last year, the lowest number in eight decades. That is because of better construction; more safety tools, like sprinkler systems and in-home alarms; and better firefighting. While the Fire Department investigates and firefighters prepare heroes' farewells for their comrades, it's right to think about how the sacrifice of these heroes can help make everyone else safer.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1665033,"ids":1665033,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"For the fourth time in four years, the House of Representatives has passed a bill calling for the permanent repeal of the federal estate tax. The Senate should put a stop to this silliness. The only thing driving the push for repealing the estate tax is ideology. It sure isn't sound tax policy.\n        The House proposal would cost the federal government a whopping $290 billion through 2015, according to estimates by Congress's own budget agency. And that's just a start; the costs after that would be explosive. And for what? Repeal would shield the estates of the very wealthiest Americans from the tax. That's the same group that already benefits the most from Mr. Bush's tax breaks for dividends and capital gains.\n        Repeal of the estate tax was deemed too expensive in 2001, when the government was still enjoying the Clinton-era budget surplus. So it stands to reason that it's out of the question today, as America's enormous deficits weaken the domestic economy and the country's international economic leadership. But to its proponents, estate-tax repeal is the holy grail of the Republican anti-tax crusade.\n        The most commonly heard argument against the estate tax -- that it represents unfair double taxation -- is specious. First, the estate tax does not even kick in until the assets left at death exceed $1.5 million, or $3 million per married couple -- and those exemption amounts will more than double by 2009. So most Americans never even have to think about the estate tax, let alone worry about it coming on top of some other tax.\n        Second, much of the wealth transferred at death has never been taxed. That's because capital gains on assets like houses, stocks and bonds are not taxed until the asset is sold. Obviously, if you inherit, say, a house, its owner didn't sell it, so never paid any capital gains tax on it.\n        Another popular argument against the estate tax -- that the rate is so high the government is basically confiscating your property -- is also a sham. Estate tax rates currently top out at 47 percent. But those rates don't even start to apply until an estate tops the multimillion-dollar exemption. As a result of the exemption and other deductions, the effective tax rate -- the percentage that is actually handed over to the government -- is much lower than the top stated rate. It was only 18.8 percent, on average, in 2003, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n        The estate-tax foes' real beef is not with the estate tax per se. It's with the principle that the more you earn, the more taxes you should pay and, specifically, with the idea of taxing capital gains. Those debates are as old as the tax system itself. The Senate must stand firm for an estate tax that provides an ample exemption of up to $2 million per person, but with a top rate, 45 percent, that ensures that a reasonable amount is actually paid to the government. Anything less would impair fairness and could be fiscally crippling for decades to come.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1711254,"ids":1711254,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"For the last five years, Guatemala has suffered an epidemic of gruesome killings of women that are as mysterious as they are brutal. Typically a young woman in Guatemala City vanishes, and her body turns up a few days later in a garbage bag or in an open field. Many of the women's faces and bodies have been mutilated, and many have been tortured sexually or otherwise. Some of the bodies have messages, like ''death to bitches,'' scrawled on them.\n        In Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, a pattern of hundreds of killings of this type has drawn international condemnation. But aside from reports by Amnesty International and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Guatemalan women's deaths have gotten very little attention. At least a thousand women have been victims in the past five years, and only three killers are in prison. The police do not even investigate a vast majority of cases.\n        Guatemala does not keep reliable statistics. But it is clear that a pattern of these killings was first seen in 2000, and the reported numbers have risen since then. Last year, there were 590 such killings of women, and the murders have grown more grisly. Many of the women were victims of gang warfare. Others were killed by husbands or boyfriends. But there are also cases of college students or shop workers who had no links to crime and simply disappeared -- until their bodies were found.\n        What the women have in common is that their cases go nowhere. Overwhelmingly, victims' families report that the response of the authorities is a lack of interest. The police assure them that a missing daughter, for example, has run off with a boyfriend. When the body turns up, the crime is often dismissed with comments that the dead woman must have been a gang member or a prostitute, or killed by her partner -- as if these were justifications for failing to investigate.\n        Guatemala has recently signed several international conventions protecting women, and it has established such new organizations as the office of the special prosecutor for crimes against women. But this progress is largely on paper. Laws are not enforced, and there is no money to finance the new offices. Guatemala is still a country where a rapist can escape charges by marrying the victim, and domestic violence cases can be prosecuted only if the victim can still show bruises 10 days later. Sexual harassment is not illegal.\n        When such outdated attitudes toward women prevail, it is easy for the local authorities to justify taking no action when young women are murdered. Their inaction gives an official green light to the killers of women.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1764993,"ids":1764993,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"For the wheelchair-bound in New York, transportation is a huge challenge. The city's buses accommodate wheelchairs, but buses don't go everywhere. Subways, meanwhile, are next to impossible to navigate; just 54 of 468 stations have elevators. Often, the only solution is a taxicab, but there are very few yellow cabs that cater to the disabled.\n        Mayor Michael Bloomberg stepped in last week to address the inadequacy. Overruling his own commissioner, he decided that of 308 taxi medallions to be auctioned next month, 54 must be set aside for disabled-accessible vehicles. The remainder would be assigned to hybrid or alternative fuel cars.\n        The mayor did the right thing on both fronts. Of some 12,779 taxis, only 29 have been equipped to carry wheelchairs. That number would nearly triple in coming months, and another 150 would be added, if the state approves the city's request to increase medallions. Still, the chances of a person with disabilities being able to hail an accessible cab are small. Michael Harris, of the Disabled Riders Coalition, said he had such luck just once, only to get a driver who illegally denied him a ride.\n        There needs to be a better way. For starters, the city should immediately design a system, perhaps like the one proposed in the City Council, which would use the city's 311 telephone system to dispatch accessible cabs to people needing them.\n        Just one type of vehicle, the Chevrolet Uplander minivan, meets the narrow qualifications for accessible cabs set by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. The market could and would produce more acceptable vehicles if the city were more flexible with its specifications, allowing a back entry ramp, for example, instead of just a side entry, and if there were a clear demand for such vehicles.\n        The additional cost of specialty cabs would be offset by cheaper medallions, lower fuel costs for hybrids, and the fact that accessible cabs would be allowed to stay in service longer than ordinary cabs. And more ambitious goals -- equipping, say, one-fourth of the fleet for wheelchairs -- would encourage makers to develop cheaper vehicles. Market forces responded quickly when New York joined other cities in approving hybrids. Owners now have no fewer than eight models to choose from.\n        The city requires that regular, gasoline-burning cabs be retired after three years. The turnover affords an excellent opportunity to begin reshaping the fleet.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1820362,"ids":1820362,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"For years now, it has been common knowledge that many of the harsh drug laws enacted in the 70s and 80s not only do not work, but have an unfair impact on minorities. That is especially true of a 1987 New Jersey law setting up 1,000-foot zones around schools where anyone convicted of a drug crime would automatically be sentenced to extra time in prison.\n        The purpose was obvious: to keep drug dealers away from youngsters. But a commission of New Jersey law enforcement officials, legislators and a retired judge found more than a year ago that the law was not protecting children but instead giving blacks and other minority drug offenders far tougher punishment than whites convicted of the same crimes. That is just not right.\n        A study of 90 drug-free zone cases, cited by the commission, showed that not one defendant had sold drugs to a minor. The commission also said that 96 percent of those serving time for drug crimes in drug-free zones were either black or Hispanic. The reason was that in the cities, where more minority members live, almost every street corner or sidewalk is within 1,000 feet of a school, while in mostly white suburban and rural areas it is easy to get outside the thousand-foot zone. With virtually entire cities inside the drug-free zones, the commission said, urban drug offenders have no incentive for staying away from schools.\n        Legislators quickly promised corrective action. An Assembly committee approved a measure narrowing the zones and a state senator said action would be taken in 2006. Nothing has happened on this issue since then.\n        Shaken by this yearlong lack of action and fearful that penalties in the 1,000-foot zones will be increased, the New Jersey commission is about to renew its demand that legislators and Gov. Jon Corzine take action. What the panel wants is a law that would shrink all drug-free zones to 200 feet, toughen penalties for those convicted of drug crimes within that smaller zone and give judges discretion to lessen penalties when circumstances dictate. The new law would increase penalties to 5 to 10 years rather than the existing three to five.\n        When a commission composed in part of officials who have dealt with the drug problem on a daily basis concludes that a drug punishment law is neither fair nor serving its purpose, it is time for the Legislature and governor to change it. Until they do, minorities will continue paying an unfair price and children will not get the protection they deserve.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1664803,"ids":1664803,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"For years now, we've been hearing about the importance of hydration to avoid heat stroke during prolonged exercise in hot weather. Now, it turns out, too much hydration can kill you.\n        A study published today in The New England Journal of Medicine should give weekend warriors reason to rethink the wisdom of quaffing vast amounts of water or sports drinks while exercising vigorously -- at least if they are engaging in such endurance tests as a marathon. The study found that a marathon runner could dangerously dilute the blood with an overdose of liquids, risking a coma and even death. The problem has also been detected during long military maneuvers, extended bike rides and blistering hikes through the desert.\n        An article by Gina Kolata in The Times today describes the slow and belated recognition of the problem. A South African expert who has been warning of the dangers for more than two decades told Ms. Kolata that he had not found a single case when an athlete had died from dehydration in a competitive race, but that some people had sickened and died from drinking too much. Typically, an overdose of water dilutes their blood and reduces the concentration of sodium. Water enters the cells, causing them to swell, and engorged brain cells press into the skull; such pressure can lead to confusion, seizures and a loss of vital functions.\n        All too often, friends, coaches or emergency personnel assume that the problem is dehydration and administer yet more liquid, making the problem worse. The best treatment is a small volume of a concentrated salt solution, given intravenously, to increase blood sodium concentrations. Sports drinks containing electrolytes may not help much as they are mostly liquid themselves.\n        In the 2002 Boston Marathon, for example, a 28-year-old woman found herself exhausted after running for five hours and gulping sports drinks along the way. Wrongly assuming that she was dehydrated, she chugged down 16 more ounces of a sports drink. She promptly collapsed and was later declared brain-dead. The concentration of salt in her blood was found to be lethally low.\n        In the study published today, researchers at various Harvard-affiliated institutions tested 488 of the nearly 15,000 runners who completed the 2002 Boston Marathon. They found that 13 percent had blood with abnormally low sodium levels, and that three runners were in danger of dying. It was not the elite runners who were at risk -- it was those who had taken four hours or more to finish the race, allowing plenty of time to imbibe excess fluid.\n        Sports authorities have already issued warnings and tips to avoid excessive drinking, and rescue workers in the Grand Canyon now carry devices to test collapsed hikers for low blood sodium. But the solution is for overly eager endurance runners and hikers to forget the old mantra that they should drink-drink-drink. Too much liquid can be lethal.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1853974,"ids":1853974,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"For years, President Bush has made the grandiose claim that the Congressional authorization to attack Afghanistan after 9\/11 was a declaration of a ''war on terror'' that gave him the power to decide who the combatants are and throw them into military prisons forever.\n        Yesterday, in a powerful 2-to-1 decision, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit utterly rejected the president's claims. The majority made clear how threatening the administration's policies are to the Constitution and the rule of law -- and how far the administration has already gone down that treacherous road.\n        Mr. Bush, the majority said, does not claim these powers for dire emergencies but ''maintains that the authority to order the military to seize and detain certain civilians is an inherent power of the presidency, which he and his successors may exercise as they please.''\n        The prisoner in this case, a citizen of Qatar named Ali al-Marri, was living in the United States legally when he was arrested and charged with being an Al Qaeda terrorist. In 2003, Mr. Bush declared Mr. Marri an enemy combatant, took him from civilian authorities and threw him into a military brig where he remains today without charges being filed.\n        The court did not say Mr. Marri was innocent, nor that he must be set free. It said that the law does not give Mr. Bush the power to seize a civilian living in the United States and declare him to be an enemy combatant based on whatever definition he chooses to apply. If Mr. Marri is to be kept in prison, it said, he must be tried and convicted in a civilian court.\n        The ruling said the Constitution and numerous precedents made it clear that foreigners living legally in this country have the same right to due process as any American citizen. It found no merit in the president's claim that the Congressional approval of the use of military force in Afghanistan gave him authority to change that or that he has ''the inherent authority'' to do it on his own. Sanctioning that kind of authority ''would have disastrous consequences for the Constitution -- and for the country,'' the judges said.\n        The judges said their ruling applied only to people living legally in the United States and not to the prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. But the court's powerful arguments may be relevant to a large number of those men. Steven Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the ruling would not help those prisoners who were captured on a battlefield and properly imprisoned as combatants. But there are hundreds of prisoners who were not taken on a battlefield but instead were picked up by the military or intelligence agents around the world and classified as combatants because of their association with Al Qaeda. The ruling said that was not an adequate definition of combatant.\n        This ruling is another strong argument for bringing Mr. Bush's detention camps under the rule of law. Congress can do that by repealing the odious Military Commissions Act of 2006, which endorsed Mr. Bush's twisted system of indefinite detentions, by closing Guant\u00e1namo Bay and by allowing the courts to sort out the prisoners -- not according to the whims of one president with an obvious disdain for the balance of powers, but by the rules of justice that have guided this nation for more than 200 years.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1827077,"ids":1827077,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"For years, the agency set up to encourage more affordable housing in New Jersey, the Council on Affordable Housing, has done almost nothing. And even when it has come up with a program, its rules seemed devised to allow municipalities to evade, not meet, their legal obligations to promote affordable housing.\n        A three-judge state appeals court panel decided last month it was fed up. In a unanimous, 127-page decision, the court said the rules drawn up by the council ''frustrate, rather than further'' the opportunity to build affordable housing. The court also said that the council had grossly underestimated the state's needs for low- and moderate-income dwellings. The judges gave the council six months to devise a new plan with more realistic estimates of the state's affordable housing needs.\n        For their part, the council and the League of Municipalities call the decision a setback for a genuine effort to provide housing for people with low and moderate incomes. But that's simply untrue. The council has approved plans for only four of New Jersey's 566 municipalities, and its rules would not have come close to providing enough affordable housing units. Some background is in order.\n        In the mid-1970's, a series of rulings by the state Supreme Court required communities to provide significant amounts of low and middle income housing. These were known as the Mount Laurel rulings after the town near Philadelphia where the complaints originated in 1971. In 1999, after various delays, the affordable housing council was instructed to devise guidelines. The council took until 2004 to write the rules and since then has approved plans for only the four towns.\n        The council's tortoise-like pace is only one of its shortcomings. It has apparently failed to consider broader regional needs as the Mount Laurel decisions required, and has thus underestimated by as many as 100,000 units the state's overall need for affordable housing. The council has also allowed towns to restrict half of their affordable housing units to senior citizens in order to avoid increases in school populations. The court said no more than one-quarter of the units can be reserved for seniors.\n        What's worrisome is that the very same council that has done such an abysmal job so far will now be asked to write a new plan. Based on the record, it is hard to have much confidence in the council and its leadership, including its chairman, state Community Affairs Commissioner Susan Bass Levin.\n        One remedy may lie with Gov. Jon Corzine, who to his credit has promised to create an additional 100,000 affordable housing units. He could ask the state's Department of Public Advocate to draft an effective plan and present it to the housing council. Historically, the public advocate, which was abolished by the Whitman administration but revived by Mr. Corzine, has been an enthusiastic advocate of more affordable housing for New Jersey. That same degree of commitment is now essential if New Jersey is to get the affordable housing it needs.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1754723,"ids":1754723,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Forty years ago a transit worker leader was led off to jail over an illegal walkout by the city's subway workers and bus drivers. He did not go quietly. ''The judge can drop dead in his black robes,'' Michael Quill memorably said, enshrining himself as a martyr in labor lore. Last week a Brooklyn judge sentenced Roger Toussaint, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, to 10 days in jail for ordering another strike last December. Mr. Toussaint did not say anything nearly as quotable. But going to prison for the membership always tends to raise the status of a union leader. And it does not ensure labor peace, or end the transit workers' contract disputes with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It's a punishment that doesn't suit the crime.\n        The transit strike violated the state's Taylor Law, and as a result, more than 33,000 members of Local 100 have had their paychecks docked for time missed and penalties. Mr. Toussaint and other union leaders were personally fined. While the M.T.A. did not ask for the 10-day jail sentence, it is seeking maximum financial retribution from the union, which would deprive Local 100 indefinitely of $20 million annually from automatic dues collection.\n        By any measure, Local 100 has completely botched up its efforts to improve things for the clerks, drivers, conductors and maintenance workers who keep the subways and buses running. Rank-and-file members followed up their strike by shooting themselves in the other foot when they rejected by the slimmest of margins a contract that would have given them almost everything they wanted. Mr. Toussaint -- confident that members now understand that -- is conducting a second vote. It could be for naught. There's nothing that compels the M.T.A., which manages the transit system, to even acknowledge the outcome. The contract has been sent to binding arbitration at the M.T.A.'s request.\n        Unless the M.T.A. reconsiders and finds a way to accept a second union vote that is expected to affirm the initially rejected agreement, workers may have to give up benefits that were protected under the deal they rejected, including a retirement age of 55 and millions of dollars in rebates for members who overpaid into their pensions.\n        Right now the M.T.A. has the upper hand. Whatever financial remediation the authority seeks should be aimed in part at reminding leaders of other public employee unions that there will be severe consequences for illegal strikes. But there is no reason to alienate the rank-and-file workers unnecessarily, to punish individual leaders in ways that simply improve their status within the union or to destroy the union's ability to represent its members fairly in grievance procedures or future contract negotiations. Stiff fines or a temporary suspension of checkoff privileges seems reasonable. Jailing Mr. Toussaint or trying to eliminate the dues checkoff forever seems counterproductive.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1820704,"ids":1820704,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Four major bills have recently been offered in the Senate calling for mandatory controls on carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas. And last week, 10 big companies, including General Electric, Alcoa and progressive utilities like PG&amp;E of California, joined in an informal coalition to press Congress and President Bush for action.\n        All of this has been accompanied by considerable fanfare. But at least as important was a quiet little letter to the members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce from its new chairman, John Dingell.\n        A Michigan Democrat who in recent years has opposed stronger fuel economy standards for automobiles, Mr. Dingell is, at best, agnostic on global warming. But he said he would put climate change at the top of the committee agenda this year and, for good measure, would invite Al Gore -- whose documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth'' has raised public awareness of the issue -- to testify first.\n        Mr. Gore should quickly accept. Mr. Dingell's support will be essential to any real progress on curbing emissions. In recent years, serious discussion of climate change has been largely confined to the Senate. But laws must be passed by both chambers, and if anything is to happen in the House, it will need Mr. Dingell's participation and consent.\n        That is the main reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi established a select committee on global warming last week -- not to end-run Mr. Dingell's powers, which she can't really do, but to elevate an issue she regards as important and to pressure Mr. Dingell to take a leadership role.\n        Mr. Dingell is 80 now, a formidable warrior who during 51 years in the House has played a pivotal role in pushing through nearly every cornerstone environmental law, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and laws protecting wilderness and endangered species. But while he supported fuel economy standards years ago, his loyalties to Detroit have led him to oppose further restrictions. As for global warming, he has said that he needs to be convinced that the consequences are truly worth worrying about, and if they are, that the problem can be addressed without bankrupting the country.\n        Hardly a believer, in other words, but plainly open to persuasion. Which is why it's essential for Mr. Gore and others to become part of the conversation Mr. Dingell has invited. In the end, what is most likely to move him forward is not pressure from Ms. Pelosi or anyone else but appeals to his well-documented sense of environmental stewardship.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1839716,"ids":1839716,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Four years ago this week, as American troops made their first, triumphant entrance into Baghdad, joyous Iraqis pulled down a giant statue of Saddam Hussein. It was powerful symbolism -- a murderous dictator toppled, Baghdadis taking to the streets without fear, American soldiers hailed as liberators.\n        After four years of occupation, untold numbers killed by death squads and suicide bombers, and searing experiences like Abu Ghraib, few Iraqis still look on American soldiers as liberators. Instead, thousands marked this week's anniversary by burning American flags and marching through the streets of Najaf chanting, ''Death to America.''\n        Once again, tens of thousands of American troops are pouring into Baghdad. Yesterday the Pentagon announced that battle-weary Army units in Iraq would have to stay on for an additional three months past their scheduled return dates.\n        Mr. Bush is desperately gambling that by stretching the Army to the absolute limits of its deployable strength, he may be able to impose some relative calm in the capital. And he seems to imagine that should that gamble succeed, the Shiite-dominated government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki will, without any serious pressure from Washington, take the steps toward sharing political power and economic resources it has tenaciously resisted since the day it took office a year ago.\n        Unless Mr. Maliki takes those steps -- eliminating militia and death squad members from the Iraqi Army and police, fairly sharing oil revenues, and rolling back laws that deny political and economic opportunities to the Sunni middle class -- no lasting security gains are possible. More Iraqi and American lives will be sacrificed.\n        Even among Shiites, who suffered so much at the hands of Saddam Hussein and who are the supposed beneficiaries of Mr. Maliki's shortsighted policies, there is a deep disillusionment and anger. This week, a Washington Post reporter interviewed Khadim al-Jubouri, who four years ago swung his sledgehammer to help knock down the dictator's statue. Mr. Jubouri said that ever since he watched that statue being built he had nourished a dream of bringing it down and ushering in much better times.\n        Now, with friends and relatives killed, kidnapped or driven from their homes, the prices of basic necessities soaring and electricity rationed to four hours a day, Mr. Jubouri says the change of regimes ''achieved nothing'' and he has come to hate the American military presence he once welcomed.\n        Mr. Maliki's supporters can be even more frightening to listen to. This week's demonstration in Najaf was organized by the fiercely anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, whose political party and militia helped put Mr. Maliki in power and are still among his most important allies.\n        Two months into the Baghdad security drive, the gains Mr. Bush is banking on have not materialized. More American soldiers continue to arrive, and their commanders are talking about extending the troop buildup through the fall or into early next year. After four years, the political trend is even more discouraging.\n        There is no possible triumph in Iraq and very little hope left.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1710559,"ids":1710559,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Fresh from an election that showcased him as a modernizing reformer, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan has now made a point of publicly embracing the worst traditions of Japanese militarism. Yesterday he made a nationally televised visit to a memorial in central Tokyo called the Yasukuni Shrine. But Yasukuni is not merely a memorial to Japan's 2.5 million war dead. The shrine and its accompanying museum promote an unapologetic view of Japan's atrocity-scarred rampages through Korea, much of China and Southeast Asia during the first few decades of the 20th century. Among those memorialized and worshiped as deities in an annual festival beginning this week are 14 Class A war criminals who were tried, convicted and executed.\n        The shrine visit is a calculated affront to the descendants of those victimized by Japanese war crimes, as the leaders of China, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore quickly made clear. Mr. Koizumi clearly knew what he was doing. He has now visited the shrine in each of the last four years, brushing aside repeated protests by Asian diplomats and, this time, an adverse judgment from a Japanese court.\n        No one realistically worries about today's Japan re-embarking on the road of imperial conquest. But Japan, Asia's richest, most economically powerful and technologically advanced nation, is shedding some of the military and foreign policy restraints it has observed for the past 60 years.\n        This is exactly the wrong time to be stirring up nightmare memories among the neighbors. Such provocations seem particularly gratuitous in an era that has seen an economically booming China become Japan's most critical economic partner and its biggest geopolitical challenge.\n        Mr. Koizumi's shrine visits draw praise from the right-wing nationalists who form a significant component of his Liberal Democratic Party. Instead of appeasing this group, Mr. Koizumi needs to face them down, just as he successfully faced down the party reactionaries who opposed his postal privatization plan. It is time for Japan to face up to its history in the 20th century so that it can move honorably into the 21st.\n        Editorial\n        Correction:  October 29, 2005, Saturday  An article last May 24 about China's anger at plans by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan to visit the Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo, regarded by many Chinese and others as a symbol of Japan's militaristic past, misstated the outcomes in the prosecutions of the 14 Japanese war criminals memorialized there. (The error also occurred in a related article on May 25 and in an editorial on Oct. 18 about Mr. Koizumi's visit to the shrine on Oct. 17.) Seven, not all, were executed; four were sentenced to life imprisonment, one was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment and two died during trial.

''My visit should send a signal to the people of Mongolia that you've got a friend in the United States and a friend in George W. Bush,'' the president recently told an American Christian and Mongolian TV station.\n        The White House seems to have trouble finding uncomplicated nations that support America's Iraq policy to which Air Force One can be pointed. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in Mongolia only a few weeks ago, expressing American gratitude for the same soldiers. We wish the president a nice trip, but before he gets to Mongolia, he has some other work to do: getting America's critically important relationship with China back on track.\n        For the last year, America's love-hate relationship with China has been more hate, less love. The United States seems to be on the run, fueled by the false perception that China's rapid economic rise poses an inevitable threat to America. This summer, a hostile United States Congress effectively blocked a Chinese government-owned company, Cnooc, from buying Unocal. A dozen or so proposals floated around Capitol Hill for across-the-board tariffs against Chinese imports. Just days ago, the textile industry got Washington to strike a deal with China limiting imports of bras and socks.\n        Last week, a bipartisan advisory group delivered a report to Congress that sharply criticized China's trade practices and endorsed imposing sanctions, including a tariff on imports, unless Beijing takes forceful steps to allow its currency to move in line with market forces.\n        The White House has indicated that Mr. Bush plans to raise the currency issue when he meets the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, this weekend. Certainly Mr. Bush should urge China to move toward a more market-based currency. With China's yuan undervalued, Chinese goods are cheaper in the Unites States and American goods are more expensive in China, which is one reason the trade deficit with China is so big.\n        But Mr. Bush must resist the advisory group's shortsighted calls to hit Beijing over the head with the blunt instrument of trade sanctions. Smacking China until it complies with us on trade is a short-range policy that doesn't take into account that it is now a political as well as an economic global power. There is more at stake in the world than how many made-in-China T-shirts are on sale at Wal-Mart.\n        Part of the reason it was so hard for America and Britain to get the humanitarian crisis in Darfur onto the United Nations Security Council agenda last year was that China resisted calls to pressure the Sudanese government. Similarly, any attempt to impose United Nations economic sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program now risks running into opposition from Beijing.\n        We hope that Mr. Bush's talks with Mr. Hu will extend beyond the usual trade and yuan complaints and into the entire canvas of the relationship between these two global giants. Washington must start thinking smartly about how it deals with Beijing, and what, beyond China's vast market of 1.3 billion people, it wants out of this relationship.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1818264,"ids":1818264,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"From all the ruckus raised by the administration and its patrons in the pharmaceutical industry, you would think that Congressional Democrats were out to destroy the free market system when they call for the government to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Yet a bill scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives today is sufficiently flexible to allow older Americans to benefit from the best efforts of both the government and the private drug plans.\n        The secretary of health and human services should be able to exert his bargaining power with drug companies in those cases in which the private plans have failed to rein in unduly high prices -- leaving the rest to the drug plans. The result could be lower costs for consumers and savings for the taxpayers who support Medicare.\n        Under current law, written to appease the pharmaceutical industry, the government is explicitly forbidden from using its huge purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. That job is left to the private health plans that provide drug coverage under Medicare and compete for customers in part on the basis of cost.\n        The Democrats' bill would end the prohibition and require -- not just authorize -- the secretary of health and human services to negotiate prices with the manufacturers. That language is important since the current secretary, Michael Leavitt, has said he does not want the power to negotiate.\n        No data is publicly available to indicate what prices the private health plans actually pay the manufacturers. But judging from what they charge their beneficiaries, it looks like they pay significantly more for many drugs than do the Department of Veterans Affairs -- which by law gets big discounts -- the Medicaid programs for the poor, or foreign countries.\n        The administration argues, correctly, that the private plans have held costs down and that there is no guarantee the government will do any better. The bill, for example, prohibits the secretary from limiting which drugs are covered by Medicare, thus depriving him of a tool used by private plans and the V.A. to win big discounts from companies eager to get their drugs on the list. The secretary does have the bully pulpit, which he can use to try to bring down the cost of overpriced drugs.\n        The bill also does not require the secretary to negotiate prices for all 4,400 drugs used by beneficiaries. A smart secretary could simply determine which prices paid by the plans seemed most out of line with the prices paid by other purchasers and then negotiate only on those drugs. The private plans are explicitly allowed to negotiate even lower prices if they can. This sort of flexibility should pose no threat to the free market. It is time for the Medicare drug program to work harder for its beneficiaries without worrying so much about the pharmaceutical companies.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1855644,"ids":1855644,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Frustrated at the lack of a good screening test for ovarian cancer, advocacy groups have persuaded professional cancer organizations to endorse a list of persistent symptoms that might indicate the presence of the disease. The list could have a very beneficial effect in alerting patients -- and doctors who have been dismissive of complaints of generalized discomfort -- that ovarian cancer is present at an early stage when it is most treatable.\n        Among the flood of patients who have the all-too-common symptoms, there will be some who undergo needless surgeries to remove ovaries that turn out not to be cancerous. That is the price that may be paid for this modest step toward detecting a cancer that typically kills most women who have it.\n        The need for early detection is clear. Ovarian cancer can be successfully treated when it remains in the ovary; the five-year survival rate for localized treatment is 93 percent. But the vast majority are not detected until the cancer has spread to distant sites, at which point the five-year survival rate drops to 30 percent. Unfortunately, all efforts to develop a screening test for early detection, analogous to mammography for breast cancer or a pap smear for cervical cancer, have thus far failed. The two most common -- a blood test for a potential tumor marker and a transvaginal ultrasound to detect abnormal growths -- are notoriously inaccurate.\n        What the new statement does instead is list symptoms that are much more likely to occur in women with ovarian cancer: bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly and urgent or frequent urination. Women who have these symptoms almost daily for more than a few weeks are advised to see their doctor.\n        Still there is a real quandary as to what should be done for women whose symptoms can't be attributed to other causes. The hope is that a combination of a pelvic and rectal exam, a blood marker test and transvaginal ultrasound -- none of which is determinative in itself -- might yield useful information. In the end, many women may opt for surgery to remove the ovary, just to be sure.\n        The real value of the statement may be to raise awareness. There are simply too many horror stories of doctors dismissing the complaints of patients as being ''all in their heads'' or as a sign of aging only to find out belatedly that an ovary was cancerous. The new statement puts them and their patients on alert that closer attention must be paid.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1800099,"ids":1800099,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Funny how a few weeks before the election Bush administration officials start hinting at timetables for getting American troops out of Iraq.

The Times's review of the unpublished ''notional political timetable'' suggests that it is a lot less demanding than advertised.\n        For example, it gives the Iraqi Parliament until December to outline the terms for demobilizing militias. But it sets no deadline by which Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki -- whose government is backed by two religious parties with powerful militias -- must disarm the militias. The day after Mr. Khalilzad announced the existence of a timetable, Mr. Maliki held his own news conference denying that he had agreed to anything.\n        The Iraqis weren't the only ones backpedaling. A day after the top American general in Iraq, George Casey, acknowledged that more troops may be needed to help stabilize Baghdad, his office issued a ''clarification'' saying that wasn't really what he meant.\n        And while General Casey suggested that the Iraqis should be able to provide their own security in 12 to 18 months, President Bush let slip that he had a far different timeline in mind. When asked at a news conference whether he would renounce any claim to permanent bases in Iraq, Mr. Bush said that was something for the Iraqi government to decide. He added, ''And, frankly, it's not in much of a position to be thinking about what the world is going to look like five or 10 years from now.''\n        This week we described what we believe must be done immediately to lessen the chances of chaos in Iraq after American troops withdraw. The Iraqis need to begin national reconciliation talks and disarm the militias. The Americans need to make a credible push to secure Baghdad and elicit the help of Iraq's neighbors.\n        There's no time left for notional timetables. Mr. Bush said the other day that ''we're making it clear to the Iraqis that America's patience is not unlimited.'' We hope it's clear to Mr. Bush that Americans have already lost patience with his bumbling conduct of this war, and the remaining grace period can be measured in months, not years.

Unfortunately, that is where the good news ends and a genuine horror story of this country's legal system begins.\n        The library in Georgia where Mr. Wilson works is in prison. He is two years into a sentence for engaging in consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a New Year's Eve party when he was 17. He won't be eligible for parole until he has served 10 years, essentially sacrificing his remaining youth to an obvious miscarriage of justice.\n        As Shaila Dewan reported in The Times this week, Mr. Wilson has been convicted of aggravated child molestation even though he and the girl were both minors at the time. Even if he could win an early release, Mr. Wilson could not go home to his family. He would have to register as a sex offender and would be prohibited from living with his 8-year-old sister. It is all the more disgraceful because the Georgia Supreme Court last week refused to hear his appeal.\n        The sexual act took place during a party involving sex, marijuana and alcohol, all captured on a graphic videotape. But that does not make Mr. Wilson a child molester. When high school students engage in consensual sexual activity, that is not the same as an adult molesting a teenager or a teenager molesting a child.\n        What makes this case more absurd is that if Mr. Wilson and the young woman had sexual intercourse, he would have been guilty only of a misdemeanor and not required to register as a sex offender, thanks to a provision in the law meant to avoid just this type of draconian punishment for consensual youthful indiscretions, the ''Romeo and Juliet'' exception. And since Mr. Wilson's conviction, the law has been changed to exempt oral sex as well. But the courts say that can't help Mr. Wilson retroactively.\n        His lawyer is planning to file a habeas petition seeking his release. The courts need to grant it and expunge his record so that Mr. Wilson can return to his family and his once promising academic career.

But no country was ever prosecuted for it until Bosnia accused Serbia of direct responsibility for the murder of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica. The World Court, which rules on disputes between nations, concluded that genocide did take place, and that while the Serbian government of that period had not directly ordered the murders, it ''could and should'' have acted to stop them, as the United Nations Convention on Genocide requires.\n        That nuanced distinction, based on evidence collected by the special tribunal that tried Slobodan Milosevic, the former Serbian leader, and other individuals accused of Balkan war crimes, spared Serbia from costly financial reparations. But it also established the official complicity of the former Serbian government.\n        That is something the current Serbian government now needs to acknowledge. Belgrade should also heed the court's formal order to turn over Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb general who directed the Srebrenica genocide.\n        The Darfur cases are being pursued in the International Criminal Court, which prosecutes individuals for grave violations of international law. The first two suspects sought for trial are Ahmad Harun, formerly Sudan's minister in charge of Darfur security, and Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman, a janjaweed militia commander. Mr. Harun is accused of inciting, financing and arming militia fighters to conduct genocidal attacks. Mr. Rahman is charged with directing one such attack that resulted in hundreds of deaths, systematic rapes and summary executions.\n        Court rulings can never compensate the survivors of these horrors. But by strengthening the reach and authority of international law, these cases should give pause to those tempted to unleash future genocides -- and to those who stand by.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1698793,"ids":1698793,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"George W.

In what seems to be a ritual in this administration, the president appeared a day later than he was needed. He then read an address of a quality more appropriate for an Arbor Day celebration: a long laundry list of pounds of ice, generators and blankets delivered to the stricken Gulf Coast. He advised the public that anybody who wanted to help should send cash, grinned, and promised that everything would work out in the end.\n        We will, of course, endure, and the city of New Orleans must come back. But looking at the pictures on television yesterday of a place abandoned to the forces of flood, fire and looting, it was hard not to wonder exactly how that is going to come to pass. Right now, hundreds of thousands of American refugees need our national concern and care. Thousands of people still need to be rescued from imminent peril. Public health threats must be controlled in New Orleans and throughout southern Mississippi. Drivers must be given confidence that gasoline will be available, and profiteering must be brought under control at a moment when television has been showing long lines at some pumps and spot prices approaching $4 a gallon have been reported.\n        Sacrifices may be necessary to make sure that all these things happen in an orderly, efficient way. But this administration has never been one to counsel sacrifice. And nothing about the president's demeanor yesterday -- which seemed casual to the point of carelessness -- suggested that he understood the depth of the current crisis.\n        While our attention must now be on the Gulf Coast's most immediate needs, the nation will soon ask why New Orleans's levees remained so inadequate. Publications from the local newspaper to National Geographic have fulminated about the bad state of flood protection in this beloved city, which is below sea level. Why were developers permitted to destroy wetlands and barrier islands that could have held back the hurricane's surge? Why was Congress, before it wandered off to vacation, engaged in slashing the budget for correcting some of the gaping holes in the area's flood protection?\n        It would be some comfort to think that, as Mr. Bush cheerily announced, America ''will be a stronger place'' for enduring this crisis. Complacency will no longer suffice, especially if experts are right in warning that global warming may increase the intensity of future hurricanes.

After two decades of failed efforts to bring more black and Hispanic officers into the pearly-white ranks of the Suffolk County Police Department, Mr. Levy, the county executive, wants to fix things with one bold, strange tweaking of civil service procedure.\n        He has announced plans to fill 20 percent of the next class of officer candidates with the top test scorers in the five Suffolk ZIP codes with the highest crime rates. Since these communities -- Bay Shore, Brentwood, Central Islip, Huntington Station and Wyandanch -- also happen to be largely nonwhite, Mr. Levy believes he has hit on a way to institute a racial preference that has nothing to do with race.\n        Who knows? It might work. Nothing else has in the 22 years since the Justice Department sued Suffolk for discriminating against women and minorities in police hiring. The county signed a consent decree in 1986 committing itself to increased minority hiring, but the diversity numbers have never budged. A program to smooth the way for black and Hispanic cadets was struck down in 1997 as unconstitutional reverse discrimination, and everything else the department has tried has been ineffective, to say the least. Today the population of Suffolk is 7.3 percent black and 12.6 percent Hispanic; its police force is 2.6 percent black and 7.3 percent Hispanic.\n        Mr. Levy's crime-zone strategy needs the approval of the Justice Department, and it remains to be seen whether state civil service law gives him the flexibility to try it. It seems unfair to denounce the idea as racist on its face, because any examination of our stratified landscape confirms that poverty, minority groups and crime (at least the blue-collar kind) tend to go together on Long Island. But it is fair to urge Mr. Levy not to apply this solution in isolation, and to insure that it does nothing to reinforce Long Islanders' toxic attitudes toward their less-advantaged neighbors. We will bet that we are not the only ones who winced when we heard that Mr. Levy was wading into the thickets of race and ethnicity again with his recruitment plan. He has shown a weakness for easy, camera-ready fixes, especially as they relate to minority groups -- seeking to solve the gang problem with aggressive sweeps through Huntington Station, for example, or the illegal-immigrant problem by bestowing federal powers on the county police.\n        Mr. Levy is welcome to try his scheme. But he should also give serious thought to making the department even more aggressive and creative in wooing qualified minority candidates -- particularly among college students, soldiers and veterans. That surely means more money, something the penny-wise Mr. Levy has not committed to. Adding black or Hispanic officers to the police recruiting unit would help (incredibly, it has none at the moment). So would addressing the frequent complaints of minority officers that their path to advancement on the force is often blocked.\n        The corporate world has long struggled to recruit qualified minority candidates. It is slow, hard, expensive work, though profoundly beneficial. Suffolk's failure to achieve even marginal success after 20 years strongly suggests that it is doing something wrong. The job itself is not a hard sell -- the competition to make six figures as a cop in sleepy Suffolk is as intense as ever -- so the flaw must be in the county's tactics or the scope of its effort.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1822970,"ids":1822970,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Given America's bitter experience in Iraq, one would think that President Bush could finally figure out that threats and brute force aren't a substitute for a reasoned strategy. But Mr. Bush is at it again, this time trying to bully Iran into stopping its meddling inside Iraq.\n        We have no doubt about Iran's malign intent, just as we have no doubt that Mr. Bush's serial failures in Iraq have made it far easier for Tehran to sow chaos there and spread its influence in the wider region. But more threats and posturing are unlikely to get Iran to back down. If Mr. Bush isn't careful, he could end up talking himself into another disastrous war, and if Congress is not clear in opposing him this time, he could drag the country along.\n        The drumbeat began during Mr. Bush's recent speech on Iraq, when he vowed to ''seek out and destroy'' Iranian and Syrian networks he said were arming and training anti-American forces. Mr. Bush also announced that he was sending a second aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf. Hours earlier, American troops raided an Iranian diplomatic office in Iraq. If anyone missed the point, aides let it be known that the president had authorized the military to kill or capture Iranian operatives in Iraq.\n        Iran certainly is helping arm and train Shiite militias. But the administration is certainly exaggerating the salutary effect of any cutoff as long as these militias enjoy the protection of Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. If Mr. Bush is genuinely worried -- and he should be -- he needs to be as forceful in demanding that Mr. Maliki cut ties to these groups and clear about the consequences if he refuses.\n        In what passes for grand strategy in this administration, the president's aides say he is betting that bloodying Iranian forces in Iraq, and raising the threat of a wider confrontation, will weaken Tehran's regional standing and force its leaders to rethink their nuclear ambitions. Never mind that Mr. Bush's last big idea -- that imposing democracy on Iraq would weaken Iran's authoritarians -- has had the opposite effect.\n        Mr. Bush seems to be grossly misreading Iran's domestic politics and ignoring his own recent experience. In a rare moment of subtlety, the Treasury Department has quietly persuaded some banks and investors to rethink their dealings with Tehran. That has made some in Iran's permanent religious elite -- already worried about future oil production -- express doubts about President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's defiance of the Security Council.\n        As ever, the one tactic the administration is refusing to consider is diplomacy. Mr. Bush has resisted calls to convene a meeting of Iraq's neighbors to discuss ways to contain the crisis. There is no guarantee that Mr. Ahmadinejad can be persuaded that Iraq's further implosion is not in Iran's interest. But others in Tehran may have clearer heads. And any hope of driving a wedge between Iran and Syria will have to start by giving Damascus hope that there is a way in from the cold.\n        Mr. Bush's bullying may play well to his ever shrinking base. But his disastrous war in Iraq has done so much damage to America's credibility -- and so strained its resources-- that it no longer frightens America's enemies. The only ones really frightened are Americans and America's friends.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1850221,"ids":1850221,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Given past mistakes -- including one in 2004 in which a fighter jet accidentally fired on a school -- one would think that officers at a bombing range at the edge of the Pine Barrens in southern New Jersey would be especially careful to avoid further blunders.\n        Nevertheless, earlier this month, an F-16 jet dropped a flare during a training mission and set off a fire that burned about 17,000 acres of forest land, destroyed and damaged numerous homes and forced thousands of residents to evacuate.\n        Officials and residents of Barnegat Township, where several homes in two trailer parks for the elderly were incinerated, were as much bewildered as they were dismayed that the Air National Guard conducted the exercise on a windy day when the fire danger was greatest. Several residents of the trailer parks, where the charred hulks of numerous trailers, cars and boats still remained, said the Guard, which is supposed to be in the business of protecting people, should have had more sense.\n        ''They are very careless, '' said Debbie Callahan, standing outside Pinewood Estates, one of the trailer parks that suffered damage. ''They should do these exercises in the desert.''\n        All training at the range at Warren Grove has been suspended pending an investigation by military authorities, and Gov. Jon Corzine said last week that he believed the facility should be shut down permanently.\n        The Warren Grove Gunnery Range has been part of the New Jersey Air National Guard since 1960, but it is used for combat training for all military air and ground forces, as well as by some non-military government agencies. Fighter and helicopter units from around the northeastern United States practice at the range day and night.\n        In the last eight years, there have been at least three other incidents involving the range, each of which endangered people living nearby. A fire in 1999 destroyed about 11,000 acres of pinelands. In 2002, an F-16 fighter jet crashed near the Garden State Parkway.\n        And in 2004, another F-16 from the range accidentally shot at least eight rounds of cannon ammunition at the roof of a school in Little Egg Harbor. Fortunately, the school was unoccupied except for a custodian, and no one was hurt.\n        This time the military is acting quickly to repair its relationship with residents, many of whom continue to voice support for the facility. Air Force officials have set up a redemption center at one of the trailer parks, and the military has promised to reimburse families for the value of their losses and offered immediate cash outlays of up to $25,000.\n        All that is good, but it may be too late to save the range.

The chances of that would be better still if New York's new governor, Eliot Spitzer, would commit himself and the state to a cause that needs all the friends it can get.\n        Mr. Spitzer should quickly commit himself to establishing ambitious goals for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from cars, power plants and other industrial sources in New York State, and to writing regulations to achieve those goals. That will mean butting heads with powerful constituencies like the utilities, but Mr. Spitzer has always enjoyed a good fight. And with California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, already committed, Mr. Spitzer's intervention could tip the national debate and compel Washington to move more quickly than it might have to endorse meaningful federal legislation.\n        California has pointed the way. Last fall it became the first state to mandate reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from every sector of the economy. The plan calls for reducing such emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, with a longer-range goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050. A state law already requires automobile companies to begin producing more fuel-efficient cars. And in January, Mr. Schwarzenegger ordered refineries and other fuel producers to reduce emissions by 10 percent, largely through the development of alternative fuels. California has also warned that it will stop buying electricity from power producers outside the state that produce heavy carbon dioxide emissions.\n        This would be a hard act to follow for any governor, but to some extent Mr. Spitzer's path has already been smoothed by his predecessor, George Pataki. Mr. Pataki joined with California in demanding more fuel-efficient cars and increased funds for energy-efficiency programs, and he directed that by 2013 one-quarter of New York's power must be produced by renewable fuels. And -- perhaps most important -- Mr. Pataki enrolled New York in an effort to reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions involving seven Northeastern states.\n        Mr. Spitzer, who built a formidable environmental record of his own as attorney general, has endorsed all of these programs. But he will have to go further if he intends to match Mr. Schwarzenegger. Among other things, he must help get the regional greenhouse initiative up and running, and make sure that any new power plants built to meet the state's energy needs use the most modern technologies and add as little as possible to the atmosphere's already heavy carbon burden.\n        This is a tall order even for an aggressive new governor. But the good news is that most of what Mr. Spitzer must do can be accomplished by executive order, thus skirting an unadventurous Legislature that tends to prefer business as usual.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1666940,"ids":1666940,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Given the huge sums the Bush administration has lavished on the military, it is astonishing to learn that the Navy may not be able to buy all the new ships it needs. The Navy has no one to blame but itself, and its appetite for overequipped ships.\n        The most glaring example of that is the DD(X) destroyer program. The DD(X) is a marvel of advanced technology. But its most costly features are not relevant to the battles the Navy is likely to fight, and its outsized price tag of well over $3 billion per ship leaves dangerously little for the aircraft carriers, submarines and fast coastal-combat vessels that will be needed in the years ahead.\n        In the post-9\/11 world, the Navy must prepare for combat against terrorists who melt in and out of rivers and harbors and ram explosives-packed boats into sitting warships. This will require more light and cheap craft, suitable for fast pursuit and patrol missions, and fewer megaships, designed for traditional warfare. Earlier designs of the DD(X) might have served these needs, had the Navy not insisted on layers of technology that needlessly added to the ship's weight and cost.\n        On average, the Navy can anticipate no more than about $10 billion a year for all of its shipbuilding needs. Much of that needs to go to renewing vital parts of the current fleet as they age. But that money simply won't be there if the Navy persists in spending $3 billion to $4 billion a year, as now planned, on the DD(X). Navy officials are aware of the problem but have not solved it. The only realistic answer is to jettison the DD(X) for a redesigned, more cost-effective large combat ship.\n        Unfortunately, America's military contracting system is biased against such a sensible outcome. Like the other services, the Navy does not know how to say no to impressive technology, whether it's needed and affordable or not. In addition, consolidation in the defense industry has left only two main contractors capable of producing the Navy's ships -- Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics -- and they apportion the business between them.\n        This absence of real competition significantly inflates costs, as does Congress's insistence on parceling out the work to as many of the six remaining major naval shipyards as possible. Lawmakers who represent these shipyards and their many subcontractors around the country constitute powerful Congressional constituencies for building prestigious but expensive ships that actually diminish national security by starving more vital programs.\n        Nobody likes to see the shipbuilding jobs generated by the DD(X) put at risk. But weakening the Navy's future fighting strength is too high a price to pay for insulating a few thousand workers from the harsh realities of economic life.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1794668,"ids":1794668,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Globalization brings wealth and opportunity to many people around the world. But to poor slum dwellers in the failing state of Ivory Coast, it has brought horrible sickness and death after hazardous waste, shipped nearly halfway around the world, was stealthily dumped in backyards around Abidjan. This need not and should not have happened.\n        As reported in Monday's Times by Lydia Polgreen and Marlise Simons, the waste -- a fuming mix of petrochemicals and caustic soda -- that started out in the Mediterranean and ended up in Africa could have been safely disposed of earlier in its journey. But Trafigura, the Swiss trading company that leased the tanker, balked at paying European prices. Instead, 85,000 people ended up seeking medical treatment, and at least eight have died.\n        The details and legal responsibilities are still being sorted out. But the lesson is plain. Without strict, and strictly enforced, international rules on waste disposal, dangerous cargos will find the course of least resistance, least cost, and least regulation, scarring the lives of some of the world's poorest, worst governed and most defenseless people.\n        This story began in July, when a Greek-owned Panamanian-flagged tanker, leased by Trafigura, stopped in Amsterdam and attempted to unload its waste. That fell through when a Dutch company that had contracted to do the job for $15,000 found far more noxious material in the ship's hold than it had been led to believe. Completing safe disposal there would instead cost $300,000, plus perhaps as much again in delays.\n        That sent Trafigura looking for cheaper alternatives. But for a company that had revenues of $28 billion last year, it was not a prohibitive price -- especially considering what happened. The ship moved on to several more ports, ending up in Abidjan, where Trafigura hired a local disposal company that did the nocturnal backyard dumping.\n        Trafigura says the Ivoirian authorities told it that the local company could do the job safely. If that is true, those officials were recklessly incompetent. In any case, a stronger system of international regulations -- backed up by a threat of fines or other penalties -- might have forced Trafigura to think twice about whom it was hiring.\n        Unless such regulations are tightened and reliably enforced, the sick and the dead in Ivory Coast will have suffered for nothing. And the whole story will soon be repeated in some other country where costs are low, rules are slack, and, as an inevitable result, human life is cheap.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1700573,"ids":1700573,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was a profile in timidity this week when he vowed to veto a pioneering bill authorizing gay marriage in California. The bill, which both houses of the Legislature passed by narrow margins, would expand the definition of marriage to include a civil contract between two people, not exclusively a man and woman. This was an enlightened and fair-minded stand that made California's Legislature the first in the nation to approve same-sex marriages.\n        Too bad Mr. Schwarzenegger could not find the courage to sign the bill into law. Instead, even before receiving the bill, he announced a tortured rationale for vetoing it. For years, social conservatives have accused judges of deciding social issues that should be left to legislators. Now Mr. Schwarzenegger wants to ignore his Legislature and leave gay marriage to the courts or the voters at large to decide.\n        He relies on a fig leaf: five years ago, Californians voted overwhelmingly for a ballot measure that recognized only heterosexual marriages as valid. A statement by the governor's press office declared, ''We cannot have a system where the people vote and the Legislature derails that vote.''\n        That ignores the fact that five years is an eternity in the fast-moving arena of gay rights. Even though 61 percent of the voters approved the ballot measure, recent polls show that the electorate is now evenly split, with Democrats and independents favoring same-sex marriage and Republicans strongly opposed. The Legislature is hardly a renegade body if it roughly mirrors popular opinion.\n        Mr. Schwarzenegger also seems to have forgotten that this nation was founded as a republic, in which the citizens elect legislators to govern on their behalf. Such representative democracy is especially important when it comes to protecting the fundamental rights of minorities, who may face bigoted hostility from some segments of the electorate.\n        It's easy to guess why Mr. Schwarzenegger was in such a hurry to announce his veto. Although he was initially hailed as a centrist Republican superhero who could appeal to a broad range of voters, his popularity has plummeted, and polls show that most Californians are inclined to oppose his re-election. Only his Republican base continues to back him.\n        Mr. Schwarzenegger's own views of gay marriage are hidden beneath vague, elusive, sometimes contradictory comments that add up to ducking the issue. The former Mr. Universe who has derided political opponents as ''girlie men'' is afraid to say what he really thinks.

Eliot Spitzer and members of the Legislature have been talking about overhauling a campaign finance system that allows big donors, in effect, to pay politicians to write state laws (or not write them) the way the donors want. It's not supposed to be that blatant, of course, but connecting the dots between campaign contributions and legislation in Albany has become child's play.\n        The high cost of campaigning has helped tighten the link between campaign donors and legislators. Just last week, Craig Johnson, a Democrat, won the right to represent parts of Nassau County in the State Senate after a campaign that cost a whopping $5 million. Mr. Johnson, a reformer, should now join forces with Mr. Spitzer and make New York's law a gold standard for the country.\n        Public Financing. The top priority should be public financing of campaigns. Other states offer such financing, as does New York City. The city's financing system is not perfect, but it succeeds in nurturing an astonishing number of competitors in City Council elections. Many lawmakers fret about the costs of such a system, though these are likely to be far less than the costs of the extras that the big donors manage to add to the state budget.\n        What the legislators do not mention is that public financing encourages competitive elections. In Albany, competition is a dirty word.\n        Full Disclosure. If public financing is too big a stretch for New York's calcified Legislature, members at least ought to try for the most basic upgrade: disclosure rules that make it easier for the public to find out who is paying for what.\n        The national Campaign Disclosure Project -- which grades disclosure practices in every state -- gave New York a D-plus in its latest ranking in 2005. Some of New York's disclosure operations have improved since then, but more detail is required. Donors should list their names and employment. Bundlers, people who collect contributions as a bundle, should be identified clearly, and there should be more people at the State Board of Elections to enforce these new requirements.\n        Stricter Limits. The guidelines are so generous that an individual donor can contribute more than $50,000 in each election. And contributions to political parties are virtually unlimited.\n        Corporate Contributions. These should be banned altogether. The present limit -- $5,000 from any corporation per year to all candidates -- seems reasonable. But corporations find ways around it.\n        Albany Fund-Raisers. Nearly every night when the Legislature is in session, one politician or another holds a fund-raiser, often in the state office building. Lobbyists drop by to hand out checks to politicians willing to sell out voters during the cocktail hour. These fund-raisers should be banned.\n        Finally, something should be done about the creative use of contributions that are intended to be used for campaigning. You are not supposed to use these funds to renovate your home.

He wants to turn away from a financial system that rewards political favorites to one that focuses on what regular people -- students, patients, taxpayers, workers -- actually get when New York spends a stunning $120 billion. That emphasis has resulted in one of the boldest, bravest budget proposals in Albany in many years.\n        Mr. Spitzer's most innovative move throws out the calcified state education formula, which cheats poor, urban school districts, and directs substantially more money to the schools that need it most. He is proposing universal prekindergarten care, which is critical to helping the most disadvantaged children, and he wants to build in accountability to ensure the money is well spent.\n        It would be difficult to get the new formula through the Legislature without something to win over suburban and upstate lawmakers. Mr. Spitzer has offered to cut property taxes by $6 billion statewide over the next three years, with the biggest cuts going to the middle class.\n        He also wants to overhaul the $45 billion Medicaid system, which spends more per capita than any other state. The Spitzer solution would shift money away from hospitals and nursing homes and toward expanded health care, including health insurance for all New York children. Unions, hospital advocates and politicians have already begun to raise the alarm. But the governor is right to fight for a fairer, more cost-effective distribution of public funds.\n        Mr. Spitzer has chosen other worthwhile battles.

Eliot Spitzer has announced he wants a sprawling Indian casino in the Catskills. In order to get it, he plans to go to Washington to lobby the secretary of the interior for final approval.\n        Mr. Spitzer has his reasons. There is the promise of economic development for people desperate for jobs. There is the reward of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the state that do not have to come from higher taxes. And finally, there is the newer rationalization that if New Yorkers are going to gamble anyway, they might as well lose their money in New York, not New Jersey or Connecticut.\n        But as any gambler knows, as dazzling as things look in the casino business, the odds are never stacked in your favor. Mr. Spitzer should realize that these shorter-term rewards will not turn out to be a good deal for New Yorkers in the long run. The costs in crime and social problems are barely figured in. For that reason alone, the secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, who as governor of Idaho opposed the kind of land deal this casino will require, should stick to his guns now that he is in Washington.\n        The casino for the St. Regis Mohawk tribe would be at the Monticello Raceway site, about 90 miles north of New York City. It could be as big as 13 football fields, drawing as many as six million visitors a year, and bringing with it a corresponding increase in traffic.\n        Enviromentalists, however, assert that the federal government has so far failed to perform a comprehensive assessment of the project's impact on the human and natural environment, as required under the National Enviromental Policy Act. The casino's proponents argue that the raceway was built long ago to accommodate crowds. But a gambling casino could draw even more people, and the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sullivan County Farm Bureau have sued the department for failing to do the required studies. Can anybody really argue that so many cars will not significantly affect the human environment?\n        Mr. Kempthorne has long argued that casinos belong on tribal land.

Eliot Spitzer has fearlessly taken on two of the most thankless jobs in New York State government: reining in health care spending and fixing the education financing formula. Anybody who has watched television recently knows why politicians are reluctant to try to make health care spending more rational. The health care workers' union has spent millions of dollars on commercials accusing Mr. Spitzer of being heartless and unwise. Meanwhile in Albany, Republican state senators have declared war over Mr. Spitzer's proposals on how education dollars get spent.\n        On health care, the union commercials make it sound as though Mr. Spitzer wants to fire nurses recklessly and make life more difficult for the elderly. The governor's proposed budget may not give health care workers everything they want, but it wisely tries to reorient spending toward the patient. Although one ad includes a nursing-home resident plaintively urging the governor to reconsider his plans, Mr. Spitzer has promised that such residents should not suffer under his changes to the health care system. It is important to realize that the governor is calling for cutting only $1 billion from a Medicaid budget that will grow to $47 billion next year, or almost a third of total state spending.\n        As for education, Republican senators from Long Island in particular have always demanded that they get the same percentage, or ''share,'' of all education money. Mr. Spitzer's budget would give out education funds based on need, not automatic percentages of the total pot. But Mr. Spitzer has tried to soften the pain for upstate areas and suburbs by offering them more property tax relief.\n        This education fight is what is really slowing the budget right now, but Mr. Spitzer should hold firm. The state's education formula is badly outdated, and reform has been too long in coming. What is especially troublesome is how the four Republican senators from New York City -- Frank Padavan, Martin Golden, Serphin Maltese and Andrew Lanza -- are standing with their leaders in Albany even though their city would do better with the governor's budget. If budget negotiations deteriorate to the point that New York returns to its old financing formulas, these four will be wearing that failure around their necks.\n        The governor and the Legislature have one more week to agree on a budget. New Yorkers would best be served if, by the April 1 deadline, all sides agree to a budget that carries out Mr. Spitzer's vision of reform.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1845385,"ids":1845385,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Gov. Eliot Spitzer has now added his voice to the chorus of New York lawmakers imploring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct a thorough, independent safety inspection at the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan -- not the routine maintenance and oversight that the commission insists is all that's needed, but a special, meticulous, top-to-bottom review that includes experts from outside the region and input from the state.\n        Mr. Spitzer is right to do so. The plant is aging and seemingly snake-bit, wrapped in a perennial fog of missteps and glitches and public-relations embarrassments.\n        It leaks tritium and strontium.\n        Its sirens continually fail.\n        And its unplanned shutdowns are so frequent they seem to follow a schedule.\n        That's oxymoronic, but that's Indian Point for you. Now that Entergy Nuclear Northeast has officially submitted its application for 20-year extensions of Indian Point's two reactor licenses, concerns about ineptitude and decrepitude are more relevant than ever.\n        Mr. Spitzer is walking a potentially delicate line. Though conservation and efficiency can do much to reduce demand, New York State will need to increase supply, while striving to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels as well as its greenhouse gas emissions. It is hard to imagine achieving either objective without including some nuclear power in the energy mix. As badly as people may want to pull the plug on Indian Point -- particularly those living in its shadow in New York City and the Hudson Valley -- it's still too early to do so. Mr. Spitzer's responsible call for tougher inspections should not be construed as a campaign to blow a hole in the state's power grid.\n        There is, however, no contradiction in recognizing the need for clean-burning nuclear plants and the critical importance of making them impeccably safe and secure.\n        Not everyone seems to get that. Mr. Spitzer's original budget sought to charge New York's nuclear plants $13 million to help pay the state for using National Guard for security; that proposal was killed in the Legislature, to the delight of the energy companies, which had argued that it was only fair that they be allowed to shuck off that expense.\n        And on one basic point -- reliable warning sirens -- Entergy seems bafflingly incompetent and lackadaisical, having missed repeated deadlines to install a functioning system. It was recently fined $130,000 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for blowing its April deadline; the company now promises to have a plan in place by the time the next deadline rolls around.\n        Plans are one thing. Working sirens are another. Indian Point's chronic missteps have badly strained public confidence, something that its owners and federal regulators should make it a priority to restore. They should start, at the very least, with an independent safety assessment.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1816679,"ids":1816679,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Gov. Eliot Spitzer is fond of saying that you can't change the world by whispering. What New Yorkers saw in his first week in office was a governor in full trumpet about how to overhaul their state government. While some veterans of state politics saw Mr. Spitzer's State of the State speech on Wednesday as too ambitious, former Gov. Hugh Carey got it just right. ''It's a very big agenda,'' he said, ''but it's not too big for New York.''\n        We are still in the promising stage, of course, and the real test will begin later this month with Mr. Spitzer's first executive budget. But he has begun by laying down a number of important, and sensible, markers. On health care, he wants insurance for all children. He hopes to find some of the money to do this by consolidating hospitals and shifting patients from nursing homes to at-home care.\n        On education, Mr. Spitzer says he wants to spread money out more fairly to students who most need it. Suburban lawmakers whose schools are favored by the current formula will object. But he may win them over with his plan to lower property taxes that fall heavily on middle-class suburbanites.\n        He made a strong pitch for economic revitalization upstate, a familiar but elusive goal of a long line of New York politicians.\n        Mr. Spitzer also proposed a series of reforms that are certain to rile legislators accustomed to lifetime tenure in Albany. He intends to create a nonpartisan redistricting commission and vowed to veto any future district lines that are gerrymandered to make elections uncompetitive. And he wants to ''replace the weakest campaign finance laws in the nation with the strongest.'' That means lowering contribution limits and providing public financing so that moneyed interests can no longer buy political clout.\n        Also on Mr. Spitzer's ambitious to-do list, and appropriately so, are restructuring the courts and organizing the overlapping local governments across the state.\n        Mr. Spitzer faces two major hurdles. One is finding top-flight appointees to make these proposals a reality. One of the most important sales jobs he has now is convincing enough good people that working for government wages is worth it to help reinvent such a powerful state government. Mr. Spitzer's other challenge will be getting the Legislature to go along. Much of his speech was met with an odd silence from lawmakers. Perhaps it was the way Mr. Spitzer carved out new political territory that does not entirely cater to upstate Republicans or downstate Democrats. But it may simply be that they do not yet know what to make of all that urgency, all those promises, all that work.\n        Mr. Spitzer certainly acts like a man ready to go forward quickly. The goals he has set may be daunting to the old guard in Albany, but anything less from this governor would have been a grave disappointment.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":4,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1823405,"ids":1823405,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Gov. Eliot Spitzer's plan to freeze Medicaid payments at current levels for hospitals and nursing homes is causing understandable consternation among health care institutions that are already in precarious financial straits. But the governor's new budget proposal looks like a responsible way to free up money to help pay for a huge increase in state aid for education and subsidize the property tax cuts he deems necessary to win approval of his education proposals -- and accelerate much-needed reform in the way medical care is delivered.\n        New York currently spends roughly a third of the state budget, or some $46.5 billion, on Medicaid, far more than any other state. That makes Medicaid a reasonable place to look for savings. By ramping down the rate of growth, the governor's new budget proposes to save more than $1.2 billion from projected state spending on Medicaid and a related health program in the next fiscal year.\n        A portion of these savings would be used to provide health insurance for some of the 2.6 million New Yorkers who currently lack it, including 400,000 children. Mr. Spitzer proposes to increase the income limits for a joint state-federal program that insures children and to simplify the administrative procedures, with the expectation that in a very few years all 400,000 uninsured children may be covered. He also plans to reduce the bureaucratic hurdles that currently make it hard for adults eligible for Medicaid to enroll and stay enrolled.\n        All these steps combined, the governor estimates, should cut the number of uninsured people in half over the next four years. We fear that his projections are much too optimistic, but he is at least making a good-faith effort to cover low-income people. In sharp contrast, President Bush's proposal for tax subsidies for private insurance utterly ignores this most needy segment of Americans.\n        The heart of the governor's plan is to drive New York's health care system, now heavily reliant on high-cost care in hospitals and nursing homes, toward greater use of outpatient clinics, home care and primary care in the community. Virtually all health experts agree that is the way to go, not only in New York but in other high-cost states as well.\n        Mr. Spitzer's proposal assumes that freezing payments to hospitals and nursing homes will compel those institutions to manage themselves more frugally and bargain more aggressively with unions and private health plans. Lots of money sloshes through health care institutions from Medicare, Medicaid and private payers, so there should be room to absorb a temporary freeze while hospitals plan for a more constrained future. But the reimbursement system for health care is jerry-built with cross-subsidies to support vital services.\n        Hospitals have already complained that Medicaid fails to pay them the true cost of inpatient care and grossly underpays them for outpatient care, and now the governor wants to hold down payments still further. That is not a reason to oppose Mr. Spitzer's needed transition, but care must be taken to ensure that vital health care institutions are not damaged before alternatives are readily available.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1690554,"ids":1690554,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Gov. George Pataki announced yesterday that he would not run in 2006 for a fourth term. This is a wise course. Not only have the governor's recent polls looked a little pallid, but Mr. Pataki also knows from firsthand experience that New York State's voters begin to tire of their leaders after a while. In 1994, that fed-up factor -- with Gov. Mario Cuomo -- helped Mr. Pataki get elected in the first place.\n        It is too soon to give a full assessment of Mr. Pataki's performance. He has done well with the environment, but the rate of reform in Albany remains too slow. He still has time over the next year and a half, presuming he's not too busy in Iowa or New Hampshire, to fill gaps in his legacy as leader of New York State for a dozen crucial years.\n        As he goes into this final round in Albany, Mr. Pataki's actions may well be viewed through the filter of presidential politics because he is considered a potential candidate. Being on the national stage could help in some ways, in particular by making it important for him to add weight to his claims as a reformer. Mr. Pataki could, for example, push for revamping the campaign finance system, which he has done little more than talk about for years.\n        Mr. Pataki's actions on the morning-after pill, a bill soon headed for his desk, will send many signals as well. The governor already has a reputation among his fellow Republicans as a moderate who favors a woman's right to choose her options for contraception and early pregnancy. If he vetoes this bill and uses the weak argument that it is the federal government that should approve this contraceptive for over-the-counter use, he will please no one. Many women who have supported him will feel betrayed, and the conservatives won't be fooled. Better a profile in courage here than a waffle that makes him look bad to everybody.\n        Finally, if there is anything the Pataki name will be attached to in the future, it will be the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan after Sept 11. The governor speaks often about the attacks on the World Trade Center, but between now and his departure, he will have the extremely tough job of keeping the memorial and the rebuilding on course. He has to give the most vocal family groups their due, but not so much that they drown out everyone else. And he must make certain that ground zero doesn't become a cemetery or a narrow memorial that mocks the very freedoms Mr. Pataki has pledged to honor.\n        In his announcement, Mr. Pataki rallied those around him to ''get back to work.'' That was a good way to recognize that even if he is not running again for governor, Mr. Pataki and his administration still have 17 important months to run New York State.","adu_anecdote":3,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1793941,"ids":1793941,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Gov. George Pataki went to Yonkers last week and announced that the state would spend $34 million to expose the Saw Mill River to daylight. It would mean ripping up thousands of feet of concrete and blacktop under which the river now slinks unseen into the Hudson. A drainage culvert would thus become a second riverfront, with shady walkways and the burble of flowing water through the heart of downtown.\n        Of all the development projects being dreamed up for this proud but slightly sagging city -- and there are a great many -- the ''daylighting'' of the Saw Mill might have the richest combination of exemplary traits, qualities that should guide any effort by a community to reinvent itself. First, it's democratic, creating a public amenity that charges no admission while promising to greatly enhance life downtown for everyone. It's respectful of history -- downtown and the river have not been acquainted for many generations -- and the environment. Finally, it's unexpected, even a little audacious, using the imaginative thinking not always associated with contemporary urban planning, which too frequently involves a depressingly similar mix of big-box retail stores and cookie-cutter housing and offices.\n        But the rest of Yonkers's renewal plans may be another story. Huge changes are coming to this little city, from Ridge Hill in the north, where Bruce Ratner wants to build a $600 million ''village'' of shops, apartments and offices, down to the Hudson, where Collins Enterprises is erecting the second phase of a complex of hundreds of luxury apartments and a renovated ferry terminal will start sending commuters to and from Manhattan in the spring.\n        The biggest chunk in this wholesale overhaul is a $3.1 billion partnership of three developers -- Cappelli Enterprises of Valhalla; Struever Brothers Eccles &amp; Rouse of Baltimore and Fidelco Realty Group of Millburn, N.J. -- to bring homes, offices and stores across dozens of acres downtown. The developers have a pedigree (Cappelli Enterprises has helped make downtown White Plains gleam again, and the other developers have created admired projects in places like Baltimore, Providence and Newark), but it's too soon to tell whether all the moving parts will add up to a successful whole.\n        The most troubling component of the plans is a riverfront high-rise that threatens to be 30 stories tall and loom over the water like a misplaced and stranded chunk of lower Manhattan. The environmental group Scenic Hudson, which has long been a voice for sensible and proportional development, opposes the tower at that oppressive height, and the City Council and mayor should listen to its concerns.\n        Yonkers is a big city, but one of its most lovable traits is its small-town density and intimacy, the hustle and flow of its streets lined with mom-and-pop shops and its funky aura of bygone heavy industry. The people guiding Yonkers's renewal should not forget that the best kind of development -- like the long-overdue return of the Saw Mill River -- takes place on a humble, human scale.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1688384,"ids":1688384,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Gov. George Pataki will soon have a chance to sign a bill that would give New York's women the chance to get emergency contraceptives without a prescription. The governor, who has apparently been eyeing the possibilities of a 2008 run for president, may be thinking about the politics of this bill more than the science. If so, he should think about how this law could help cut down on unintended pregnancies for all women in New York state.\n        Over the years, Mr. Pataki has been recognized, especially among Republican women, as a politician who understands the need for women to have access to contraceptives. He has also made his name as a pro-choice Republican, approving, for example, a way for low-income women to gain access to the abortion pill, RU-486. Trimming those sails now for political purposes would not win over the hardest of the anti-abortion conservatives in his own party. It would merely offend his moderate Republican friends.\n        The bill heading for Mr. Pataki's desk was approved swiftly in the New York Legislature, in large part because the medication is a form of contraception, not abortion. The bill would allow a trained nurse or pharmacist to dispense a higher dose of a common oral contraceptive as a way to block pregnancy within 72 hours after unprotected sex. Seven other states have already passed similar legislation to cut down on teenage pregnancies and unintended pregnancies.\n        Some of those arguing for the governor's veto suggest that New York should wait for the Food and Drug Administration to approve these drugs for over-the-counter sales. So far, however, the F.D.A. has stalled this much-needed action, despite recommendations from its own advisory panels. So other states have moved forward, including California, Alaska, New Hampshire and New Mexico.\n        So far, there are signs that teenage pregnancy rates in these states have dropped, and there have been few reported adverse reactions. And for those who argue that making this contraception available promotes illicit sex, a study reported in January by The Journal of the American Medical Association indicated otherwise. That makes sense. It's hard to imagine that more people, and especially more young people, will decide to have sex merely because they can buy expensive doses of contraceptives the next morning at local drugstores.\n        Governor Pataki has a decent record of providing women better control over their own reproductive health.

Jon Corzine's terrible accident has focused attention on two unfortunate habits that seem endemic to New Jersey governors. One is the ridiculously high number of unimportant appearances they make around the state, and the other is the reckless driving that gets them there -- or, in Mr. Corzine's case, doesn't.\n        Anyone who has watched New Jersey governors during the past 40 years or so cannot help but be astounded by the amount of time they've squandered racing around the state from one insignificant function to another. On many days they spent far more time in a car and at dinners, campaign fund-raisers and senior citizen events than in the office they campaigned so hard to get to.\n        On April 12, the day of Mr. Corzine's car crash, he attended the funeral of an F.B.I. agent in Pennsylvania, went to Hackensack to preside over a pact between feuding Democratic party factions, drove about 130 miles to Atlantic City to speak to a mayors' conference, and was traveling to Princeton to attend a meeting between the talk show host Don Imus and the Rutgers women's basketball team when the accident occurred.\n        Except for the funeral of the F.B.I. agent, who had been shot while on duty in New Jersey, all of these appearances could have been dispensed with, especially at a time when mammoth tax, fiscal and social problems confront the state.\n        Lest we put too much blame for this practice on Mr. Corzine, however, it must be noted that almost since the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway opened in the 1950s, governors have been zooming around the state to one or another political, municipal or social function, even though none of this bears any real relationship to what voters had in mind when they went to the polls.\n        And then there's the matter of speed. Aides to Mr. Corzine's predecessors concede that their bosses, too, exceeded speed limits, even in non-emergency situations. New Jersey should quickly join other states in forbidding governors and their drivers from speeding, and from using their flashing red lights, except for genuine emergencies.\n        There is a reasonable alternative: the helicopter. Mr. Corzine's staff apparently considered using a helicopter on April 12, but rejected the idea because of bad weather. Most New Jersey governors have avoided using helicopters since the 1990s, when their alleged overuse became a campaign issue.\n        But a helicopter would be a far better choice than racing up and down the highways and endangering public safety. And should a governor worry that it might be hard to explain why a helicopter was used for a political meeting or any other non-essential appearance, a better alternative is at hand: stay in the office and do the job the people elect a governor to do.\n        We sympathize with Mr. Corzine, who now faces long and arduous physical therapy.

New Jersey's voters, unaccustomed to this flurry of government activity at the height of the Shore season, will be watching with the most intense sort of interest -- self interest.\n        Based on their own rhetoric and promises, the Governor and the lawmakers really have no choice except to deliver meaningful reforms, even if some of those reforms put voters in a foul mood going into next year's legislative elections. The issue at hand is nothing less than the state's fiscal stability, now and in the future; Mr. Corzine and the legislative leaders have pledged to take that issue head-on.\n        Raising expectations in this way is a bold and counter-intuitive strategy because it does not leave a great deal of room for failure, especially with an electorate that has so often been disappointed in the past. If the brave talk of summer leads to a series of tepid proposals that only nibble around the edges of reform, voters may conclude that drastic changes are required in the Legislature -- a chilling thought for incumbents going into an election year.\n        So it speaks to a certain kind of courage that legislators have promised to be serious about tackling issues like regionalizing cherished local services and changing school funding formulas. In the past, these and other issues have been studied, debated, and left to die of neglect in the name of political expediency. Today's financial crisis is the result of yesterday's delaying actions.\n        Solving the property tax issue will require more than finding the money to issue larger rebate checks. It will require legislators to understand that the old ways are dead, and it is their job to dissect the remains in hopes of finding the clues that will lead them to a cure. If they are serious about this examination, they will find arteries clogged by the effects of wasteful and inefficient spending, and political muscle left to atrophy by candidates who preferred solutions that required no heavy lifting.\n        If they cannot or will not find a cure for what ails New Jersey, voters may discover one of their own.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1799251,"ids":1799251,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Gov.

But residents also responded to her personal warmth and her emphasis on high ethical standards. She brought together reluctant members of both parties to pass a campaign finance law.\n        Now Governor Rell is running for election against Mayor John DeStefano of New Haven, a Democrat. Both Mrs. Rell and Mr. DeStefano are good candidates. But they have real differences.\n        Mrs. Rell has shown a good sense of priorities. She put billions of dollars into transportation, a pressing but long-ignored need. She put money into pilot programs to provide preschool to poor children and promises to expand them. She has kept state bonding in check and used a large budget surplus this year to reduce pension liabilities and state debt.\n        Mr. DeStefano, the underdog, has encouraged a real discussion of the state's many problems. He wants to provide health coverage for the uninsured by closing corporate tax loopholes, a priority for the leaders of the Democratic-controlled Legislature. He's talked about a windfall profits tax on energy and about lowering residential property taxes. These are good ideas. Voters will also undoubtedly notice that some of them are unnervingly expensive.\n        The biggest concern about Mr. DeStefano's candidacy is something that he has no control over -- the enormous political imbalance created by the decline of the Connecticut Republican Party. If he is elected, Connecticut will have, in effect, one-party rule; the Democrats are two votes shy of a veto-proof majority in the Legislature.\n        It strikes us that Connecticut would be better off with a moderate Republican governor now. And Mrs. Rell has clinched the sale in her short time in office by showing the potential to be a great governor as well as a popular one. Her record has a few flaws. Mrs. Rell, for all her emphasis on high standards, adopted a see-no-evil approach to a lapse in ethics of her chief of staff. Her election campaign has been lackluster. She hasn't wanted to risk her lead by debating the big issues, and she hasn't appointed enough of her own people to top jobs.\n        When Mrs. Rell decides an issue is worth fighting for, like campaign finance reform, she's impressive. But so far her vision has been too modest. It would be a real tragedy if Mrs. Rell wasted her popularity by just tinkering with the state's big problems.

So now it's time for the team to step up to the plate and help build the station, which could cost $40 million. Otherwise, funds will have to be diverted from other, long-delayed and more important mass transportation projects.\n        The Yankees, who have already stuck taxpayers with part of the bill for new parking garages, bristle at the thought of helping with transportation costs. But that's ridiculous posturing, and shortsighted as well. A Metro-North station would be good not only for the community but the team, whose Westchester fans have to drive or take a circuitous mass transit route to get to the Bronx. The mayor, governor and City Council should insist that the Yankees do their part.\n        We have already applauded the Yankees for their willingness to shell out more than $800 million to build the stadium itself. The Mets, who unveiled an Ebbets Field-inspired design for a new field of their own last week, deserve similar praise for agreeing to pay some $700 million. Financially, the two New York teams have not asked for the sort of free ride at taxpayer expense that has been commonplace elsewhere. But New York is not any other city. A stadium here is guaranteed to be wildly lucrative for the host team. And the city and state have been generous. The Mets will get at least $165 million in public assistance for infrastructure and other costs. The Yankees -- whose deal is more complicated because they would consume land in two public parks -- will receive at least $200 million in taxpayer help, not counting the train station.\n        On top of that, both teams want help through tax-exempt bonds and tax-alternative payments that could save each club tens of millions.\n        The Yankees worked hard to win over Bronx officials with a community benefits agreement. Some of it is the stuff of bread and circuses: 15,000 free tickets for distribution every season (hopefully not just to the well-connected). And some of it is real, including $1 million for job training and hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual community grants.\n        The Yankees also promise to spend $8 million on improving local parks, which should partly compensate for the green space the stadium will take away. On the whole, the agreement is a good start toward restitution for the many years in which the team, the richest sports franchise in the land, largely ignored residents of the disadvantaged South Bronx.\n        The team should be similarly forthcoming on the Metro-North station. It would be in the club's interest to do so. A Metro-North station could diminish the need for expensive parking garages, and reduce air pollution and congestion, making for happier fans and healthier neighbors. On this, the Yankees should not expect a free ride.","adu_anecdote":17,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1673625,"ids":1673625,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Hardly a week goes by without somebody telling President Bush that his passive approach to global warming is hopelessly behind the times, that asking industry for voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions won't work and that what's needed is a regulatory regime that asks sacrifices of everyone. He's heard this from his political allies here and abroad -- from Tony Blair, George Pataki and Arnold Schwarzenegger, to name three -- and now he is hearing it from the heaviest hitters in the business world, including, most recently, Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric.\n        Mr. Immelt runs the biggest company in America, and for that reason some environmental groups hailed his speech last week on climate change as a tipping point in the global warming debate. Mr. Immelt chose his words carefully and did not directly criticize Mr. Bush. But he left no doubt that he believes mandatory controls on emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, are necessary and inevitable. And he said he would double investments by G.E. in energy and environmental technologies to prepare it for what he sees as a huge global market for products that help other companies -- and countries like China and India -- reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\n        Mr. Immelt's speech is not the only sign of impatience among Mr. Bush's business allies. In New York, two dozen leading institutional investors managing more than $3 trillion in assets recently urged American companies to address the risks of climate change and to invest more heavily in strategies to reduce those risks. They met under the auspices of the United Nations Foundation and Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmental interests.\n        Perversely, the administration insists that all this voluntary activity will eliminate the need for a national strategy. Yet these gestures represent only a small slice of the economy; industry as a whole will not spend money to reduce emissions as long as the rules (or, more precisely, the absence of rules) confer a competitive advantage on the businesses that do nothing. Indeed, it is precisely to achieve a level playing field that more and more big utilities -- the very companies Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney thought they were letting off the hook -- are now calling on Congress to consider mandatory controls.\n        Absent a response from the administration, which still maintains, incredibly, that there is insufficient scientific understanding to justify mandatory limits, the country's best hope for meaningful action at the national level rests with the Senate, which will shortly take up an energy bill.\n        The bill by itself would not impose limits on emissions, although there is some talk that Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman may offer a bill imposing industrywide caps as an amendment on the Senate floor. But a properly drawn energy bill has the potential to do much good, especially if it avoids rewarding the old polluting industries, as the House version does, and focuses instead on putting serious money behind cleaner fuels, cleaner power plants and cleaner cars. That these measures would also ease the country's dependency on overseas oil is, of course, a persuasive side benefit.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1777850,"ids":1777850,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Having recovered in body if not spirit from a historic budget battle, state legislators and Gov. Jon Corzine will reconvene in Trenton later this month for a special session devoted to property tax reform. The governor has indicated he wants an expansive agenda, with legislators considering everything from consolidating local government services to new formulas for school spending.\n        In other words, Mr. Corzine wants more than a quick fix that will keep voters happy and content going into next year's legislative elections. Everything has to be on the table, the governor said, if the state's elected leaders are serious about changing New Jersey's reliance on property taxes.\n        Curiously, the other voice calling for sweeping change is the governor's recent antagonist, the Assembly speaker, Joseph Roberts Jr. of Camden County, who has offered an ambitious agenda that dares speak of things like shared local government services.\n        Like Mr. Corzine, Mr. Roberts understands that reducing New Jersey's dependence on property taxes will require a drastic overhaul of government service delivery. And such an effort could make the recent budget stalemate seem as civilized as a black-tie dinner party.\n        New Jersey has too many local governments (566, to be precise) delivering too many services. It has more school districts (616) than municipalities. Its school spending formula pits special-needs urban schools against better-off neighbors in the suburbs. Its pension system is in shambles, and is becoming worse by the year. There is not nearly enough accountability over spending at all levels of government.\n        If state legislators and the governor are going to deliver systemic reform of the way Trenton does business, they'll have to tackle these and other difficult issues. Otherwise, whatever they deliver will be little more than just another election-year gimmick, this one all the more cruel because it will be disguised as meaningful reform.\n        And that, of course, is the danger of overpromising. Mr. Corzine could have signaled something less ambitious, something that would alienate nobody save for the next generation of taxpayers. Instead, he wants legislators to think big, to think about innovative financing and to think beyond next year's elections.\n        Sweeping changes clearly will require changes to the state Constitution. Unless the state's politicians lose their nerve, they will ask voters next year to approve a constitutional convention, to be held in 2008. Proposed constitutional changes would then appear on the '08 ballot.\n        All sides agree that the system is broken. It cannot be put back together by legislators armed with gluepots. Instead, the state requires something new. It is up to the legislators and the governor to build it.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1816678,"ids":1816678,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Here are a few bulletins from planet Earth:\n        Dec. 12 -- Exhaustive computer simulations carried out at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., suggest that the Arctic Ocean will be mostly open water in the summer of 2040 -- several decades earlier than expected. Scientists attribute the loss of summer ice largely to the buildup of carbon dioxide and other man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n        Dec. 14 -- Experts at NASA's Goddard Institute predict that 2006 will be the fifth-warmest year since modern record-keeping began, continuing a decades-long global warming trend caused, again, by the buildup of man-made carbon dioxide.\n        Dec. 27 -- The Interior Department proposes adding polar bears to the list of threatened species because of the accelerating loss of the Arctic ice that is the bears' habitat. The department does not take a position on why the ice is melting, but studies supporting the proposed listing identify greenhouse gases as the main culprit, adding that if left unchecked these gases will create ice-free Arctic summers in three decades.\n        But we knew that.\n        One can only assume that the Senate's new Democratic leadership is paying attention. California's Barbara Boxer is the new chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, replacing James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who regards global warming as an elaborate hoax drummed up by environmentalists and scientists in search of money. Ms. Boxer has already scheduled hearings, and there will be no shortage of legislative remedies to consider. All share one objective, which is to attach a cost to carbon dioxide through a cap on emissions.\n        The underlying logic is that if people and industries are made to pay for the privilege of pumping these gases into the atmosphere, they will inevitably be driven to developer cleaner fuels, cleaner cars and cleaner factories.\n        This is the path most developed countries have chosen. Europe has imposed caps on industrial emissions, and European companies have begun investing in new technologies and cleaner factories in places like China, partly as a way to meet their own obligations to cut emissions and partly as a way to lead China to a greener future.\n        These hearings need to be conducted in a thoughtful manner. There has been enough noise, from the Inhofe right and from the doomsayers who see each hurricane as a sign the apocalypse is upon us. But it is also important that Ms. Boxer and her colleagues not lose sight of a fundamental reality: Saturating the atmosphere with greenhouse gases is loading the dice in a dangerous game.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1835486,"ids":1835486,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Here is a tale that is hard to believe. A financially troubled state with more fiscal responsibilities than it can possibly meet is seriously considering spending millions of taxpayer dollars to bail out a money-strapped hospital in an area that already has too many hospitals.\n        The state is New Jersey, and the hospital is Pascack Valley, a 291-licensed bed facility in Westwood beleaguered by operating losses and an $80 million debt after a costly new construction project. A nearby hospital, the rapidly-expanding Hackensack University Medical Center, is interested in buying Pascack, but wants the state to put up $60 million to help it out.\n        The scheme might make some sense if Pascack were in an area with too few hospital facilities, but that is not the case. Located less than 10 miles away are four hospitals with more than 1950 beds among them. They include Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, which according to state figures has a recent occupancy rate of less than 45 percent of its licensed beds, and Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, with an occupancy rate of less than 65 percent of its licensed beds. Pascack Valley has about 45 percent of its licensed beds occupied.\n        Just about everyone concedes that New Jersey has too many hospitals in an age when patients are discharged much more quickly than they used to be. The state's newspapers are filled with stories of hospitals hovering near bankruptcy, up for sale, or asking the state for financial help. Gov. Jon Corzine last year established a commission to draw up an overall plan for how the state should allocate its health spending and which hospitals should be given financial assistance. While much of New Jersey has too many hospital facilities, some urban areas do not have enough, and the state does not come close to reimbursing hospitals for the full costs of treating uninsured patients.\n        To add to the satire, one of the two local state senators who want the state to consider the $60 million giveaway is Gerald Cardinale, Republican of Bergen County, a conservative who is usually regarded as a fiscal tightwad. Mr. Cardinale, who has said he does not want to see a worthy hospital go the way of the ''wrecking ball,'' argues that Pascack's current and past patients, its contributors and residents of the immediate area will be big losers if Pascack is allowed to die. But the same thing would be true for any hospital facing a shutdown.\n        Mr. Corzine, who recently made a bad mistake when he helped put together a plan for bailing out a bankrupt, underutilized hospital in his home city of Hoboken, would be repeating the error if he went along with the Pascack plan. At the very least, he should wait until his own commission completes its study. Surely, if it is needed, Pascack Valley can find a way on its own to stay afloat for another few months.\n        The necessity of not rushing into a state bailout is even more obvious in view of a recent report that Englewood and Holy Name hospitals are themselves thinking about the possibility of acquiring Pascack, apparently without state help. As for the medical center in Hackensack, if it believes the purchase of Pascack Valley is a worthwhile venture, it should do so without asking for taxpayer help.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1813763,"ids":1813763,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Here is the latest twist on Darfur's never-ending horrors: refugees from the neighboring Central African Republic have fled to Darfur recently as the killings and atrocities have spilled across Sudan's borders. If Darfur's grim tally -- several hundred thousand dead, two million driven from their homes -- can't persuade the world to act, then perhaps the threat of a regional conflagration will.\n        There is no lack of hand wringing. This month, President Bush's special envoy, Andrew Natsios, gave Sudan until Jan. 1 to allow a somewhat more robust peacekeeping force into Darfur. But Mr. Natsios did not say what price Sudan would pay if it continued to refuse, only that the Bush administration would move on to a classified ''Plan B.''\n        While Mr. Natsios's demands drew the usual sneers from Khartoum, Sudanese officials appeared genuinely spooked by news that the International Criminal Court's prosecutor would soon be ready to present war-crimes charges against those responsible for the atrocities in Darfur. One Sudanese legislator suggested that his government might drop its objections to United Nations peacekeepers in exchange for a promise of immunity from the court. That's a no-go. But it is also a sign that Khartoum is vulnerable to outside pressure if it is real. Even before the court moves, the United States should rally Western governments to freeze the assets of all Sudanese officials implicated in the genocide.\n        Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has called for imposing a ban on Sudanese military planes and helicopters flying over Darfur. That would at least stop them from bombing and strafing villages. Western planes could also attack janjaweed militias once they crossed into the Central African Republic and Chad. Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair should immediately press the Security Council to authorize the no-flight zone. If China balks they should make it a NATO mission. And if NATO balks, the two should enlist the support of France -- which has an air base in Chad -- and impose the ban themselves.\n        Mr. Natsios is a good diplomat. But the crisis needs someone with more clout, internationally and in Washington. Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair should jointly appoint a high-level envoy -- former President Bill Clinton or Richard Holbrooke, the Bosnia negotiator, come to mind -- to warn Sudan's protectors in China and the Arab world that the West is finally ready to act, with their backing or without it. The envoy would deliver the same message to Khartoum, along with an offer to negotiate a peace settlement. That's a good start on a Plan B, and years overdue.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1795082,"ids":1795082,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Here's a scenario to keep you up nights.

Meanwhile, over in the Middle East, Iran's neighbors start asking themselves why they should even wait for Tehran to go nuclear before starting their own programs.\n        Which is why the Bush administration, and other critical players, need to do a lot more to talk North Korea back from the nuclear ledge -- and to keep it there.\n        It has been months since negotiators even sat down at a table. And the two countries with the most potential leverage -- China and the United States -- have found it easier to play down the urgency of the threat than to do what's needed to deal with Pyongyang's undeniable craziness.\n        In China's case, that means delivering an unambiguous warning to its longtime client that a nuclear test will be followed by an immediate and painful reduction in Chinese subsidies and aid. And President Bush will have to make his own unambiguous commitment that the United States will not try to overthrow the North Korean government -- if it gives up its weapons program.\n        Experts still debate whether China got the North Koreans to the table by briefly cutting off oil deliveries -- or doling out cash. There's no doubt China has the leverage. But China's autocrats are so enamored of any status quo -- and so nervous about having to house and feed the North's refugees -- that they have resisted using it. Instead, Chinese officials say that the North probably hasn't built a weapon, or if it has, wouldn't ever use it. That's what we call being in denial. It is a luxury Beijing can no longer indulge.\n        Mr. Bush cannot indulge his own ambivalence over whether it would be better to negotiate with Kim Jong-il or try to overthrow him. North Korea may have the most erratic, brutal and opaque leadership in the world. And it's impossible to know whether the ''dear leader'' would really trade away his weapons program for any price. But this White House has yet to test him. In the most recent whipsaw, Mr. Bush agreed to offer economic and security incentives to Pyongyang but then undercut the offer by imposing new sanctions on North Korean banks. Pyongyang has refused to come back to the table ever since.\n        While you're contemplating nuclear dominoes, here's another reason to stay up at night. In its search for cash, North Korea has become expert at selling pretty much anything to anyone: counterfeit dollars, bootlegged cigarettes, ballistic missiles.

Lawmakers on Long Island, doing their part to prevent sexual abuse, are busily weaving a tight web of laws restricting where convicted sex offenders can live and lurk. The laws, like others around the country, are a sort of geography-based epidemiology, treating each sex offender as a one-man roaming toxic zone that must be kept at a rigorous distance from places where children gather.\n        The distances vary, with Suffolk County (a quarter-mile from schools, day-care centers and playgrounds) and Nassau (1,000 feet from schools, 500 feet from public parks) setting benchmarks that some communities are emulating. East Rockaway includes ''any school, place of worship, child day-care center, community center, public library, public park, playground and other recreational facility'' in its 1,000-foot no-go zones. The City of Long Beach is considering similar legislation, and since restricted areas would include its long, long beach, sex offenders could effectively be driven entirely out of that skinny city. Huntington Town is jumping on the bandwagon, with a bill expanding on Suffolk's list of restricted places and forbidding offenders to own or live in houses used as apartments.\n        The first thing that needs to be said about laws like this is that they are a sham. There is no evidence linking buffer zones to a reduction in sex crimes, and no way that buffer zones will do anything about the bulk of the sex-offender problem, which is the abuse of children by relatives and other people they know. The laws are simplistic, emotion-based formulas that cloak politicians in an aura of decisiveness while doing nothing to tackle a ferociously difficult problem.\n        The second thing is that they are a dangerous waste of law-enforcement time and resources. Police departments are already obliged under a welter of federal and state laws to register and monitor sex offenders. Prosecutors and sheriffs around the country have complained that adding map-reading and buffer-zone enforcement to their large and growing offender-management portfolios only hampers their ability to fight crime.\n        The final and most important point is that buffer zones and housing restrictions send offenders underground. We may all find these men fearsome and creepy, but if communities systematically banish them, denying them the chance to find housing and to lead stable lives under close supervision, they end up doing the logical thing. They congregate in unincorporated poor areas. Or they disappear.\n        Lawmakers stress how important it is to keep children safe.

Mrs. Clinton has been an excellent senator -- hard-working and in close touch with her state.

She has won the genuine respect of most of her colleagues in Washington, and she seems to have found a forum in which her lifelong wonkishness can be put to good use. It seems as if in the Senate, Mrs. Clinton has found her true calling.\n        The puzzle of this campaign is that she might not consider that a compliment.\n        Mrs. Clinton's intention to be a candidate for president in 2008, though unannounced, is hardly a secret. And the Republicans' failure to field a candidate of substance has allowed her to spend this fall running against George Bush. So far, the voters do not seem to mind.

Her extraordinary discipline might help her to avoid mistakes during a presidential campaign, to run a race that will not center on some symbolic slip-up. But can she conjure up a vision of the future for a nation desperately in need of inspiration and real leadership? Can she speak to the great issues of the day directly, without carefully trimming every sentence to steer clear of controversy?\n        The real question is not whether she can turn in continued good performance in the Senate, or even whether she can run a smart campaign for president. It is whether she can put some great idea ahead of her own political upward mobility, whether there is a cause so important to her that she will risk her political security for it.

Policy, ideology, ethics all gradually fall away, replaced by a political machine that exists to win elections and dispense the goodies that come as a result. The only surprise in Washington now is that the Congressional Republicans managed to reach that point of decayed purpose so thoroughly, so fast.\n        That House leaders knew Representative Mark Foley had been sending inappropriate e-mail to Capitol pages and did little about it is terrible. It is also the latest in a long, depressing pattern: When there is a choice between the right thing to do and the easiest route to perpetuation of power, top Republicans always pick wrong.\n        The news about Mr. Foley should have set off alarm bells instantly, even if the messages the leaders saw were of the ''inappropriate'' variety rather than the flat-out salacious versions that surfaced last week. But there was certainly no sense of urgency in their response, which seemed directed at sweeping the matter under the rug rather than finding out precisely what was going on.\n        The obvious first step -- notifying the bipartisan committee that oversees the page program -- was never taken, presumably because that would have meant bringing a Democrat into the discussions. After Mr. Foley assured everyone that he was simply engaged in mentoring, whatever leadership inquiry there was ended with telling him to stop e-mailing the youth who got the inappropriate letter.\n        It's astonishing behavior for a party that sold itself as the champion of conservative social values. But then so was the fact that a party that prides itself on fiscal conservatism managed to roll up record-breaking deficits, featuring large amounts of wasteful pork earmarked to the districts of powerful legislators or the profit sheets of generous campaign contributors. So was the speed with which the party that billed itself as the voice of grass-roots exurban and suburban America turned itself into the partner of every special-interest lobbyist with a checkbook.\n        The good news is that American democracy, so flawed in many ways, is often fairly efficient at punishing parties that become addicted to self-perpetuation.

The bill will be opposed by legislators beholden to religious conservatives. Many are likely to cite a new study suggesting that broadly useful stem cells can be derived from amniotic fluid without destroying embryos to get them.\n        The new study, while certainly intriguing, in no way lessens the need to widen the array of embryonic stem cells available for research and ultimately therapy. The Democrats' proposal is extremely modest -- about the least that could be done to accelerate progress in this promising field. It deserves support from veto-proof majorities in both houses.\n        Under the policy enunciated by Mr. Bush in 2001, federal money can be used to support research on only 20 or so stem cell lines that existed before the policy was set. Many of these cell lines are deteriorating or contaminated. And their number is far too small to allow the full range of research needed to explore the value of stem cells for treating Parkinson's, diabetes, spinal cord injuries and other serious ailments.\n        The Democrats' bill would expand the number of lines by directing the secretary of health and human services to finance research using human embryonic stem cells regardless of when they were derived. The source of these cells would remain highly restricted. No embryonic stem cells could be tailor-made to study specific diseases or therapies. The stem cells would have to be derived only from surplus embryos that were originally created for fertility treatments and would otherwise be discarded.\n        An alternative approach that attracted wide attention this week was described by scientists at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine. They extracted stem cells from the amniotic fluid of pregnant women and used them to create muscle, bone, fat, blood vessel, nerve and liver cells. These stem cells, spun off by the developing fetus, seem to have some -- though quite probably not all -- of the versatility that allows embryonic stem cells to grow into a wide range of body tissues. The fetal cells are easily obtainable from the amniotic fluid during amniocentesis, a diagnostic procedure often performed in the second trimester of a pregnancy.\n        Even so, it would be a mistake to use this promising research, which has yet to be replicated or fully accepted by other scientists, as another excuse for hobbling embryonic stem cell research. The days-old embryonic cells are likely more versatile than fetal cells extracted months later from amniotic fluid, and they allow a range of research on the very earliest stages of human development.\n        Stem cell research holds enormous promise, though top researchers say it could take a decade or more to develop useful therapies from it. At this point, it is important to explore all approaches: using ''adult'' stem cells, which can grow into a very limited range of body tissues; the cells found in amniotic fluid, which may yield a broader range of tissues; and the most versatile cells of all, those derived from early human embryos.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1826377,"ids":1826377,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"How do you explain to the thousands of American troops now being poured into Baghdad that they will have to wait until the summer for the protective armor that could easily mean the difference between life and death?\n        It's bad enough that these soldiers are being asked to risk their lives without President Bush demanding that Iraq's leaders take any political risks that might give the military mission at least an outside chance of success.

The FRAG Kit 5 helps slow the incoming projectile and contains some of the shrapnel, giving the soldiers a better chance of survival.\n        Armor upgrades like this have become a feature of the Iraq war, as the Pentagon struggles to keep up with the constantly more powerful weapons and sophisticated tactics of the various militia and insurgent forces attacking American troops. But the Army, the National Guard and the Marine Corps have been caught constantly behind the curve.\n        Unglamorous and relatively inexpensive staples of ground combat, like armor, have never really captured the imagination and attention of military contractors and Pentagon budget-makers the way that ''Top Gun'' fighter jets, stealthy warships and ''Star Wars'' missile interceptors generally do.\n        The Army says it is now accelerating its production of FRAG Kit 5 armor and handing it out to Baghdad-bound units on a priority basis. But it acknowledges that the armor upgrading project will not be completed until summer. Right now, it's February, and the new American drive in Baghdad has already begun.\n        That's a shame, if not an outright scandal, because up-to-date armor is essential for saving American lives.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1837731,"ids":1837731,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"How much effort should we expend to ward off the possibility that an asteroid might some day collide with Earth? Space experts attending a recent conference in Washington lamented the failure of the federal government -- indeed, of the entire world -- to take the threat seriously enough. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at virtually the same moment, advised Congress on steps that could be taken to find and divert threatening asteroids only to conclude that it couldn't afford them.\n        That seems shortsighted. The risk is remote, but the consequences are potentially catastrophic. It would seem wise, at a minimum, to look harder for any death-dealing rocks that might menace us.\n        The encouraging news is that the most horrendous hazards -- asteroids like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs or even smaller objects whose impact could disrupt the global environment -- have mostly been identified under a $4 million-a-year survey program. The space agency estimates that there are some 1,100 near-Earth objects whose diameters exceed six-tenths of a mile, big enough to destroy a medium-sized state and kick up enough dust to affect global climate and crop production. The survey has already identified more than 700 of them. None are on a path to collide with Earth.\n        More troublesome is the threat of smaller asteroids, greater than 460 feet in diameter (about one-seventh the threshold of the really scary big ones), that could devastate a region but not the whole globe. NASA estimates that some 20,000 of these might be potentially hazardous; it has identified only a fraction of them. Two years ago Congress asked NASA to propose new search programs and to analyze ways to divert any asteroids on a collision course with Earth. The agency did that in a March report to Congress, but it balked at the notion of spending up to $1 billion or more to build search instruments or spacecraft.\n        That is understandable. NASA is burdened with the need to finish the space station, build a successor to the shuttles, return to the moon and conduct wide-ranging research. It already has more jobs to perform than money to perform them. But finding asteroids that might threaten the planet, and studying their characteristics in the process, is probably more important than at least some of the other robotic missions mounted by NASA. Congress should either add funds to the agency's budget, or the agency should divert funds from other programs to accelerate the asteroid hunt.\n        Developing ways to deflect asteroids is more problematic. NASA suggests that the best solution would be to explode a nuclear bomb next to an asteroid to deflect it off course, but international aversion to nuclear weapons in space would make that approach difficult without a global consensus. Other experts favor a high-speed ballistic impact or using the gravitational attraction of a hovering spacecraft to nudge the asteroid off course. Before plunging ahead with an asteroid-deflector, let's wait to see whether a real threat even exists.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1842995,"ids":1842995,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"If President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney believe the belligerently partisan and misleading things they have been saying about Congress's war spending bill, their grip on the few options left in this disastrous war is even more tenuous than we'd guessed. The sooner Mr. Bush and his allies drop the pretense that military victory is still possible in Iraq and their charges of ''defeatism'' against those who know better, the closer the nation will be to rescuing what can still be rescued from the debacle.\n        Obviously, the White House and Congress will eventually have to arrive at some kind of compromise. But that compromise cannot be on the ''my way or the highway'' terms Mr. Bush is demanding. The fact is, Congress has served the country well by finally forcing open debate about how America can best extricate itself from Iraq while minimizing the long-term damage to itself and the Iraqi people.\n        The ''dramatically different'' military strategy Mr. Bush now claims to be carrying out in response to the frustrations voters expressed in last November's election is nothing fundamentally new at all. It is just an escalated version of the failed approach -- 99 parts military -- that the administration has clung to for the past four years.\n        It is actually Congress that is proposing a different and healthier approach by insisting on a serious political strategy, one that requires a genuine turn from the deliberately divisive policies of the radical-Shiite-led Iraqi government, policies that have been fueling civil war.\n        The war spending measure that the White House is now so frantically demonizing requires Mr. Bush to demand that the Iraqi government finally demonstrate measurable progress toward more conciliatory policies on oil, policing and employment discrimination.\n        Without such policy changes, American troops cannot hope to hold Iraq together, no matter how many thousands more are sent and how long they are ordered to remain. To give added force to American calls for political conciliation, the legislation links a specific timetable for the phased withdrawal of American combat troops to political progress.\n        If Mr. Bush has problems with the withdrawal dates Congress proposes, those can be negotiated. But if he refuses to insist on policy changes from Baghdad and acts as if American troops can stay in Iraq indefinitely, he throws away all leverage. That invites the worst kind of endgame: more chaos inside Iraq and, we fear, more chaos for the region when American troops leave, as they inevitably will.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1662353,"ids":1662353,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"If a background check shows that you are an undocumented immigrant, federal law bars you from buying a gun. If the same check shows that you have ties to Al Qaeda, you are free to buy an AK-47. That is the absurd state of the nation's gun laws, and a recent government report revealed that terrorist suspects are taking advantage of it. There are a few promising signs, however, that the federal government is considering injecting some sanity into policies on terror suspects and guns.\n        The Government Accountability Office examined F.B.I. and state background checks for gun sales during a five-month period last year. It found 44 checks in which the prospective buyer turned up on a government terrorist watch list. A few of these prospective buyers were denied guns for other disqualifying factors, like a felony conviction or illegal immigration status. But 35 of the 44 people on the watch lists were able to buy guns.\n        The encouraging news is that the G.A.O. report may be prodding Washington to act. The F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller III, has announced that he is forming a study group to review gun sales to terror suspects. In a letter to Senator Frank Lautenberg, the New Jersey Democrat, Mr. Mueller said that the new working group would review the national background check system in light of the report. We hope this group will take a strong stand in favor of changes in the law to deny guns to terror suspects.\n        In the meantime, Senator Lautenberg is pushing for important reforms. He has asked the Justice Department to consider making presence on a terrorist watch list a disqualifying factor for gun purchases. And he wants to force gun sellers to keep better records. Under a recent law, records of gun purchases must be destroyed after 24 hours, eliminating important information for law enforcement. Senator Lautenberg wants to require that these records be kept for at least 10 years for buyers on terrorist watch lists.\n        Keeping terror suspects from buying guns seems like an issue the entire nation can rally around. But the National Rifle Association is, as usual, fighting even the most reasonable regulation of gun purchases. After the G.A.O. report came out, Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s executive vice president, took to the airwaves to reiterate his group's commitment to ensuring that every citizen has access to guns, and to cast doubt on the reliability of terrorist watch lists.\n        Unfortunately, the N.R.A. -- rather than the national interest -- is too often the driving force on gun policy in Congress, particularly since last November's election. Even after the G.A.O.'s disturbing revelations, the Senate has continued its work on a dangerous bill to insulate manufacturers and sellers from liability when guns harm people. If it passes, as seems increasingly likely, it will remove any fear a seller might have of being held legally responsible if he provides a gun used in a terrorist attack.\n        An Insecure Nation: Editorials in this series remain online at nytimes.com\/insecurenation.\n        Editorial: An Insecure Nation","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1642371,"ids":1642371,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"If books were children, the ones in the Mount Vernon Public Library would be in foster care by now, and their parents locked up for neglect.\n        All through the library, Westchester's largest and most important, books are packed into carts, shrouded in sheets of plastic, hidden away behind locked doors where none but custodians ever go. Hundreds that were damaged by rain and mildew are gone, thrown out. The ones that remain in the old building -- once grand but now rotting, with brown-streaked walls and peeling paint, trash cans for catching drips, and bare concrete floor where sodden carpet was pulled up -- are imperiled every day that a complicated squabble over the status and future of the library remains unresolved.\n        That the library's condition is a disgrace is beyond argument. The library director, Rodney J. Lee, says he has struggled for years to get the City of Mount Vernon to pay for repairs. His $3.8 million budget is at least a million dollars too low, he says. After the costs of salaries and health insurance, there is barely enough left to keep the lights on, much less to make a dent in the multimillion-dollar renovations that the building needs. Mr. Lee says he has had to raid the operating budget over the years to make repairs -- usually after rainstorms send new cascades down the walls, through the wiring and light fixtures and into the basement.\n        The building's maintenance foreman, Jesse Vanlew, in fact, is forever on the alert for new leaks when it rains, even if it means unlocking the place at 3 a.m. Mr. Vanlew -- who spends a lot of his time at the hardware store, buying big rolls of plastic and tape -- does not have the resources to do this job. In poor Mount Vernon, where will the money come from to save this municipal treasure?\n        The strange fact is, a lot of money is already there. The city has floated more than $2 million in bonds to fix the roof and install air-conditioning (when it's hot, it's unbearable). Another $260,000 in federal money has been allocated. But very little has been spent. The thorough overhaul -- the one that will dry things out and restore some of the hardwood-and-stained-glass luster to this 1904 Andrew Carnegie library -- remains a plan on a desk somewhere.\n        This is where the political squabbling comes in. For reasons too complex to go into here, the library has been a victim of a situation in which authority over the library is divided several ways, assuring that no one takes ultimate responsibility. The city controls the library's finances, but the school board owns the building and appoints the trustees. The state Department of Education, which charters public libraries, wants to change the way the library operates by putting its budget and leadership to a public vote. Mayor Ernest Davis and a majority of thetrustees have objected furiously, saying the state is trying to shroud the library with an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. A legal battle looms.\n        The mayor's critics have accused him of letting the library fall apart as the standoff continues. Though his administration gives every indication of wanting to do things on the cheap, Mayor Davis says he is committed to making necessary repairs. The condition of the building suggests otherwise.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1784054,"ids":1784054,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"If competition is the lifeblood of democracy, then Connecticut is sorely in need of a stronger state Republican Party. The current three-way Senate race offers the Republicans their best shot at a Senate seat in nearly two decades. Yet even as Joseph Lieberman and Ned Lamont flailed away at each other in the Democratic primary, the G.O.P. failed to capitalize.\n        The main problem is Alan Schlesinger, its Senate nominee. Mr. Schlesinger has refused to step down despite revelations that two New Jersey casinos once sued him for gambling debts and that he gambled under the assumed name of ''Alan Gold'' at Foxwoods Resort Casino in the 1990's while he served in the State House of Representatives.\n        Both the Republican governor, M. Jodi Rell, and the state party chairman, George Gallo, have asked Mr. Schlesinger to step aside so the party can field a more viable candidate. His obstinacy has cost the party weeks in which it might have mustered some momentum. The party cannot force Mr. Schlesinger to quit. It has no rules enabling it to recall a candidate. And although at any time Mr. Schlesinger may have a change of heart and withdraw, the party is not in control of its own destiny as it should be.\n        But while the rules clearly need changing, the party's weaknesses run deeper. The state G.O.P. needs a major turnaround -- a stronger bench of competitive candidates and an overarching vision.\n        The last Republican senator from Connecticut was Lowell P. Weicker Jr. Since his defeat in 1988, the party has nominated so many uninspired candidates that it often appeared that it preferred Democratic incumbents, particularly Mr. Lieberman.\n        It is true that former Gov. John Rowland managed to stay in office for 10 years. Yet he seemed more interested in his own re-election than in building a stronger party. His successor, Governor Rell, has vowed to change this. The state has a big stake in whether or not she is successful. More than just a Senate seat is at risk.\n        The Republican presence in both houses of the General Assembly has slowly withered over the last several years. The Republicans have not controlled the State Senate in 10 years or the State House in 20. Aside from the governorship, the last statewide office the Republicans captured was that of state treasurer 10 years ago.\n        Since then, it has been a virtual Democratic sweep. This is not healthy for either of the two major parties in Connecticut and it is terrible for the state. Voters do not get the best legislation or representation from complacent incumbents. One-party rule is for politburos, not democracies.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1841791,"ids":1841791,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"If private health plans are supposedly so great at delivering high-quality care while holding down costs, why does the government have to keep subsidizing them so lavishly to participate in the Medicare program?\n        About a fifth of elderly Americans now belong to private Medicare Advantage plans, which -- thanks to government subsidies -- often charge less or offer more than traditional Medicare. As Congress struggles to find savings that could offset the costs of other important health programs, it should take a long and hard look at those subsidies.\n        The authoritative Medicare Payment Advisory Commission estimates that the government pays private plans 12 percent more, on average, than the same services would cost in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program. The private plans use some of this money to make themselves more attractive to beneficiaries -- by reducing premiums or adding benefits not covered by basic Medicare -- and siphon off the rest to add to profits and help cover the plans' high administrative costs.\n        Although the insurance industry insists that the subsidies are much lower and are warranted by the benefits provided, Thomas Scully, who headed the Medicare program for the Bush administration until 2003, told reporters recently that the subsidies were too large and ought to be reduced by Congress.\n        The largest private enrollment is in health maintenance organizations, which typically deliver care a bit more cheaply than standard Medicare and should not need their 10 percent subsidies, on average, to compete. The biggest subsidies -- averaging 19 percent above cost -- go to private fee-for-service plans, which are the fastest-growing part of the Medicare Advantage program. Unlike the H.M.O.'s, which at least manage a patient's care and bargain hard with doctors and hospitals, these plans ride on the coattails of standard Medicare, typically providing access to the same doctors and paying them at the same rates. Thanks to the big subsidies they get, such plans are often a good deal for beneficiaries, charging less for the same benefits or adding benefits without raising prices.\n        The main losers are the beneficiaries in the standard Medicare program, whose monthly premiums are roughly $2 higher to help pay for the subsidies, and the taxpayers who pick up part of the tab. The subsidies also erode the long-term solvency of Medicare, which needs to rein in costs, not increase them with handouts to insurance companies.\n        When the Democrats first won control of Congress, it seemed possible that they might eliminate the subsidies -- saving some $54 billion over five years -- to finance a $50 billion expansion of a health insurance program for low-income children. But the insurance industry has mounted a furious lobbying campaign to head off any cuts.\n        Congress ought to eliminate the subsidies completely unless it is willing to subsidize the same benefits -- at enormous cost -- for the far greater number of people enrolled in standard Medicare. It is time to level the playing field and force private plans to really compete with traditional Medicare.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1793597,"ids":1793597,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"If the world is going to reduce the quantity of greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere, every industry has to find ways to use energy more efficiently. One of the most common-sense proposals we have heard lately comes from Sir Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic airline.\n        As passengers on late-departing flights are only too aware, jets taxi between the gate and the runway sometimes for an hour or longer. And they do it with their giant engines burning fuel the entire time. Sir Richard proposes simply that an aircraft's engines remain off until the plane is ready for takeoff.\n        Under his proposal, tugs would pull the airplanes from the gates to a holding area near the end of the runway. This would reduce the pollution generated by the waiting planes. Not only does that help the effort against global warming, it also benefits the health of those living nearby.\n        Like any new system, there would be kinks to work out, such as how to power systems like air-conditioning or heating while the plane waited. The biggest hurdle of all may be bureaucratic, because of the many different companies and regulatory bodies represented at each location. But airlines should get behind the proposal because it would save fuel, which in the end would mean saving money.\n        Virgin says it is working with London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports to try to get trial programs up and running. We hope that Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark get involved as well. An official at the Port Authority said it would embrace the opportunity, and pointed out that the authority has applied for a grant to acquire electric-powered tow vehicles. With a little cooperation, substantial reductions in airport ground pollution are within reach.\n        When Sir Richard pledged last week to invest $3 billion over 10 years to fight global warming, some questioned whether it was one of his many publicity stunts. This new proposal should allay doubts about his commitment and seriousness. Ultimately, private enterprise must play a critical role in moving away from an economy powered by fossil fuels and toward a sustainable one run on alternative power sources. The more entrepreneurs like the brash Sir Richard get involved in green business, the faster we will end our reliance on petroleum.\n        But the actions of private citizens and businesses do not absolve the government of responsibility to act decisively. The United States government still needs to regulate emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.

Winner Jr., a Republican from Elmira, introduced a similarly strong bill for the Senate last week. Mr. Pataki's aides say the governor also plans to push an expansion of lobbying laws in a package of four ethics bills, as a follow-up to his State of the State address in January. One bill would ban lobbying for state contracts altogether. The governor is also planning to push for another bill, closer to the Assembly and Senate versions, that would require lobbyists working the state agencies to register with the lobbying commission.\n        The governor's complete ban on contract lobbying seems sound in principle.The question is whether it would work in the real world. Some legislators are concerned that an outright ban on lobbying could be thrown out by the courts, perhaps as an infringement on free speech. Other good-government advocates, concerned that lobbyists will find a way around such a ban, say that it would be better to know what they are up to by requiring them to register, as they do for the Legislature.\n        The differences between Mr. Pataki's proposals and the Legislature's are not major and could be easily worked out if all parties really wanted to do so. In Albany, that is too often a very large ''if.''","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1852738,"ids":1852738,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"If there is a point to gathering the leaders of eight of the world's richest and most powerful nations each year, it is to thrash out policies for tackling the most pressing and contentious problems.\n        Three such issues confront the presidents and prime ministers assembled in Heiligendamm, Germany, this week. They need to apply the brakes to climate change, live up to past pledges on Africa and halt Iran's rush to develop nuclear weapons technology. All three issues have been discussed endlessly at previous Group of 8 gatherings. The challenge now is to back up past declarations with effective action before another year slips away and the problems become even more acute.\n        President Bush has now finally moved beyond denial on climate change. But his proposal for a conference of 15 of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters can hardly be called global leadership. It pins its hopes on wishful technological breakthroughs and sidesteps mandatory ceilings.\n        A more serious proposal comes from this year's host, Chancellor Angela Merkel. She would impose mandatory caps and incentives to achieve a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by midcentury. That's far too specific for Mr. Bush, who is now pressing for watered-down language in the final communiqu\u00e9. Mrs. Merkel and like-minded leaders such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair need to hold their ground.\n        Two years ago, the eight countries pledged to double assistance to Africa by 2010 and liberalize trade opportunities. So far, they have made little significant progress toward those goals. Global trade negotiations are stalled and apart from one-shot debt relief for Nigeria, overall aid numbers have barely budged. Without year-by-year aid targets, the 2010 goal will not be met. This week, the leaders should make a further commitment to fund the widest possible access to AIDS treatment and care. Mr. Bush has shown leadership on AIDS funding. Others now need to step up as well.\n        The most urgent issue is Iran. President Ahmadinejad's latest warning against further sanctions is a blatant attempt to manipulate divisions among the eight. The warnings should be going in the other direction, with Iran being plainly told that further nuclear experimentation will lead to much tougher penalties.\n        Any hope of getting Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions will require a full-court sanctions press from the United States, the European Union and Russia. Russia isn't as rich as the other Group of 8 nations and is far less democratic. But its longstanding trade and technological relations with Iran give it special influence.\n        The United States has taken a firmer diplomatic line than Europe, which still nourishes illusions about Iran's willingness to respond to arguments alone. Europe needs to wake up to unpleasant realities and increase the pressure. A tough and unified trans-Atlantic stand could bring Russia along as well. To wait any longer on this issue is to court disaster.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1808081,"ids":1808081,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"If there is a thankless task in public life, it has to be making decisions about closing or restructuring institutions like military bases or hospitals. That makes the job done by New York's Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century particularly impressive. Charged with trying to reform and reorder one of the most expensive and inefficient health care systems in the country, it has come up with a bold and intelligent set of recommendations.\n        The commission calls for the closing of nine hospitals -- a modest number in a state with 60,000 hospital beds. It would restructure 48 other institutions through downsizing, mergers and other shifts intended to end duplication and offer a more complete range of health care for more people.\n        None of these far-reaching changes will be easy to get past Albany's lawmakers, who have until the end of the year to block the reform. But Stephen Berger, the chairman of the commission, was right yesterday when he said the state health care network was ''broken'' and that rescuing a failed system would be harder and more expensive than fixing it now.\n        Already the report has produced a raft of questions. What happens to women's health care if private and religious hospitals merge? How can displaced workers be retrained for other hospital jobs? Is privatization of some nursing homes or hospitals the right way to provide communitywide care?\n        Still, even this early in the assessment of the commission's complex package, it appears that members of Mr. Berger's group had the right instincts. They have emphasized the concerns of patients rather than the state's political favorites. They have tried to make basic health care facilities more available to give better and less costly care to those who now go to emergency rooms instead.\n        While the plan's architects expect it to save money over the long run, their focus was on making the system rational and effective, and the hospitals fiscally stable. It was a good decision, although Eliot Spitzer, the incoming governor, will have to look elsewhere to find real near-term savings in the state's $45 billion Medicaid budget.\n        But the commission report follows through on Mr. Spitzer's call for genuine reform rather than desultory patching of the status quo. If the recommendations can survive a Legislature known for its lack of imagination and political courage, they will provide an excellent way for him to start quickly addressing one of his top priorities: rebuilding a better health care system for all New Yorkers.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1810262,"ids":1810262,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"If there is any job that requires extraordinary integrity, it is that of the inspector or watchdog. The official who investigates others has to keep his own house cleaner than clean. Otherwise, any criticisms can too easily disappear in a hail of counter-criticisms and claims of hypocrisy. This is the problem that Alan Hevesi, New York State's comptroller, faces as his office audits everything from school boards to the state's racing board. When he bars a Medicaid provider because of overpayments or asks a school district to tighten its controls or details the weaknesses in oversight of gambling, the easy political response is, ''Who are you to point a finger?''\n        For over three years Mr. Hevesi was unlawfully allowing the state to pay in full for a car and driver for his ailing wife. He has apologized, repeatedly, and is now in the process of paying back the state for the misuse of taxpayer money. Despite all this, he was re-elected, and his supporters say he should thus be allowed to serve another term.\n        But an election cannot overcome the possibility that Mr. Hevesi violated state law, as charged by the State Ethics Commission. Moreover, as each new release of the details about Mrs. Hevesi's chauffeur and car has become available, it has become clear that Mr. Hevesi's behavior was at odds with the way a comptroller, or any other state official, should do business.\n        Take a recent comptroller's report criticizing the state Health Department for not reviewing files in a ''timely manner'' in order to discontinue Medicaid benefits for those who were disqualified, including 34 who were dead. The impact of the report was muted by Mr. Hevesi's own failure to pay back the state for the use of a driver in a timely manner.\n        Then there is the problem of records. If you read through the audits from any comptroller's office, many of the strongest criticisms concern the way records are kept. Record-keeping, in fact, is the meat and potatoes of public accountability. Yet, Mr. Hevesi ''failed to take a single step to ensure that proper records were maintained so that the proper reimbursement amounts could eventually be calculated,'' wrote David Kelley, the special counsel appointed by Gov. George Pataki for this case. At this point, there are three continuing investigations of Mr. Hevesi. The others are by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's office and by Albany County's district attorney, David Soares.\n        Those investigations will take time and drain resources, while it is already clear that Mr. Hevesi's record in this matter is not up to the standards of his job. His own words should remind him of what is at stake. When a former Oswego mayor was questioned about $3,500 in spending on dining and travel, Mr. Hevesi said, ''We take a zero-tolerance approach to local officials who abuse their position and use public money for their own benefit.''\n        That is exactly why Mr. Hevesi should resign instead of expecting to be sworn in for a new term. The Legislature and Mr. Spitzer, the incoming governor, should pick a replacement -- not a political crony but a person who can criticize others from a position of strength and rectitude.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1766214,"ids":1766214,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"If there was a contest for openness during this week's New York political conventions, the Republicans won hands down. The party, which usually prefers candidates presented to the voters in a tidy political package of one per office, authorized primaries for the state's top two races. As one Republican operative explained after the convention in Hempstead, Long Island: ''Primaries this year will probably be good for the party. Shake the cobwebs out.''\n        In many ways the Republicans can only gain by presenting real choices for governor and U.S. senator in September. Their candidates will almost certainly be long shots in the general election. After 12 years with Gov. George Pataki running the Republican Party in a deeply Democratic state, these primaries can give Republicans a chance to rethink who they really are.\n        To run against Attorney General Eliot Spitzer for governor, the convention decided to give voters a choice between William Weld, the former Massachusetts governor, who is a relative moderate in the Pataki mold, and John Faso, the former Assembly minority leader, who is a popular conservative. Similarly, to run against Hillary Clinton for the Senate, Republican leaders put both John Spencer, the former Yonkers mayor and a vigorous conservative, and K. T. McFarland, one of the top women in the Reagan administration, on the primary ballot.\n        The Democratic convention was very different, attempting to shut out all competition for Mr. Spitzer and Andrew Cuomo, the party's choice for attorney general. Thomas Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, who is Mr. Spitzer's only real Democratic competitor, got a cold shoulder. In the race for attorney general, the Democrats shut out four credible candidates to steamroller Mr. Cuomo onto their ticket.\n        Political parties think of primaries as trouble, like watching a lot of money spent on an ugly public divorce. But giving the voters choices is almost always the best option. That's true for the Republicans, who are now struggling to find an identity. But Mr. Spitzer could use a challenger who makes him clarify his own thinking about how to fix Albany, and there's absolutely no reason why Democratic voters who could choose among several attractive candidates for attorney general should wind up having one crammed down their throats.\n        Any of the Democratic hopefuls who want to buck the party choice will have to get on the ballot by getting registered voters to sign their petitions. That might not be too onerous in any state but New York, where court challenges to petition signatures are a way of political life. In the past, Democrats have been known to allow delegates to shift around so that every viable candidate had automatic entry to the primary ballot. Too bad they did not honor that tradition this week in Buffalo.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1672053,"ids":1672053,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"If there were any doubt about the wisdom of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's decision on how future emergencies should be managed in New York City, it was removed this week. The toxicity of the long-running turf wars between the Police and Fire Departments was on full view when Chief Peter Hayden, the top-ranking civil servant in the city's Fire Department, went before the City Council. Chief Hayden delivered a scathing attack on the mayor's policy, an attack that seemed to be grounded mainly in the Fire Department's anger over the Police Department's being given initial control of situations that might involve terrorists.\n        Fellow firefighters cheered as if Chief Hayden had done something heroic. In fact, he had simply demonstrated the kind of ridiculous interdepartmental rivalry the city can no longer afford. It may be time to consider merging the police and the firefighters into a single emergency services department under one commissioner.\n        Mr. Bloomberg's protocols assume that in most emergencies, the Fire and Police Departments can coordinate their actions. This seems reasonable, but when emotions are running high during a crisis, there are no guarantees that destructive rivalries won't bubble up. Even the mayor's plan provides no way to resolve a dispute over command during an emergency, short of having Mr. Bloomberg step in as the referee.\n        The Fire Department was particularly upset that the plan called for the police to take the lead in events involving hazardous materials. Many firefighters have trained for such work and have handled such jobs in the past. But what the mayor understands, and the Fire Department apparently does not, is that a chemical spill can no longer be assumed to be just that. The biggest fear facing New Yorkers is not a fire or even a hazardous materials spill, terrible as that might be. It is that a potentially deadly event could be but the first in a chain of terrorist attacks.\n        If there is to be a chance to prevent something like that, police work will be needed from the start. That does not mean, as has been insinuated by police detractors, that officers will stop firefighters from doing what they do best, saving lives.\n        If the Fire Department is dismayed by the duplication of effort the new plan may entail, there's a very clear answer. A merged fire-and-police service would ensure that everyone would stop playing tug of war, and concentrate on keeping the city safe.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1665460,"ids":1665460,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"If there were any need to explain the cloud of failure hanging over the Hempstead Union Free School District, a report last week from the State Education Department provided all the details.\n        The report, prepared by a team of about 40 specialists who visited last December, found deficiencies in every area examined, from curriculum to safety to buildings to food. The high school and middle school in particular suffer from a miserable range of problems beyond low achievement and high dropout rates, including a shortage of resources for English and math instruction, inadequate security, deteriorating buildings, demoralized staff members, gang activity, an ''open campus'' policy that encourages truancy and tardiness, and Afrocentric programs blind to the reality that Hempstead's students are now mostly Hispanic.\n        Other evidence was literally sickening: team members examining the lunch operation found sloppy kitchens, moldy refrigerators and a staff untrained in basic sanitation and hygiene. The food service staff, the report said, operated without cost controls or oversight and used inflated meal counts to gain more government money and donated food.\n        The full report is available at nytimes.com\/nyregionopinions. Anyone who cares about Long Island's children should read it.\n        What it depicts is not a worthy band of professionals suffering under the constraints of impossibly meager budgets -- a situation shared by many other poor, minority school districts across the state -- but an administration that has abdicated even the most basic duties of responsible, competent management. This should come as no surprise, given the board's embarrassing history of ineptitude and infighting, as exemplified in the last year by the firing, reinstatement and refiring of a superintendent in a deplorable clash with the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills.\n        What the state has now documented in Hempstead amounts to a fundamental betrayal of the public trust. The next few months will be crucial in determining once and for all whether the current board, under Superintendent Susan Johnson, has the ability or the will to improve things.\n        In last week's report, the Education Department recommended a monumental to-do list, from overhauling the curriculum to firing the food director. It is a daunting task, but vital to restoring hope for the school children of Hempstead, where residents are so distrustful of the school administration that in December 2003 they rejected a $177 million bond issue that would have done much to improve the schools' crumbling physical structures.\n        The next step for Hempstead -- a state takeover -- is a drastic measure rightly approached with great reluctance. But the issue deserves serious consideration in the next legislative session if, as we expect, the situation has not begun to turn around. In Hempstead, as in Roosevelt and other afflicted school districts, parents are deeply skeptical of handing things over to Albany. The issue is especially touchy in the balkanized racial climate of Long Island, where some have wondered why the criminally mismanaged (but mostly white) Roslyn schools, for example, were never a takeover target.\n        The reason is that Roslyn's students receive a sound, basic education, and Hempstead's do not.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1691840,"ids":1691840,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"If there's a positive side to President Bush's appointment of John Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations yesterday, it's that as long as Mr. Bolton is in New York, he will not be wreaking diplomatic havoc anywhere else. Talks with North Korea, for instance, have been looking more productive since Mr. Bolton left the State Department, and it's hard not to think that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's generally positive performance in office is due, in part, to her canniness in dispatching Mr. Bolton out of Washington.\n        But the appointment is, of course, terrible news for the United Nations, whose diplomats have heard weeks of Senate testimony about Mr. Bolton's lack of respect for their institution and his deeply undiplomatic, bullying style of doing business. Senator George Voinovich, the Ohio Republican who became one of Mr. Bolton's strongest critics, said yesterday that he planned to send the new ambassador a book on how to be an effective manager. It couldn't hurt, but this may be the first time a world superpower has used its top United Nations post as a spot for the remedial training of a troublesome government employee.\n        Mr. Bush had been unable to get Mr. Bolton's nomination confirmed by the Senate, so he waited until Congress left town and used his constitutional power to make recess appointments. This is a perfectly legal tactic, though one that has seldom been used to fill this kind of position. A recess appointment is particularly dicey for a major diplomatic post, where a good nominee should carry an aura of personal gravitas and legitimacy.\n        The problem here from the beginning has been that Mr. Bush clearly has little respect for either the United Nations or international diplomacy in general.\n        There is plenty to complain about at the United Nations, but real work happens there, and it requires the services of men and women who know how to wring agreement out of a group of wildly different and extremely self-interested representatives. The president has not just sent the United Nations what Senator Christopher Dodd accurately termed ''damaged goods.'' In Mr. Bolton, he has selected goods that weren't appropriate for the task even before the Senate began to hold hearings -- when Mr. Bolton's reputation was still in one piece.\n        The United Nations could certainly be improved, but Mr. Bolton is a poor candidate for a reformer. To make the institution better, the Bush administration would first have to show that it has a vision of what the U.N. could be. That vision has to begin by accepting the fact that nations other than the United States have a right to have a say, and sometimes take the lead.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1659029,"ids":1659029,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"If you are in a ''persistent vegetative state'' and there is a dispute about whether to keep you alive, your case will probably go no further than state court -- unless you are Terri Schiavo. President Bush signed legislation yesterday giving Ms. Schiavo's parents a personal right to sue in federal court. The new law tramples on the principle that this is ''a nation of laws, not of men,'' and it guts the power of the states. When the commotion over this one tragic woman is over, Congress and the president will have done real damage to the founders' careful plan for American democracy.\n        Ms. Schiavo's case presents heart-wrenching human issues, and difficult legal ones. But the Florida courts, after careful deliberation, ruled that she would not want to be kept alive by artificial means in her current state, and ordered her feeding tube removed. Ms. Schiavo's parents, who wanted the tube to remain, hoped to get the Florida Legislature to intervene, but it did not do so.\n        That should have settled the matter. But supporters of Ms. Schiavo's parents, particularly members of the religious right, leaned heavily on Congress and the White House to step in. They did so yesterday with the new law, which gives ''any parent of Theresa Marie Schiavo'' standing to sue in federal court to keep her alive.\n        This narrow focus is offensive. The founders believed in a nation in which, as Justice Robert Jackson once wrote, we would ''submit ourselves to rulers only if under rules.'' There is no place in such a system for a special law creating rights for only one family. The White House insists that the law will not be a precedent. But that means that the right to bring such claims in federal court is reserved for people with enough political pull to get a law passed that names them in the text.\n        The Bush administration and the current Congressional leadership like to wax eloquent about states' rights. But they dropped those principles in their rush to stampede over the Florida courts and Legislature. The new law doesn't miss a chance to trample on the state's autonomy and dignity. There are a variety of technical legal doctrines the federal courts use to show deference to state courts, like ''abstention'' and ''exhaustion of remedies.'' The new law decrees that in Ms. Schiavo's case, these well-established doctrines simply will not apply.\n        Republicans have traditionally championed respect for the delicate balance the founders created. But in the Schiavo case, and in the battle to stop the Democratic filibusters of judicial nominations, President Bush and his Congressional allies have begun to enunciate a new principle: the rules of government are worth respecting only if they produce the result we want. It may be a formula for short-term political success, but it is no way to preserve and protect a great republic.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1677325,"ids":1677325,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"If you could improve the lives of hundreds of millions of the world's most destitute people with a program that might -- just might -- temporarily reduce the profits of the global gold industry, most people would probably think it is worth doing. Even most members of Congress. That's why it has been so disturbing to see gold producers strong-arm Congress and the White House into blocking just such a desperately needed measure.\n        Poor countries need debt relief. Some African governments spend three times as much on debt service as they do on health care. They could be using the money to train nurses, eliminate school fees and fight AIDS. More debt relief is needed, and a deal needs to be sealed at the summit of the Group of 8 industrial countries in July.\n        A real solution has been postponed because the wealthy countries can't agree on how to finance it. But Britain offered a good answer: have the International Monetary Fund sell about $12 billion of its gold reserves, which have a total market value of about $43 billion. That would cover debt owed the fund, which accounts for 30 percent of the interest payments owed over the next 5 to 10 years by the affected countries. The fund could sell more gold to cancel debts owed the World Bank and other banks.\n        This is the simplest and least painful solution. It would not require new contributions or hurt lending to middle-income countries, and it is the only one that has any hope of support from rich countries. But the United States has veto power over gold decisions in the monetary fund, so this idea needs approval from Congress -- and the mining industry has blocked a vote. In January, a letter opposing the sale of I.M.F. gold was signed by 12 senators from Western states, including the Democratic leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. The letter argued that the sale could drive down the price of gold. A similar letter was signed in March by 30 members of the House.\n        Because few lawmakers spend much time thinking about the I.M.F., the letters --sparked by lobbyists from the National Mining Association and gold mining companies -- persuaded the leadership that the gold proposal would not pass, even before it came up for discussion. The Bush administration, apparently unwilling to take on a Congressional fight, began in April to oppose gold sales outright.\n        The gold industry is worried about a pricing hit that probably would never happen. In March, the monetary fund concluded that gold prices would not be affected, as it could sell the gold over several years while at the same time asking central banks to sell less. Gold-producing poor countries endorse I.M.F. gold sales. The president of the World Gold Council said recently that he would give them conditional support. Congress needs to debate the issue, not allow a special interest to deny help to hundreds of millions of poor people.

Anybody with the slightest understanding of why New York's Legislature ranks among the worst in the country knows that these kinds of details really count.\n        In the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled Assembly, those in power want to continue their stranglehold on the legislative process.

Many New York legislators whine that they will miss committee hearings and quality time with constituents if they actually have to vote in person. But the floor is where the real action should be.

As it is now, about one-fourth of the bills passed by New York's Legislature are rushed to the floor under the governor's emergency powers. This means legislators spend a lot of time voting on bills they have no chance even to read. These ''messages of necessity,'' as they are called, should be allowed only with a vote of two-thirds of the members of each chamber.\n        Both houses need to make it easier to have conference committees to iron out differences between bills. It should also be easier for legislators of both parties to put their names on bills they want to sponsor and to get those bills to the floor for votes.\n        This is the one time the Legislature can easily loosen its undemocratic guidelines, which now give all power to Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver, and make New York's Legislature a working body where every voter in every district has some voice through the elected representatives.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1773359,"ids":1773359,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"If you want to start an argument, mention breast-feeding. A two-year federally sponsored campaign caused a rumpus when it compared a mother who fails to breast-feed with a pregnant woman who rides a bucking mechanical bull at a local tavern, or, in one official's formulation, with a woman who smokes while carrying a child. Recently, a Times article on the campaign incited a new debate that kept the report in the paper's most-e-mailed list for days. While we hesitate to stir things up again, it seems as if this is one issue where the middle ground makes the most sense.\n        The government is right to let out the word that, all things being equal, mothers should breast-feed their babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics cites ''strong evidence'' that breast milk reduces the incidence and severity of a wide range of infectious diseases, including diarrhea, respiratory infections and ear infections.\n        That's information new parents should have. But some women still find breast-feeding is far more difficult and painful than expected and decide that the stress is bad for their relationship with the new baby. Others find it difficult to pump breast milk while at work. Society should encourage employers to provide secure, private places where women can pump their milk and store it for later use. But it should not be in the business of hounding those who decide they do not want to go there.\n        Babies who are not breast-fed lose a health advantage, at least over the short term. But the decision on whether to breast-feed is one of dozens that parents make -- such as whether their children will be reared in city or country and whether, when they become adolescents, they will be allowed to drive. The government's job is to discourage parents from making choices that affect other children -- like a refusal to be inoculated for serious diseases -- and to enforce laws that protect youngsters from clear and present dangers, like unbuckled car seat belts.\n        The equation might change if it became clear that breast-feeding could protect babies from serious illnesses later in life. The American Academy of Pediatrics concluded last year that ''some studies'' suggest adults and older children who were breast-fed are less apt to contract diabetes, lymphoma, leukemia, obesity, high cholesterol and asthma.

Most people would agree on a few things. It would be green and pretty. It would be safe but stimulating, offering better diversions than bingo, TV and staring into space. Residents could relax and reminisce, but also study and learn. There would be arts and music, lectures and books, movies and shows. And there would be lots of young people around.\n        You could spend a ton of money and effort designing such a place. Or you could just put it on a college campus.\n        Thomas J. Schwarz, president of SUNY College at Purchase, wants to do just that. He has been trying to persuade the state to approve the lease of 54 campus acres for a ''senior learning community'' similar to those that have been built on or near colleges and universities around the country.\n        Mr. Schwarz and the Westchester lawmakers sponsoring the proposal in Albany -- Nicholas Spano in the Senate and Adam Bradley in the Assembly -- see it as a way to accomplish many good things at once. The county gets much-needed housing for people 65 and older, who are 14 percent of its population. SUNY Purchase, a relatively isolated suburban beacon for theater, dance, film, music and visual arts, gets an appreciative in-house population of theatergoers, docents, research participants, mentors, tutors, volunteers and just neighbors and friends.\n        The college also makes some money from the project and maybe fattens its endowment later, after a few rich old folks have had their hearts gladdened and purse strings loosened by a few last golden years of campus living.\n        The Spano-Bradley proposal is smart and solid, but only the Senate has passed it. There are concerns in the Assembly about possible contract abuses and the precedent of leasing SUNY land to developers, but those can be dealt with. Mr. Bradley's bill calls for strict review of the project by the state attorney general, comptroller and budget office. And while retirement townhouses are probably not a good idea for SUNY's campuses upstate, they make perfect sense for Westchester, where the supply of open land is tight. They would surely be better than what's there now: a mound of debris from an abandoned construction project.\n        College retirement communities are an innovation that is not exactly new. Whether in Lawrence, Kan., or Ann Arbor, Mich., lawmakers, educators and retirees have known for years that adding older people to the mix in a college town can lead to a creative collision between youth and experience, an alliance of energy and wisdom, that benefits everyone. Notre Dame, the University of Michigan, Penn State and Stanford are only a few of the schools that have contributed to the trend.\n        This good idea should have a chance to take root in Westchester, too, and maybe other parts of New York. Learning is a lifelong process. SUNY's mission is to educate all New Yorkers. Old ain't dead. The generations should mix it up. Youth is wasted on the young, but it doesn't have to be. The Assembly should approve Mr. Bradley's bill.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1647700,"ids":1647700,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Imagine, if you dare, the short, wretched life of the suburban plant in a world without Miracle-Gro.\n        Stuck in a barren patch of backyard by a black-thumbed homeowner, unmulched, underfed, bullied by local weeds, brutalized by insects, disfigured by disease, stooped and eventually unable to support itself, much less its own wizened fruits or flowers, it waits, yellow and spindly, for a killing frost and the peaceful silence of wintry death.\n        Be glad, for that is not the world we live in. Our zucchinis and bell peppers and hostas thrive, and we along with them, because Horace Hagedorn lived.\n        Mr. Hagedorn, who died at his home in Sands Point on Monday at 89, was the man behind Miracle-Gro. He was the adman and huckster (his son's affectionate term) who took someone else's water-soluble fertilizer and marketed it into consumer-product immortality. Miracle-Gro has become one of those name-brand powders, like Morton's, Arm &amp; Hammer and Calgon, without which modern life would be inconceivable.\n        Because of Mr. Hagedorn, we live in a greener, brighter place, where tomatoes ripen to bursting in their cages, where mums and tulips gleam with health and vibrant color, and where success in horticulture is within reach of anybody with a watering can and a supply of magic powder from a green and yellow box.\n        Like most fairy-tale potions, Mr. Hagedorn's brilliant blue liquid is a mixed blessing.

After Miracle-Gro made him rich, he did not retreat behind hedgerows with his fortune.

He was a major donor to Hofstra University's school of education and Adelphi University's business school.\n        Perhaps his best-known philanthropic project was to seed the futures of 50 poor schoolchildren in Brooklyn by promising to pay for their college educations.

If you water something and add fertilizer, it will grow even better.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1701533,"ids":1701533,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"In 1966, the Supreme Court held that the poll tax was unconstitutional. Nearly 40 years later, Georgia is still charging people to vote, this time with a new voter ID law that requires many people without driver's licenses -- a group that is disproportionately poor, black and elderly -- to pay $20 or more for a state ID card. Georgia went ahead with this even though there is not a single place in the entire city of Atlanta where the cards are sold. The law is a national disgrace.\n        Until recently, Georgia, like most states, accepted many forms of identification at the polls. But starting this month, it is accepting only government-issued photo ID's. People with driver's licenses are fine. But many people without them have to buy a state ID card to vote, at a cost of $20 for a five-year card or $35 for 10 years. The cards are sold in 58 locations, in a state with 159 counties. It is outrageous that Atlanta does not have a single location. (The state says it plans to open one soon.) But the burden is also great on people in rural parts of the state.\n        The Republicans who pushed the law through, and Gov. Sonny Perdue, also a Republican, who signed it, say that it is intended to prevent fraud. But it seems clear that it is about keeping certain people away from the polls, for political advantage. The vast majority of fraud complaints in Georgia, according to its secretary of state, Cathy Cox, involve absentee ballots, which are unaffected by the new law. Ms. Cox says she is unaware of a single documented case in recent years of fraud through impersonation of a voter at the polls.\n        Citizens who swear they are indigent are exempt from the fee. But since the law does not define who is indigent, many people may be reluctant to swear and risk a criminal penalty. More important, the 24th Amendment, which outlawed poll taxes in federal elections, and the Supreme Court's decision striking down state poll taxes applied to all Americans, not just to the indigent. A Georgian who votes only in presidential elections, and buys a five-year card to do so, would be paying $10 per election. That is no doubt more than many people on fixed incomes, who struggle to get by but are not legally indigent, are willing to pay to vote.\n        If Georgia's law remains in place, other states are likely to follow. There is also growing concern among voting-rights advocates that a self-appointed election reform commission, led by James Baker, the former secretary of state who played a troubling role in the disputed 2000 election, and former President Jimmy Carter, may be about to propose national voter ID standards that would similarly make it harder for poor people and blacks to vote.\n        The American Civil Liberties Union is planning to challenge Georgia's law. It will have several strong legal claims, starting with the 24th Amendment. The Supreme Court said in 1966, in striking down the poll tax, that ''the right to vote is too precious, too fundamental to be so burdened.'' It still is.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":18,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1822577,"ids":1822577,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In 1975, after the oil embargo, Congress approved the most successful energy-saving measure this country has ever seen: the Corporate Average Fuel Economy system, known as CAFE, which set minimum mileage standards for cars. Within 10 years, automobile efficiency had virtually doubled, to 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985 from just over 14 miles per gallon in 1976.\n        The mileage standards are still 27.5 m.p.g. Except for minor tweaks, Congress has refused to raise fuel efficiency requirements or close a gaping loophole that lets S.U.V.'s and pickups be measured by a more lenient standard.\n        Americans who heard President Bush's State of the Union address, including his pledge to reduce America's gasoline consumption, can be forgiven for thinking he was finally ready to change that. But all Mr. Bush really asked for was the authority to set mileage standards in a different way. Rather than requiring companies to meet an average fuel-efficiency standard, balancing gas savers against gas guzzlers, he would assign targets model by model, based on factors like size and weight.\n        As for what those new targets might be, Mr. Bush would leave it to his secretary of transportation to decide. And he asked the country to take it on faith that this new measurement system, combined with technological advances, would lead to annual mileage improvements of 4 percent a year.\n        Our fear is that this program will take far too long to get going, if it gets going at all. Like Congress, the Transportation Department has been notoriously solicitous of the automobile industry.\n        But there's a way Congress can get moving. Senator Barack Obama plans to reintroduce a bill that would set a 4 percent annual increase in efficiency as a target, just what Mr. Bush says he wants. The bill would also give both the Transportation Department and the manufacturers considerable flexibility. But the department could not deviate from the target unless it could demonstrate that the costs outweighed the benefits.\n        Even that is too much wiggle room for lawmakers like Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Edward Markey. While allowing for administrative flexibility, they would require a firm fleetwide standard of 35 m.p.g. with no escape hatches. But given the long Congressional stalemate, the Obama bill could be an important first step. It commands some bipartisan support, and unlike Mr. Bush's approach, it promises real as opposed to hypothetical results.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1842082,"ids":1842082,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In 1978 most people bought bottled water only before a big storm, in case the electricity went out. That was the year the General Assembly decided to tack a nickel deposit onto containers of carbonated beverages like soda and beer. The law's purpose was to reduce litter, and it accomplished that.\n        But times change. The amount of bottled water sold has doubled in the last three years. It has gone from 206 million in 2002 to 426 million in 2005, according to the Connecticut Recycling Institute. The institute predicts more than 1 billion bottles of water will be sold here in 2010.\n        That incredible statistic is the best argument for expanding the bottle bill to include deposits on bottles of water and other noncarbonated beverages such as tea and fruit drinks.\n        This year's bill has a good chance of passing, despite opposition from grocers and similar groups who say it will increase the costs they incur when collecting the bottles. To help offset those costs, the proposal would increase handling fees for such groups to 3 cents a bottle from the current 1.5 cents.\n        But the bill has one persistent and maddening flaw. It continues the patently outrageous practice of allowing the bottling industry to keep the unclaimed bottle deposits, which amount to an estimated $25 million a year. The industry claims the money is needed to offset costs. But there has never been an independent audit of those costs, nor has there been an audit to figure out exactly how much of the people's unclaimed deposits roll in every year, only to be turned over to the bottlers.\n        The original version of this year's bill tried to use unclaimed deposits collected on noncarbonated beverages for recycling programs, a wise move since Connecticut's recycling rate has been stuck at 30 percent for years and desperately needs to improve. But the water industry objected, arguing that not getting unclaimed deposits would put them at a competitive disadvantage against those companies that get to keep the nickels.\n        Yet turning over all the deposits to big companies is a disservice to the state's citizens. Nonetheless, some legislators say that a bottle bill will never pass unless the unfair status quo continues.\n        The legislature should be embarrassed. It has never managed to face down lobbyists and bottling interests to take back the money. Previous leaders of the General Assembly would not even allow a recorded vote on the issue.\n        And the industry is shortsighted. It would be better off voluntarily giving up a percentage of the unclaimed deposits now rather than risk even a bigger cut in the future.\n        Despite this flaw, however, the bill deserves passage. And when it does pass, it must include a requirement that the amount of money collected in unclaimed deposits be counted and the information made public every year. People have a right to know how much of their money legislators are turning over to big companies instead of using it to clean up the environment -- the very point of the proposal.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1756402,"ids":1756402,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In 1992, a blue-ribbon task force made up of patient advocates, representatives from diverse religious communities and leaders in the fields of medicine and bioethics urged the New York State Legislature to approve a measure that would allow family members to act as surrogate decision makers for incapacitated patients unable to direct their own health care.\n        All these years later, sad to say, this badly needed measure -- the Family Health Care Decisions Act -- still remains on the legislative to-do list, a prime example of hurtful procrastination by Albany lawmakers.

That sensible directive lay on a back burner until 9\/11. The Department of Homeland Security then hastened to set up the U.S. Visit program, which requires people to be photographed and fingerprinted at ports of entry for checking against databases of terrorists and other undesirables.\n        That system has been running since 2004, and has plucked hundreds of bad people from the huge visitor stream without horribly disrupting tourism and business travel. But news came last week that the other half of the program -- monitoring foreign travelers when they leave -- has been abandoned.\n        The Homeland Security Department had hoped to begin tracking departures at the 50 busiest land border crossings by next December. But it has given up meeting that deadline after deciding that the cost -- including time lost in long lines at the borders -- would be prohibitive. Part of the problem is technological: tracking methods that would work are too expensive.\n        The Government Accountability Office, echoing the Bush administration's conclusions, said that a cost-effective departure system may not emerge for five to 10 years. And so, after spending $1.7 billion since 2003 on the U.S. Visit program, the administration will keep doing what it has been doing at the nation's land exits, which is basically nothing.\n        It's good to know who's leaving the country -- and who isn't. About a third of illegal immigrants are believed to be those who entered lawfully but stayed after their visas expired. Some of the 9\/11 hijackers were in this group. Hunting such people down is not even theoretically possible until you know whom you are looking for.\n        There are a few lessons in this downbeat development. One is simply a reminder that faith in technology is easily misplaced. Border security is a paradoxical mission -- maximizing the steady, efficient flow of tourists, students and seasonal workers while admitting exactly zero terrorists and visa-defying illegal immigrants. All this while respecting everyone's privacy and not spending too much money. There may be a technological fix that will solve all these problems cheaply, but we could grow old and poor waiting for it.\n        Another is that the same people who make lofty arguments for things like sealed borders tend to disappear when the discussion gets down to the nitty-gritty of trade-offs and acceptable costs. Washington has tons of people who want to keep out terrorists and illegal immigrants, but far fewer who want to commit the time and money to a realistic discussion of how to do that. The Bush administration says that keeping Americans safe at home is the overriding mission of our time. But it has allowed distractions to get in the way, like invading Iraq, cutting taxes for rich people and minimizing disruptions to everyday life for everyone not in the military. This administration keeps reminding us of the high price we all must pay for homeland security, but it always blanches when the bills arrive.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1640630,"ids":1640630,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"In 1998, with great expectations and after years of citizen lobbying, the New York State Legislature gave formal approval to one of the most important civic projects in 100 years -- the creation of the Hudson River Park. As envisioned by its planners, the park would replace five miles of industrial hulks, parking lots and rotting piers on Manhattan's Far West Side with an inviting mix of open space (some of it on brand-new piers), gardens, pedestrian walkways and tasteful commercial development. It would run from 59th Street to Battery Park City and, when finished, would give New Yorkers ready access to one of the world's great rivers.\n        One section of the park, adjacent to Greenwich Village, has been completed. It is a magnificent realization, with gardens and lawns and three new park piers for fishing, strolling and sunbathing that could well redefine, nationwide, what waterfront parks can be.\n        But there is trouble in parkland, and as usual it involves money. Including the Greenwich Village section, only half of the park has been built or assured -- some sections between 42nd Street and 59th Street are nearing completion and some financing is in place for a stretch in Chelsea. But the original $200 million pledged by the city and state is nearly exhausted. Unless new money is provided expeditiously, valuable momentum will be lost and large stretches of riverfront will remain in their decayed state for years.\n        There are two obvious sources of new financing. The City Council has approved $31 million that the Hudson River Park Trust, the agency in charge of design and construction, plans to spend on the Chelsea section. But Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said that he will not release the money until the state matches it -- a reasonable enough position, since this has always been a 50-50 deal. Surely Gov. George Pataki -- who publicly recommitted himself to the project in a speech last November -- can find $31 million, or a chunk of it, in a budget that is likely to exceed $100 billion.\n        The other source is the roughly $850 million that remains of the federal funds made available for the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan in the wake of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Two years ago, the park trust applied to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation for $70 million of that money to build a mile-long section of the park south from Houston Street to Battery Park City at the tip of the island.\n        That would be an entirely appropriate use of the money because the proposed parklands are adjacent to the neighborhoods most affected by 9\/11 and would provide downtown residents with open space at a time when they will be buffeted by new construction on all sides.\n        On this score, Mr. Pataki has been strongly supportive, although he has not specifically committed himself to the $70 million. Mr. Bloomberg has been coy. His aides keep saying privately that the Trust will get the money, but the Mayor has been silent. For its part, the corporation supports the concept and John C. Whitehead, its chairman, is an enthusiast. But the corporation is also being lobbied by other claimants and will not act without the joint consent of the governor and the mayor.\n        This worthy and remarkably cost-effective project deserves their unambiguous support and the modest financing it needs to see it through.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1848363,"ids":1848363,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In March 2004, the acting attorney general distrusted Alberto Gonzales so much that he wouldn't meet with him at the White House without a witness.

The president is still standing by his man, ignoring Mr. Gonzales's efforts to mislead Congress, his disregard for the Constitution and his gross neglect of even basic bureaucratic duties.\n        It's a familiar pattern: Mr. Bush sticks by his most trusted aides no matter how evident it is -- even to the Republican Congressional chorus -- that they are guilty of incompetence, bad judgment, malfeasance or all three. (George Tenet, the director of central intelligence; Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld; and the Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers spring to mind.)\n        Each time, we're told Mr. Bush repays loyalty with loyalty. We're told it's a sign of character.\n        We don't buy the explanation. The more persuasive answer is that Mr. Bush protects his embattled advisers because they are doing precisely what he told them to do.\n        Mr. Tenet was not off freelancing on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. He delivered what the White House wanted: claims that sounded dire enough to herd Americans into war. (His recent self-serving insistence that he admires the president but was shocked at the lack of thought and planning behind the war comes too late.) Mr. Tenet put the party line and his own career above the good of the country, and for that, he was rewarded with a Medal of Freedom.\n        Mr. Rumsfeld wasn't conducting a rogue operation when he planned the war in Iraq. He gave the president his victory on the cheap, which could be presented to Americans as sacrifice-free. When the plan literally exploded in the faces of an undermanned, poorly armored and badly led American force, Mr. Rumsfeld did Mr. Bush's bidding by denying failure after failure. The president stuck by him until the 2006 campaign ended in the one condition that trumps loyalty in the Bush family playbook: losing an election.\n        The president also clung to his nomination of Ms. Miers to the Supreme Court long after there was a bipartisan consensus that she was unqualified. Now we know that there is powerful evidence that Ms. Miers helped to orchestrate the political purge of United States attorneys.\n        The more of these White House psychodramas we get to witness, the more obvious it is that Mr. Bush's warm embrace is really a payoff to yes-men who didn't challenge his orders or question ideology-driven policies. It is a cynical way to run the United States government.

His remarks were interpreted at the time as a warning, perhaps even a harbinger of more oversight.\n        What a difference a month makes.\n        In what was billed as a major economic address last week, Mr. Paulson devoted less than one-tenth of his speech to hedge funds, leaving the impression that he is basically satisfied with the regulatory status quo.\n        No one wants the Treasury secretary to be an alarmist. But other officials, notably at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Securities and Exchange Commission, have gone further than merely acknowledging ''potential risks'' and pledging more ''deliberations,'' as Mr. Paulson did in his speech. Without pushing any panic buttons, they have broached the need for more collateral and better risk controls at banks that deal with hedge funds and greater oversight of hedge funds that solicit investments from pension plans.\n        Currently, some 9,000 hedge funds manage $1.3 trillion of investors' money and control trillions of dollars more through their use of loans and derivative financial tools. They invest in all major sectors and operate through banks and securities firms, affecting the economy as a whole. And yet, they remain largely beyond the reach of federal overseers, a holdover from the days when they were much less ubiquitous. In 1990, only a handful of hedge funds existed, and altogether they managed just $39 billion.\n        Opponents of regulation routinely note that hedge funds are indirectly supervised because the banks they do business with are regulated. According to that logic, banks guard against excesses by their hedge fund clients to protect themselves from losses and regulatory problems. That reasoning also assumes that bankers are free of conflicts that might impair their judgment. But as hedge funds have grown, banks have earned increasingly larger commissions, fees and trading profits from them, a development that could induce some bankers to err on the side of recklessness.\n        There's also an issue of practicality. As hedge funds become more numerous and complex, it is simply not feasible for banks to stay on top of their activities. And then there's the matter of responsibility. It's not a banker's job to protect the public interest. It's the job of regulators.\n        Mr. Paulson was right when he noted in his speech that the need for regulation must be balanced against the benefits of flexibility. But the challenge of striking a balance is beginning to sound like an excuse for delay. It's time to move the discussion beyond whether hedge funds require more regulation to how they should be regulated.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1853693,"ids":1853693,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In a Brooklyn courtroom last week, two men who were once among the borough's seediest power brokers learned how long they will now have to spend in prison. Former Assemblyman Clarence Norman, once the Democratic Party kingpin for the county, can expect two to five years behind bars, maybe more. Mr. Norman was convicted of extortion, soliciting illegal contributions and stealing from his re-election committee.\n        His fellow malefactor -- former State Supreme Court Justice Gerald Garson -- can expect to face three to ten years behind bars for accepting bribes and for official misconduct.\n        This difficult news for Mr. Norman and Mr. Garson should be a relief for Broolyn's citizens. Jail time, one hopes, will chasten anyone who thinks tainted politics and skewed judicial decisions can remain hidden from the authorities. As Charles Hynes, the district attorney in these cases, crowed afterwards, ''Those who seek to make corrupt deals are constantly looking over their shoulder.''\n        Still, there is an underlying issue in these cases that is far from being resolved. That is the scandalous way New York allows political parties -- in Brooklyn's case the Democrats -- to choose cronies as judges. In many ways, the genesis of these two cases was when Mr. Hynes and his office began investigating whether Brooklyn judgeships were being sold to the highest bidder. The district attorney has yet to prove that Mr. Norman orchestrated such injudicious behavior or that Mr. Garson profited from it, but this investigation helped highlight the slimy way Supreme Court judges have been chosen in the state for almost 80 years. Under that system, party leaders like Mr. Norman could pick their favorites; helpless voters would rubber-stamp them.\n        Last September, a federal court ordered the legislature to change the rules for these sham judiciary elections. But any reform is now on hold until the U.S. Supreme Court decides how to proceed. Until then, candidates in some counties will be screened by independent expert panels. That could help a bit. But while the panels will vet candidates the party leaders will still make the final choices.\n        Eventually the court or the legislature will conclude that it simply isn't right to pack the courts with cronies, even vetted ones. These should not be patronage jobs, nor should judges be chosen in open primaries if they have to depend on private funds. That money talks in the lawmaking field is bad enough. That wealthy special interests exercise influence over the courts is simply unacceptable.\n        The most workable and fair way to choose judges to date has been a merit selection system, not the one that caused so much trouble for so long in Brooklyn.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1845502,"ids":1845502,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"In a case of particularly bad timing, Gov.

New Yorkers take pride in their egalitarian green spaces, which are open to everyone. But acreage has always been at a premium, and public money cannot keep pace with the costs of upkeep and improvements. Over the years, the city has thus come to depend on private donations to fill the gaps.\n        Public-private partnerships can reap great benefits, as long as private interests don't overtake the public's right of access. The city will have to work hard not to tip that balance the wrong way on Randall's Island, a 480-acre public park that sits in the waters separating East Harlem, the South Bronx and Astoria, Queens.\n        Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe want to enter into a contract that would allow students at 20 of Manhattan's wealthiest private schools exclusive use of most of the island's playing fields during prime after-school hours for the next 20 years. In return, the city would get a real prize: upgraded and repaired fields which those schools have already been using for soccer, softball and other sports for 15 years, along with dozens of new fields, all financed by the private schools. Their total investment could be more than $80 million.\n        The schools had originally wanted a 30-year contract and exclusive rights to 80 percent of the fields during prime time. They've scaled that back to 20 years and two-thirds of the fields, leaving public schools and community groups with access to one-third of the space after school hours. The city should claim a larger share of prime time for public schools -- perhaps 40 percent to start, with a possible increase to 50 percent if demand materializes.\n        There are also objections in principle. New Yorkers for Parks, an independent monitor, warns the deal could set a dangerous precedent, in effect selling off public parkland to the wealthy and giving a new twist to the words ''pay to play.''\n        There's another very important point here, lost in the back-and-forth over contractual details. For people without private transportation -- and that means public school children -- Randall's Island is reachable only by a footbridge or the Triborough Bridge, with ferry service added for special events, like concerts. The Randall's Island Sports Foundation transports children from disadvantaged neighborhoods on the weekend. But public bus service is virtually nonexistent.\n        This explains why private schools have so far had the place mostly to themselves on weekdays. City Comptroller Bill Thompson and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer insist that as part of any new contract the city should guarantee better public transportation. It's an excellent idea.\n        The contract is to be voted on soon by the Franchise and Concession Review Committee, a little-known panel with six votes -- four controlled by the mayor. This is the committee that approved the contract for Snapple soft drinks in public schools as well as the contract with a private company to build a 26-acre water park on Randall's Island, drawing an objection from Mr. Stringer over a projected $40 ticket price.\n        Mayor Bloomberg, who has often shown impatience with government process, wants to change the committee rules to expedite its work. But in making decisions about the use of Randall's Island and other public spaces, the city needs more deliberation and transparency, not less.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1658825,"ids":1658825,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In a fit of energy uncommon for New York's Legislature, lawmakers are racing to finish next year's budget by midnight March 31. If they approve an on-time budget for the first time in 21 years, Albany's lawmakers deserve a vigorous round of applause. But the deadline is hardly the only thing that matters for a $105 billion state spending plan. The kudos won't last long if the budget hobbles social service financing for local governments, or fails to tackle critical and unavoidable issues like money for the public schools and the precarious state of mass transit in New York City.\n        In its rush to get done, the Legislature appears to have given short shrift to most of those concerns and focused on restoring Gov. George Pataki's cuts to Medicaid. That's too bad, because Medicaid is one issue on which the governor's general instincts seem right.\n        The health care program now makes up almost 44 percent of the budget, and while the bulk of the money pays for critical services for the poor, near-poor and elderly, there are areas where the state should be looking for economies. That will inevitably mean closing down underutilized hospitals and keeping more elderly New Yorkers at home, with some assistance, instead of in nursing homes. A list of preferred drugs allowed under the program could also bring big savings.\n        Mr. Pataki has already persuaded Washington to make an extra $1.5 billion in Medicaid funds available if New York starts doing some cutting and restructuring. But the powerful health care workers' union and lobbyists for the health care industry have been pressing vigorously against any quick action. It's not a criticism of the health care workers to say we wish the lawmakers themselves had half the skill in communicating their priorities.\n        The idea of a commission, similar to the one used by the Pentagon to identify underutilized military bases for closing, is a good idea. But it can work only if it is a truly independent group, not the tool of the special interests with the richest and most energetic lobbyists. And any commission must work quickly. It cannot be an excuse for dragging out the inevitable.\n        Some Democrats in Albany have been grumbling that the pressure for on-time budgets and open decision-making is hurting their ability to protect important programs. That's because the Democrats, who control only the Assembly, have gotten much of what they wanted in the past by retreating behind closed doors and refusing to negotiate until concessions were made. We've generally liked their goals. But we also think elected officials should come out in the open and share their concerns with the public. Little by little, Albany is inching in that direction.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1790758,"ids":1790758,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In a lamentable decision this summer, New York's highest court declared that denying same-sex couples the right to marry does not violate the state's constitutional requirement of due process and equal protection. But wrong-headed as it was, the 4-to-2 ruling by the Court of Appeals was not so broad as to alter the state's duty to respect same-sex marriages validly performed in other jurisdictions like Massachusetts or Canada, where such unions are allowed.\n        That vital distinction needs clarification. Just days after the ruling, a lower court on Long Island, citing the Court of Appeals decision, blocked the efforts of a 73-year-old man, Duke Funderburke, to obtain spousal health benefits for Bradley Davis, his partner of 43 years. The two men were married in Ontario in 2004.\n        Last week, the judge denied a motion for a rehearing, thereby tossing the controversy to the state Appellate Division.\n        In a cursory three-page order, Justice Edward McCarthy said that the Court of Appeals' ruling upholding New York's ban on same-sex marriages within the state made it impossible for him to recognize the union between Mr. Funderburke and Mr. Davis as lawful.\n        Yet the question of honoring same-sex marriages performed out-of-state is an entirely separate issue from not honoring in-state same-sex marriages. Eliot Spitzer, the state Attorney General and current gubernatorial candidate who defended New York's ban on same-sex marriage in the Court of Appeals, made exactly this point in a detailed advisory opinion issued in 2004 in response to inquiries from local elected officials.\n        He found that same-sex marriages are covered by the state's longstanding ''marriage recognition rule'' -- a common law rule under which marriages validly contracted out-of-state must be accorded respect in New York, and the parties to such unions treated as spouses, regardless of whether the union would be allowed in New York. Justice McCarthy was wrong to read the marriage recognition rule as excluding legitimately married gay couples.\n        Mr. Spitzer noted further that New York is one of a handful of states that has not passed a law explicitly declaring that same-sex marriage violates the state's public policy or that such marriages performed elsewhere will not be recognized. Meanwhile, and without much fanfare, New York City, Nyack, Rochester, Buffalo, and a host of other public and private employers around the state have begun to extend marital benefits to same-sex couples who tie the knot legally outside of New York.\n        The misguided Funderburke decision should be overturned on appeal. Otherwise we will be left with a judge's mistake, the effect of which is to deny the the humanity of gay people and the consequence of which will be to destabilize their families. The child of a same-sex couple should not have to worry whether his or her parents' will be considered legally wed, or the benefits and protections that go with marriage will be terminated, when the family moves from Massachusetts to New York.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1725082,"ids":1725082,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"In a legislative season that has produced few victories for the environment, the sudden death of a destructive mining provision that could have opened up millions of acres of public land to commercial exploitation is cause for celebration.\n        The provision was inserted into the budget reconciliation bill -- always a handy hiding place for ideas that could never stand up to public scrutiny on their own -- by Representatives Jim Gibbons of Nevada and Richard Pombo of California, both Republicans. Mr. Gibbons's decision to withdraw it reflected not so much a change of heart as a recognition of political reality. Their stealth proposal had inspired intense opposition among hunters, anglers, governors, local officials and countless ordinary citizens who argued that there were many nobler uses for the public lands than serving as a profit center for commercial interests.\n        The Gibbons-Pombo provision would have allowed the holders of mining claims to buy land outright instead of leasing it -- a radical departure from present practice. It would also have amended the General Mining Law of 1872 to allow purchases not just for mining, but for any purpose that would ''facilitate sustainable economic development.'' By some calculations, that dangerously vague formulation would have exposed at least 6 million acres and perhaps as much as 350 million acres to commercial exploitation. Even conservative Western lawmakers who do not usually favor environmental causes saw this for what it was: a potentially unparalleled raid on America's public lands.\n        The controversy stirred by the Gibbons-Pombo maneuver has been so great that there is even reason to hope that proposals for real reform of the antiquated mining law will at last receive a respectable hearing.\n        Representatives Nick Rahall II and Jay Inslee, both Democrats, and Christopher Shays, a Republican, have put forward a bill to give permanent protection to lands that are now vulnerable to claims, like wildlife refuges and roadless areas of the national forests. The bill would require ''suitability'' reviews before mining could proceed, and would allow the secretary of the interior to withdraw lands judged unsuitable for mining. It would also require mining companies to pay royalties on what they produced -- just as oil and gas companies do now -- and to clean up their messes when they were through.\n        Many of these reforms were instituted administratively by Bruce Babbitt when he was secretary of the interior under President Bill Clinton, but were withdrawn by the Bush administration at the insistence of mining interests.\n        It would be a delightful reversal of fortune if Mr. Gibbons and Mr. Pombo, who are no friends of the public lands, ended up inspiring new protections for them.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1837301,"ids":1837301,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"In a matter of weeks, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is expected to issue his report on what New York needs to do to sustain itself as a desirable destination for residents, businesses and visitors. The report, called PlaNYC 2030, is intended to be an important guidepost for the city's future. Done right, it could become a global model and an important piece of Mr. Bloomberg's legacy.\n        To get there, though, the mayor will have to deal aggressively with a vexing problem, traffic congestion. If that piece of the plan falls short, the rest of Mr. Bloomberg's vision won't much matter. In just a couple of decades, New York is expected to add nearly a million more people. To have any hope of keeping people moving, the city will need to take real and substantial action to unclog its roads -- including some form of congestion fee and other disincentives to driving on the busiest streets.\n        Besides helping business and boosting the general quality of life, congestion relief would also produce cleaner air, to the enormous benefit of public health, a fact that has so far mostly been missed in the debate over congestion pricing. But a newly released report from Environmental Defense, a nonpartisan group, is likely to give these issues more prominence.\n        The report shows that vehicle emissions -- especially dangerous diesel soot -- can pollute the air as far as 1,500 feet from the source. In New York City, that means it's hard to escape them, which is troubling in a city with high asthma rates. And not just asthma but lung problems, as well as heart disease, have been linked to vehicle emissions, which are also thought to contribute to strokes and some kinds of cancers.\n        That is all worth considering as Mr. Bloomberg's team tries to balance good policy with what is politically achievable. City Hall has been cautious so far on congestion pricing; the idea has influential proponents, including the city's leading business organization, the Partnership for New York City. But the opposition, including owners of city parking garages, has been vocal as it tries to misrepresent the fee as a tax that targets the little guy.\n        For the sake of the city, we hope the voices of reason prevail. Nothing has been as effective as congestion pricing for getting more people out of their cars and on to public transportation, bikes, scooters or their own feet. Fee systems have worked well in London, where daily car trips have been reduced by about 500,000; the fees, meanwhile, have paid for public transportation upgrades, an approach that New York could adapt to expand subway, bus and even ferry service. In Stockholm, residents have now embraced the idea after a trial run dispelled earlier doubts.\n        Mr. Bloomberg has been a leading voice on the need to reduce emissions in response to the threat of climate change. He has also made a good start in replacing city vehicles with cleaner-burning models. But making meaningful reductions in emissions will require dramatic reductions in the number of cars, buses and trucks that jam the city's streets. And one way to bring that about is to remind people of what gridlock does to our health.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1774424,"ids":1774424,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In a move that has caused both delight and apprehension among those who worry about global warming, the Supreme Court has agreed to rule next fall on whether the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The case is among the most important environmental disputes ever to come before the court.\n        The outcome will have much to say about whether the country will be able to act more aggressively on a problem with potentially grave consequences for the earth and its inhabitants. It could also determine whether states that have acted on their own to limit global warming emissions from vehicles -- as California and 10 other states have done -- can proceed without fear of a federal veto.\n        President Bush has advanced many reasons for not pressing for strong controls on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants and other industrial sources. But his ace in the hole has been the claim that the federal government has no authority to regulate greenhouse gases.\n        The case turns largely on a simple reading of the Clean Air Act. The administration argues that the act mentions carbon dioxide only in passing, and that if Congress had been truly worried about global warming it would have given the gases that cause it more emphasis and instructed the E.P.A. to take aggressive steps to control them, as it did with sulfur dioxide and other pollutants. The administration argues further that the science on global warming is too ''uncertain'' to justify anything more than a voluntary effort to deal with it.\n        The plaintiffs -- a formidable collection of state governments and environmental groups -- argue that the plain language of the Clean Air Act gives the government jurisdiction over ''any air pollutant'' that threatens ''public health or welfare'' and, further, that ''welfare'' specifically includes effects on climate and weather. This interpretation of the act was first set forth by President Clinton's E.P.A. and stood as agency policy until Mr. Bush reversed it (without consulting his own E.P.A.) in 2001.\n        As for the science that the administration finds so shaky, the plaintiffs will argue that the science has grown steadily more persuasive since the Clean Air Act was last revised in 1990; that the administration has cherry-picked arguments about details while ignoring the vast preponderance of the evidence; and that the consensus among mainstream scientists -- a consensus reinforced by a recent National Academy of Sciences report -- is that the earth is inexorably heating up and that industrial emissions are largely responsible.\n        This is a case of global importance, not least because America's failure to act decisively has discouraged the rest of the world from acting decisively. On the face of it, the law plainly gives the government the power to regulate greenhouse gases. A ruling that tells the administration that it has that power does not mean that it will actually use it. But it will no longer be able to hide behind a legal fiction.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":5,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1643013,"ids":1643013,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"In a round of pre-inauguration interviews, President Bush has repeatedly said he's serious about immigration reform. When it comes to fixing a ''broken'' immigration system, the president keeps sending messages that he is not giving up, despite the noise coming from the send-'em-home crowd in his own party. Over at the House of Representatives, this steadfast support of a more humane immigration system has made some anti-immigration folks very unhappy. They have accused him of being ''petulant,'' of jeopardizing his whole agenda by pushing this difficult issue. As Representative J.D. Hayworth, a Republican from Arizona, told The Washington Times last week, ''It would just be sad for the president to tie his shoelaces together right out of the starting block.''\n        With friends like these at his back, Mr. Bush deserves more public support from the Republicans who can be more thoughtful on this issue, like Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the new chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on immigration. Democrats should also start to rally behind the White House on this issue, especially if people like Senator Edward Kennedy can participate in the crafting of such an important reform that could make the system fairer, safer and more humane.\n        The president has repeatedly said in recent months that he does not want an amnesty or ''instant citizenship'' for the 8 million to 10 million undocumented aliens who live and work in America. Instead, Mr. Bush has been talking in general about a guest-worker program that would be designed to give legal status to those now doing jobs Americans refuse to do. But the president also increasingly seems to be acknowledging the key to such a program, which is that these workers must be offered a path to American citizenship. Certainly, they cannot be allowed to jump the very long queue that already exists. But what undocumented workers would come out of the shadows willingly if it meant an automatic one-way ticket back to their native land?\n        Mr. Bush also seems to have found a good way recently to talk to those who see any illegal immigrant as a security risk. He told The Wall Street Journal that he believes a better guest-worker program will immediately improve border security. If it is unnecessary for thousands of workers to cross the nation's borders secretly, the ones who do try to sneak across ''may be involved in something other than labor,'' as the president explained. If the Bush immigration system can be more humane, fair and even secure, the president deserves support, especially from his conservative friends.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1653437,"ids":1653437,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In a shocking abuse of office, the attorney general of Kansas is conducting a stealth campaign to violate the privacy of about 90 women who obtained late-term abortions, offering the flimsy claim that he's looking for evidence of crime.\n        Protected by a sweeping gag order from a local judge, Attorney General Phill Kline has been demanding the women's records from two clinics that have been unable to even warn clients that their intimate histories are being sought. When the inquiry finally came to light through a court brief, Mr. Kline maintained that he needed all the women's records -- including their identities, sexual histories, clinical profiles and birth control methods -- to prosecute statutory rape and other suspected sexual crimes.\n        Kansans deserve a full explanation of this gross intrusion into medical confidences that are supposed to be carefully protected by law. But Mr. Kline, a fervid anti-abortion campaigner throughout his career as a Republican politician, would not answer reporters' questions about his investigation. ''Clinics should not act to protect the secrecy of the predator,'' he insisted in a statement, offering a blanket smear in lieu of a proper explanation.\n        Mr. Kline's campaign echoes a similar salvo last year by Attorney General John Ashcroft. Federal judges eventually cited privacy laws to stop his attempt to forage through hundreds of records at a half-dozen hospitals. Two years ago, Mr. Kline called on health-care providers to report underage sexual activity, but a federal judge ruled him out of line. Mr. Kline deserves another rebuff, beginning with the suspension of the gag order.\n        The targeted clinics say they have observed state requirements to report possible crimes. They have filed an appeal to the State Supreme Court, complaining that Mr. Kline is conducting a fishing expedition, not a case-specific inquiry. The clinics have suggested a compromise -- that the identities of the women be blacked out with the option for more information from any whose records might yield evidence of crimes like statutory rape.\n        It's not at all clear how that crime is linked in particular to late-term abortions, which just happen to be the current target of Republican anti-abortion activists across the country. Late-term abortions -- beyond 22 weeks of gestation -- are illegal in Kansas, except when they are done to protect a woman's health. But Mr. Kline offers no evidence to suggest he has any legal ground to justify pawing through the confidential records of the 90 women he has targeted for his mission of harassment. As for predatory abuse of girls under the age of sexual consent, they could have obtained abortions earlier than 22 weeks.\n        There is no disputing that Mr. Kline has the duty and power to uphold the law. No one wishes child abusers to walk free. But Mr. Kline also has privacy laws to uphold. His demand for the clinics' records is not only insupportable legally; it smacks of an ideological dragnet.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1833514,"ids":1833514,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"In a speech just before his recent Asia trip, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. cited a poll showing that only a third of Americans view free trade as an economic plus, while nearly half say it is bad for jobs and wages. Unless Mr. Paulson and the administration do a lot more to counter that public anxiety -- and growing opposition on Capitol Hill -- President Bush stands to lose his fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals, which will be up for renewal soon, and will find it increasingly hard to block protectionist laws.\n        So far Mr. Paulson has tried to explain away Americans' fears by stressing that technology, not trade, is most to blame for lost jobs. But the opposition is not only about lost jobs. It's also about the downward pressure on wages and the concentration of income at the top that have gone hand in hand with globalization. And it's about the erosion of the social safety net -- from inadequate unemployment compensation to subpar public schools -- which makes many Americans view economic transitions like globalization as risks not worth taking.\n        As the nation's top economic official, Mr. Paulson should be the person to push for policies to strengthen the political foundation for free trade. That would start with a significant upgrading of the Labor Department's Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which helps workers who lose jobs because of trade. Congress expanded the program in 2002 in exchange for granting Mr. Bush fast-track negotiating authority on trade deals. But the administration has made little effort to publicize the program, and many eligible workers do not even know it exists.\n        Also long overdue is a plan to guarantee all Americans health care. Education is also important, although Mr. Paulson is overstating the case when he describes it as a silver bullet for making Americans more competitive. Unfortunately, the administration has let the funds decline for proven programs like Head Start and has even failed to secure full financing for its No Child Left Behind initiative.\n        In the wake of Mr. Paulson's trip to China, Beijing made another comment about liberalizing its currency exchange rate, a move that would help make American exports more competitive. But the greatest threats to free trade are Americans' fears about globalization and their doubts that the government will do anything to help them. It's time for Mr. Paulson to use his powers of persuasion -- starting with Mr. Bush -- to solve the domestic side of the trade problem.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1832113,"ids":1832113,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"In a startling development that also makes us uneasy, the United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear next term an appeal of recent lower court decisions invalidating New York's clubhouse-controlled judicial election system. As a result, the legal pressure to come up with a replacement for the discredited election process by the end of the current legislative session has been lifted, greatly diminishing the chances that Albany will act.\n        The silver lining, if there is one, is that Gov. Eliot Spitzer and state lawmakers can now devote more time and attention to these other pressing court reform issues:\n        Judicial pay. New York State judges have gone without a pay raise since 1999, putting their compensation level near the bottom rung nationally, and way behind that of the underpaid federal judiciary. In addition to the catch-up increases Mr. Spitzer has included in his proposed budget, lawmakers should heed Chief Judge Judith Kaye's call for a new manner of setting judicial compensation, with the goal of severing the link between judicial and legislative pay that gave rise to the current problem.\n        Court restructuring. Mr. Spitzer announced in his State of the State message that enacting Judge Kaye's sensible plan for consolidating New York's byzantine maze of different trial courts into a simple two-tiered structure is one of his priorities. The change requires amending the state Constitution, a process that calls for approval by two separate Legislatures, and then by voters. All the more reason for Mr. Spitzer to start nudging lawmakers to get things rolling.\n        Village courts. Judge Kaye's call for $10 million to improve oversight of the state's long-neglected network of local town and village courts while a blue-ribbon commission weighs more far-reaching changes, such as requiring that all local justices be lawyers, deserves support. So does the request by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct for a modest $2.2 million budget increase to address a growing caseload, including complaints against ill-trained village justices.\n        Matrimonial and family law. Judge Kaye's creation of a new family law center in New York City will help make divorce faster and cheaper for some couples who want an amicable settlement. But as she well recognizes, it is no substitute for having New York finally join the rest of the country in enacting a no-fault divorce provision to curtail the lying and finger-pointing that make negotiations a lot uglier, costlier and longer than they have to be.\n        To address the surge in child abuse and neglect reports, meanwhile, the Legislature urgently needs to authorize 39 new family court judgeships.\n        This list is far from exhaustive. Judge Kaye's new idea of putting the state's broken probation system under judicial branch supervision holds promise on both administrative and public safety grounds. The task of creating a coherent, statewide system for indigent defense out of the current hodgepodge of underfinanced defenders has been put off for too long.\n        Last week, the Republican-led State Senate voted to approve Governor Spitzer's decision to extend Judge Kaye's tenure as the state's top judge to the end of 2008, when she will reach the mandatory retirement age of 70. We like to think the senators were not only acknowledging the judge's fine record as a jurist, but also signaling real interest in working with Mr. Spitzer and the Democratic Assembly to bring her worthy court reform ideas to fruition.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1829697,"ids":1829697,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"In a way, the stock market's rebound yesterday was as troubling as Tuesday's rout.\n        Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, managed to calm the market, saying that one could reasonably hope for a stronger economy by midyear if  housing stabilized soon, and if manufacturing strengthened. But those are big ifs.\n        The torrent of bad news on housing is only worsening, with a report yesterday that new home sales for January had their steepest slide in 13 years. And as David Leonhardt pointed out in yesterday's Times, manufacturing has already slipped into a recession, with activity contracting in two of the last three months. How is it then that investors took Mr. Bernanke's words as a ''buy'' signal?\n        The short answer is that investors have a proclivity to hear what they want to hear. On Tuesday, warning bells were simply too loud to ignore, including the steep sell-off in stocks in Shanghai, downbeat reports on the United States economy and an attempt in Afghanistan on the life of Vice President Dick Cheney. Yesterday, investors needed only the slightest prod to revert to ''hear no evil'' form.\n        The more complete answer is also more troubling. In recent years, as housing and stock markets surged, even highly speculative investors have been encouraged to an unusual degree by their bankers and regulators, who are supposed to restrain investors' more maniacal bents, but instead have done little to quell or question excessive risk-taking.\n        Just last week, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. and top financial regulators said the government need not -- and should not -- provide greater oversight for the $1.4 trillion hedge fund industry, or, by extension, the trillions of dollars more in complex derivative transactions spawned by the industry. That stance is mostly free-market ideology run amok. But it is also based on the unproven assumption that unregulated investing, which dispersed risk and reduced volatility as markets surged, will continue to do so when markets tank.\n        The upshot is a one-sided bet for investors. They have explicit assurances from regulators and policy makers that almost anything goes when the markets are hot, and implicit assurances -- based on past experience -- that the Fed would lower interest rates to contain a financial crisis should one erupt. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that easing up on rates would have the same powerful effect in a future crisis as it had in the past.\n        The next crisis appears to be building around weakness in the United States, not in Russia or Asia or South America. That means money could flow out of the country if markets were rattled. That would weaken the dollar and require speedy and complex remedial action by the world's central banks -- not just a rate cut by the Fed. Tuesday's stock market decline could turn out to have been a garden-variety correction. But major market participants would be wise to rethink their assumptions.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1652835,"ids":1652835,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In a welcome ruling for this newspaper, and the larger cause of robust journalism and government accountability, a federal judge in New York has barred a federal prosecutor's ill-conceived effort to get the phone records of two Times reporters from the fall of 2001 in order to discover the identity of their confidential sources. To justify this intrusive fishing expedition, which could reveal hundreds of communications with confidential sources, the prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, the United States attorney in Chicago, had argued that the records were needed for a grand jury's investigation of government misconduct in the disclosure of impending government actions against two Islamic charities.\n        The judge, Robert Sweet, reasoned, correctly, that the subpoenas for the phone records were the functional equivalent of demanding testimony from the reporters themselves, and he took note of the important role of confidential sources in news investigations of the Watergate, Iran-contra, Monica Lewinsky and Abu Ghraib scandals. He explained that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York recognized a qualified First Amendment privilege that protects reporters from being compelled to disclose their confidential sources. And he said Mr. Fitzgerald had not shown that the information he sought was critical and could not be gotten elsewhere. ''The reporters at issue relied upon the promise of confidentiality to gather information concerning issues of paramount national importance,'' Judge Sweet wrote, referring to Judith Miller and Philip Shenon of The Times. ''The government has failed to demonstrate that the balance of competing interests weighs in its favor.''\n        Judge Sweet's finding of broad protections for reporters facing grand jury subpoenas stands as a refreshing contrast with last week's chilling decision by a three-judge appellate panel in Washington. That panel found no such protection for members of the press in another case involving Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Miller: a grand jury's investigation into the disclosure of the identity of an undercover C.I.A. officer, Valerie Plame. The Washington appeals court ruling raised the prospect that Ms. Miller and Matthew Cooper, of Time magazine, could be jailed for up to 18 months for refusing to testify before that grand jury. That situation cries out for a rehearing by the full appellate bench and, ultimately, Supreme Court review, especially in light of the contrary New York ruling.\n        Meanwhile, an even more basic issue has been raised in recent articles in The Washington Post and elsewhere: the real possibility that the disclosure of Ms. Plame's identity, while an abuse of power, may not have violated any law. Before any reporters are jailed, searching court review is needed to determine whether the facts indeed support a criminal prosecution under existing provisions of the law protecting the identities of covert operatives. Some judge may have looked at the issue, but we have no way of knowing, given the bizarre level of secrecy that still prevents the reporters being threatened with jail from seeing the nine-page blanked-out portion of last week's decision evaluating the evidence.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1684005,"ids":1684005,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"In almost every respect, the new design for the so-called Freedom Tower, which was presented to the public yesterday, is better than the one it replaces. Above all, it will be safer, less vulnerable to terrorist attacks from the ground, thereby easing the New York Police Department's basic concerns about security, which sent the architect David Childs back to the drawing board only a few weeks ago. This building -- like the preceding design -- will also set rigorous new standards for protecting its occupants and guaranteeing a safe exit in case of disaster.\n        Because of the insistence of Gov. George Pataki and Daniel Libeskind, the master planner of the site, the design still incorporates a meaningless numerical coincidence -- an overall height of 1,776 feet at the top of the antenna. Far more important is the fact that this new design will make it easy for us all to remember the scale of the World Trade Center. The altitude of the observation deck will be 1,362 feet, with a parapet that rises six feet higher. Those were the heights of the twin towers.\n        So much for the good news. The bad news is that the original design was in a state of deconstruction even before the Police Department voiced its security worries. Many of the features that would have made that building environmentally and architecturally distinctive had been stripped away at the insistence of Larry Silverstein, the developer who held the lease on the World Trade Center and who has received several billion dollars in insurance proceeds following its destruction.\n        Plans are all well and good. But the basic question raised by this new design is the same one raised earlier. What will Mr. Silverstein actually build?\n        New Yorkers had reason to watch the public presentation of this new design yesterday with some skepticism. We have seen so many designs, so many models. We know now, unhappily, that the final plans, whatever they are, will likely be hammered out in private.\n        But this was at least a public reckoning of sorts, an opportunity to see, for a moment, inside the working relationship between Mr. Childs and his client, Mr. Silverstein. Ordinarily, the private evolution of building plans between a developer and his architect would be nothing unusual. But this is not ordinary. Mr. Silverstein holds the insurance money he won in court in trust for the public. He is building on public ground, with public oversight from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. While there is no question that even this new design for the Freedom Tower will evolve over time, this project can never be seen as a normal private business deal.\n        Every question about the commercial redevelopment of ground zero comes back to a question about the instincts of one man, Larry Silverstein. He has claimed that he has the city's interests at heart -- he eagerly acknowledges the moral obligation that 9\/11 placed upon him. But his own pocketbook speaks every bit as loudly. Every politician, including the governor, dances around him. His cost cutting is as much the architect of the tower that will eventually be built as Mr. Childs is. The new design for the Freedom Tower is impressive. What matters, though, is not what we make of it, but what Mr. Silverstein will.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1695400,"ids":1695400,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"In an age whose crabbed sense of justice finds expression in dismal phrases like ''zero tolerance'' and ''three strikes and you're out,'' the events in a Long Island courtroom on Monday came as an undeserved gift, something startling and luminous.\n        It happened when Ryan Cushing, a 19-year-old charged with assault for tossing a turkey through a car windshield last fall, approached the driver he nearly killed, Victoria Ruvolo. Ms. Ruvolo, 44, suffered severe injuries and needed many hours of surgery to rebuild her shattered facial bones.\n        When Mr. Cushing left the courtroom after pleading guilty, he came face to face with his victim for the first time. He said he was sorry and begged her to forgive him.\n        She did. She cradled his head as he sobbed. She stroked his face and patted his back. ''It's O.K.; it's O.K.,'' she said. ''I just want you to make your life the best it can be.''\n        Mr. Cushing was one of six teenagers out for a night of joy riding and crime, which often happens when childish aggression and stupidity merge with the ability to drive and steal credit cards. The five others have pleaded guilty to various acts like forgery and larceny, but Mr. Cushing, who threw the turkey, could have faced 25 years in prison. At Ms. Ruvolo's insistence, prosecutors granted him a plea bargain instead: six months in jail and five years' probation.\n        The prosecutor, Thomas Spota, had been ready to seek harsh punishment for a crime he rightly denounced as heedless and brutal. ''This is not an act of mere stupidity,'' Mr. Spota said. ''They're not 9- or 7-year-old children.''\n        That is true. But Ms. Ruvolo's resolute compassion, coming seemingly out of nowhere, disarmed Mr. Spota and led to a far more satisfying result.\n        Many have assumed that Ms. Ruvolo's motivation is religious. But while we can estimate the size of her heart, we can't peer into it. Her impulse may have been entirely secular.\n        Court testimony by crime victims is often pitched as a sort of retributive therapy, a way for angry, injured people to force criminals to confront their shame. But while some convicts grovel, others smirk. Many are impassive. It's hard to imagine that those hurt by crime reliably find healing in the courtroom. Given the opportunity for retribution, Ms. Ruvolo gave and got something better: the dissipation of anger and the restoration of hope, in a gesture as cleansing as the tears washing down her damaged face, and the face of the foolish, miserable boy whose life she single-handedly restored.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1683508,"ids":1683508,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In another landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Grokster, a company that facilitates illegal exchanges of copyrighted music over the Internet. The justices got the issue exactly right, holding that actively encouraging copyright infringement is illegal, but merely creating new technology that makes it possible is not. The Grokster decision sets out a sensible framework for intellectual property law in the Internet age.\n        ''Peer to peer'' networks like Grokster connect far-flung computers, making it easy to exchange music, movies and other content. The networks like to call these exchanges ''sharing.'' But the vast majority of the music is copyrighted and exchanged without permission. That makes the sharing more like theft, and on a sweeping scale. Billions of files are exchanged over Grokster and Gnutella, another major peer-to-peer network, every month. The networks like to present themselves as innocent middlemen. But they actively encourage illegal exchanges. Grokster, for example, sent its users a newsletter promoting the availability of copyrighted materials. And they profit from the illegal exchanges. The networks make money by selling ads that are shown while their services are used.\n        The legal battles over copyright and technology have gotten highly esoteric lately. But yesterday's decision -- based on a suit by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios and other copyright holders -- brought things back to a basic legal principle. If a company actively encourages people to violate the law, in this case the copyright law, it can be held liable for the results of its actions. If Grokster and the other networks encourage intellectual property theft, they can expect to be sued.\n        Grokster's supporters warned before yesterday's ruling that if the peer-to-peer networks lost, it would stifle new technology. But the court emphasized that developing a technology that could be used to infringe on copyright is not enough to make the developer legally responsible. The decision limits liability to companies and individuals who induce others to break the law through ''purposeful, culpable expression and conduct.'' It ''does nothing,'' the court underscored, ''to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.''\n        In their zeal to protect technology innovators, Grokster's supporters have shown too little regard for other kinds of creative people. Musician, moviemakers and writers rely on sales revenue to support their art and to pay their bills. File sharing's most aggressive advocates like to say that on the Internet, information ''wants to be free.'' But in the real world, creators of intellectual property want, and need, to be paid.

The ruling relied on a shameful law that President Bush stampeded through Congress last fall that gives dangerously short shrift to the Constitution.\n        The right of prisoners to challenge their confinement -- habeas corpus -- is enshrined in the Constitution and is central to American liberty. Congress and the Supreme Court should act quickly and forcefully to undo the grievous damage that last fall's law -- and this week's ruling -- have done to this basic freedom.\n        The Supreme Court ruled last year on the jerry-built system of military tribunals that the Bush administration established to try the Guant\u00e1namo detainees, finding it illegal. Mr. Bush responded by driving through Congress the Military Commissions Act, which presumed to deny the right of habeas corpus to any noncitizen designated as an ''enemy combatant.'' This frightening law raises insurmountable obstacles for prisoners to challenge their detentions. And it gives the government the power to take away habeas rights from any noncitizen living in the United States who is unfortunate enough to be labeled an enemy combatant.\n        The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which rejected the detainees' claims by a vote of 2 to 1, should have permitted the detainees to be heard in court -- and it should have ruled that the law is unconstitutional.\n        As Judge Judith Rogers argued in a strong dissent, the Supreme Court has already rejected the argument that detainees do not have habeas rights because Guant\u00e1namo is located outside the United States. Judge Rogers also rightly noted that the Constitution limits the circumstances under which Congress can suspend habeas to ''cases of Rebellion or invasion,'' which is hardly the situation today. Moreover, she said, the act's alternative provisions for review of cases are constitutionally inadequate. The Supreme Court should add this case to its docket right away and reverse it before this term ends.\n        Congress should not wait for the Supreme Court to act. With the Democrats now in charge, it is in a good position to pass a new law that fixes the dangerous mess it has made. Senators Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, have introduced a bill that would repeal the provision in the Military Commissions Act that purports to obliterate the habeas corpus rights of detainees.\n        The Bush administration's assault on civil liberties does not end with habeas corpus. Congress should also move quickly to pass another crucial bill, introduced by Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. That measure, among other steps, would once and for all outlaw the use of evidence obtained through torture.\n        When the Founding Fathers put habeas corpus in Article I of the Constitution, they were underscoring the vital importance to a democracy of allowing prisoners to challenge their confinement in a court of law.

This ecological truism could also apply to Long Island's treacherous housing landscape, where nearly all homes are owner-occupied and rental apartments are scarce. Nonprofit groups and government agencies seeking housing for the poor and vulnerable are often forced to deal with unsavory, negligent landlords, particularly when the need for an apartment -- any apartment -- is urgent and the alternative in some cases is a Dumpster or the woods.\n        The challenge is to make the worst slumlords fix their properties while not appreciably shrinking the supply of housing for the poor. Two efforts in Suffolk County are aimed at resolving that dilemma. One makes sense; the other does not.\n        Let's start with the nonstarter, a bill by Legislator Joseph T. Caracappa that would require landlords who rent to tenants referred from the county's Department of Social Services to file affidavits twice a year affirming that their properties are fully up to code. Mr. Caracappa says that forcing landlords to attest to their own rectitude -- and to pay a $1,000 fine if they don't -- puts teeth into existing housing regulations and is a reasonable way to protect the vulnerable.\n        Advocates for Long Island's poor, who know a thing or two about protecting the vulnerable, are irate. They say the bill, which is co-sponsored by four other Republicans and by Legislator Brian X. Foley, a Democrat who should know better, will induce landlords to lie about their properties or simply to drop their Social Services tenants. In a market as overheated as Long Island's, the advocates argue, no meager housing voucher from Suffolk County will be worth the red tape and paper trail exposing a landlord to nitpicking legal action. To think that the bad landlords who are the targets of this bill will eagerly embrace a third option -- to spruce up their apartments and file truthful affidavits in a timely fashion -- seems highly doubtful.\n        At a hearing in the Suffolk Legislature this week, Mr. Caracappa was truculent and sarcastic in response to the housing lawyers, single mothers and advocates for the poor who pleaded with him to adjust or abandon his approach. His surliness suggested that his grasp of the issue was unencumbered by subtlety or compassion, and that his commitment to solving the problem of unsafe housing was as thin as his parliamentary skin.\n        Those who work with people in Long Island's poorest areas say it is no secret who the worst landlords are and where the worst properties are. That is why we are encouraged by an effort to enlist the Suffolk County police to help the Department of Social Services conduct surprise inspections of notorious properties. The pilot program, which Steve Levy, the county executive, said would be tried first in the Towns of Brookhaven and Babylon, would also involve withholding rent from landlords who refuse to fix problems.\n        As long as efforts are made to protect tenants, who may be legally liable in disputes involving nonpayment of rent, this approach promises to make real improvements in people's lives. It is focused and grounded in the real world, which is more than can be said of Mr. Caracappa's blunderbuss effort to subdue slumlords with paperwork.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1836189,"ids":1836189,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"In cities and suburbs across America, the confluence of homes, big-box stores and striving immigrant men has created an informal, often unruly job marketplace that has survived every effort to ban it or harass it out of existence.\n        This market, of Latino day laborers, is hardly the only manifestation of the shadow immigrant economy, but it is the hardest to ignore. These are the immigrants whom localities seem the most desperate to subdue, usually with laws against loitering and job solicitation. A Los Angeles suburb, Baldwin Park, is the latest of dozens to tackle the problem, with an antisoliciting bill written broadly enough to cover cookie-selling Girl Scouts but really meant for the Latino men at Home Depot.\n        Such crackdowns are constitutionally dubious and usually fail, and some lawmakers are having doubts about them. Last week, on Long Island, the Suffolk County Legislature defeated a bill to drive away day laborers by forbidding them to ''obstruct'' county roads. The majority understood that the dimly reasoned measure would have simply diverted workers and contractors' trucks onto other roads while inviting civil-rights lawsuits. It would not have reduced the population of day laborers the least bit.\n        It was a good outcome for a bad bill, but the county is still stuck where it has been for years -- wondering how to handle a volatile mixture of men and trucks in a suburb that wishes they would go away. A good next step for Suffolk would be to come around to a solution that other communities have tried, with generally positive results: a hiring site.\n        One can oppose illegal immigration and still approve of hiring sites, places where laborers can find shade, toilets and a safe place to negotiate jobs with contractors and homeowners. The most obvious reasons are crowd control and traffic safety.\n        But an equally compelling reason is that hiring sites impose order on free-market chaos. An unregulated day-labor bazaar wallows in the mud flats of capitalism, benefiting sleazy contractors and fostering rock-bottom wages and working conditions for all laborers, legal or not. Hiring sites that register and monitor contractors and laborers can hold them all to account. Employers who undercut competitors and rob workers will find it hard to return to a well-established hiring site, and drunks and belligerents among the laborers will be pressured to toe the line. These places are sometimes called ''shape-up sites,'' an apt term in more ways than one.\n        Some lawmakers have gotten over the notion that hiring sites are gifts to illegals, and have concluded that approaching day laborers as community members, with rights and civic responsibilities, is smarter than ranting about them as pests. It is heartening that some local officials are willing to confront the realities of a flawed immigration system and to work responsibly to lessen its troublesome side effects.\n        Then there are those who hold out hope that with just one more crackdown, one more ticketing blitz, the men who make our suburbs gleam will take their sweat and muscle elsewhere and leave us alone to tend our homes and hedges by ourselves. Government officials on Long Island, as elsewhere, have tried stiff-necked hostility to day laborers, and have reaped years of failure. They should consider hiring sites as the next, positive step -- one that promises not only to be practical and humane, but also effective.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1785854,"ids":1785854,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In coming weeks, the Internal Revenue Service plans to start siccing private debt collectors on people with up to $25,000 in unpaid income taxes -- and laying off nearly half of the auditors who examine estate tax returns of the wealthiest taxpayers.\n        Concern for appearances should, on its own, impel the agency to scuttle its plans. A perception of unfairness is bad for the tax system, and this pair of policies virtually screams ''only little people pay taxes.'' But appearances are not the only reason to rethink these initiatives.\n        Private tax collection costs more than it would cost to give the I.R.S. the resources to pursue the debts. Federal budgeting oddities only make it seem less costly. Private collection also raises serious concerns about fraud and privacy. Mark Everson, the I.R.S. commissioner, should fight hard for the resources the agency needs to do the job it clearly does best. Instead, he supports private collection, allowing the administration and Congress to indulge the fiction that they are saving money.\n        The rationale for laying off estate tax auditors is also unconvincing. To allay suspicions the cutbacks are a way to shield wealthy heirs from taxes, two Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, John Lewis of Georgia and Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota, sent a letter recently to Mr. Everson, asking for facts and figures to justify the job cuts.\n        Mr. Everson responded with a ''trust me'' letter. He said that the I.R.S. could enforce the law with a smaller staff because the number of estate tax returns was expected to decline. The filing threshold for estates is set to rise from $2 million today to $3.5 million in 2009, resulting in fewer filings for relatively small estates. However, the figures he provided indicate the cutbacks will reduce audit coverage, in part because significant estate auditing resources are already focused on large fortunes that will be taxable even after the law is fully in effect.\n        Mr. Everson also said it would be better to do more auditing of big-dollar income tax returns. But he did not supply the data that Congress and the public need to vet that assertion. What is required is the number of hours auditors spend on various types of audits and the additional tax they collect for their efforts. If Mr. Everson cares about public confidence in his decisions and in the tax system itself, he should provide the information without delay.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1836707,"ids":1836707,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In his Senate testimony yesterday, Kyle Sampson, the former chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, tried to be a ''loyal Bushie,'' a term Mr. Sampson used in his infamous e-mail message to describe what he was looking for in United States attorneys. But if Mr. Sampson was trying to fall on his sword, he had horrible aim. In testimony that got so embarrassing for the White House that the Republicans tried to cut it off, Mr. Sampson simply ended up making it clearer than ever that the eight prosecutors were fired for political reasons.\n        He provided more evidence, also, that the attorney general and other top Justice Department officials were dishonest in their initial statements about the firings.\n        Mr. Sampson flatly contradicted the attorney general's claim that he did not participate in the selection of the prosecutors to be fired and never had a conversation about ''where things stood.'' Mr. Sampson testified that Mr. Gonzales was ''aware of this process from the beginning,'' and that the two men regularly discussed where things stood. Mr. Sampson also confirmed that Mr. Gonzales was at the Nov. 27 meeting where the selected prosecutors' fates were sealed.\n        The hearing brought out evidence that Mr. Sampson also may have made false statements. A Feb. 23 letter to Congress based on information from Mr. Sampson stated that Karl Rove was not involved in replacing the United States attorney in Arkansas with Timothy Griffin, Mr. Rove's former aide. Mr. Sampson could not convincingly explain why he wrote that, when he had said in an e-mail message two months earlier that getting Mr. Griffin appointed was ''important'' to Mr. Rove. He finally acknowledged that he had discussed the appointment with Mr. Rove's two top aides.\n        The senators questioning Mr. Sampson pointed to a troubling pattern: many of the fired prosecutors were investigating high-ranking Republicans. He was asked if he was aware that the fired United States attorney in Nevada was investigating a Republican governor, that the fired prosecutor in Arkansas was investigating the Republican governor of Missouri, or that the prosecutor in Arizona was investigating two Republican members of Congress.\n        Mr. Sampson's claim that he had only casual knowledge of these highly sensitive investigations was implausible, unless we are to believe that Mr. Gonzales runs a department in which the chief of staff is merely a political hack who has no hand in its substantive work. He added to the suspicions that partisan politics were involved when he made the alarming admission that in the middle of the Scooter Libby investigation, he suggested firing Patrick Fitzgerald, the United States attorney in Chicago who was the special prosecutor in the case.\n        The administration insists that purge was not about partisan politics. But Mr. Sampson's alternative explanation was not very credible -- that the decision about which of these distinguished prosecutors should be fired was left in the hands of someone as young and inept as Mr. Sampson. If this were an aboveboard, professional process, it strains credulity that virtually no documents were produced when decisions were made, and that none of his recommendations to Mr. Gonzales were in writing.\n        It is no wonder that the White House is trying to stop Congress from questioning Mr. Rove, Harriet Miers, the former White House counsel, and other top officials in public, under oath and with a transcript. The more the administration tries to spin the prosecutor purge, the worse it looks.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":4,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1833828,"ids":1833828,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"In its athletic mission statement, Rutgers University proudly proclaims that its sports program operates in a manner consistent with ''intellectual inquiry'' and ''academic success.'' It states that ''the intrinsic value to the participant is the primary criterion by which the worth of the program is judged.''\n        But many students, parents and alumni are wondering whether those fine words have any meaning these days at the New Jersey state university. The school seems determined to eliminate six Olympic sports from the varsity level even though the teams boast some of the best academic records on campus.\n        Men's swimming and diving, men's tennis, men's light and heavyweight crew, and men's and women's fencing would all be downgraded to the club level. More than 60 nonsenior varsity athletes, some on scholarships based in part on their athletic accomplishment, would be adversely affected.\n        At first, the university insisted the cuts were required by an $80.4 million budget shortfall, resulting from the state's fiscal crisis and Gov. Jon Corzine's budget cuts. But that argument was never persuasive since elimination of the sports, at most, would save only $800,000 in a total athletic budget of more than $35 million.\n        After a group of parents, alumni and interested citizens received pledges for more than the amount needed to continue the sports for another year, university officials modified their line and conceded that eliminating the sports has been under consideration for years. The budget problems simply brought the decision to a head, the university's president, Richard McCormick, said.\n        In fact, football is the name of the game these days at Rutgers, which seems determined to turn its team into a national power rivaling Ohio State, Michigan, and the University of Florida. Spending on football has increased substantially in recent years. And the head coach, Greg Schiano, who last season led the team to a national No. 12 ranking, was rewarded with a raise of at least $500,000 and will make $1.5 million for the season before any bonuses.\n        But none of this should require the downgrading of six less luminous sports, especially since private donors are eager to contribute to their financing, and at least one member of the university's Board of Governors agrees.\n        George Zoffinger, who is also director of the Meadowlands sports authority and is known for his outspokenness, says it is unfair to eliminate the varsity teams since many of the players rejected offers from other top colleges and universities in favor of the sports programs at Rutgers. One, a fencer on one of the most prestigious scholarships the school has to offer, had been admitted to three Ivy League colleges, and several others were awarded merit scholarships.\n        Mr. Zoffinger has suggested that a small portion of the proceeds from the football games be used to support the six sports for at least another year, but he predicted that even that modest proposal would be rejected. University officials, he said, see this controversy as a battle of egos.\n        So we would pose this question to Mr. McCormick: What is more important, winning this scrimmage against a small group of student athletes and their supporters, or living up to the fine Rutgers standard in which the worth of a sports program is judged by ''the intrinsic value to the participant?''","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1644158,"ids":1644158,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In many places on Long Island, the demographics are so entrenched they seem embedded in the local geology -- like lush Garden City, the very definition of a wealthy white enclave of single-family homes, and its racially diverse, working-class neighbor Hempstead.\n        This is why we so regret the impending sale by Nassau County of a property it owns in Garden City.

Or will they allow Albany to remain a national joke? Both candidates for governor have spoken in detail about their ideas for reform. But legislators can stall, hinder or sabotage any gubernatorial proposal that might hurt their own cushy jobs.\n        Members of the Assembly and State Senate, who are seldom even challenged in elections, may be hoping that any reform talk -- even the stuff on their own campaign fliers -- will start to fade the moment everyone is sworn in next year. So nab your local candidates at the subway or street corner, and say that you'll withhold your support unless he or she fights, really fights, for reform.\n        Among the most important areas are these:\n        Campaign Finance. New York's campaign finance system is a disgrace. The limits are too high, and as for soft money channeled to the party instead of individual candidates, there are no real limits at all. Nor is there any enforcement. The State Senate has been the roadblock to reform, and Senate candidates should be asked how they would do better.\n        Redistricting. The hardest and most important task for the next governor and Legislature is to establish an independent, nonpartisan commission to create legislative and Congressional districts. Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the leading candidate for governor, says he's on board with this idea. But even if he wins the election, he will have to fight fiercely to win this battle.\n        Lobbying Reform.  Albany's lawmakers have made some slight progress on lobbying reform, but the latest changes in the regulations governing lobbying for state contracts have not yet been enforced. And David Grandeau, the executive director of the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying, has been forced to battle to keep his job and make his commission aggressive.

So it is encouraging that the agency has proposed new rules to exclude experts who have significant financial ties to regulated industries from serving on committees that recommend whether a product should be approved.\n        The proposed rules may still need to be strengthened after they are critiqued during a required comment period. But even in their current form they look like a big, and long needed, improvement over the agency's previously lax efforts to screen out conflicts of interest. The pharmaceutical industry, in particular, doles out lots of money to doctors and academic experts in the form of speaking fees, consultancies, research grants and other financial benefits. And many of these recipients end up on federal advisory committees.\n        All too often consumer interests are shortchanged. In one egregious example, a panel that favored marketing the controversial painkillers Bextra and Vioxx would have made the opposite recommendation if the experts with industry ties had been excluded from voting.\n        The new rules would bar from an advisory committee anyone whose financial interests in a company with a product up for review -- or its competitors -- exceed $50,000, whether in stock ownership, consulting arrangements or individual research grants. Those with smaller financial interests could participate in discussions but would not be allowed to vote. Only those with no potential conflicts could participate as full, voting members. The food and drug commissioner could still grant waivers, but officials expect them to be rare.\n        Some patient advocates believe the $50,000 exclusion is too generous, and the agency needs to explain more fully how it decided that was the proper cutoff point. It also needs to address whether nonvoting experts -- those with smaller financial ties -- might still unduly sway a committee's decision.\n        Congress needs to confront another worrisome source of industry's influence: the $300 million in annual fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers that help finance the approval process and regulation of drugs. Critics have long complained that these user fees distort the agency's objectivity and make for a too cozy atmosphere between the industry and its regulators.\n        The Bush administration, unfortunately, is seeking to increase reliance on user fees. That's the wrong direction to go.

Families that can't fight unfair evictions, after all, end up in homeless shelters, right next to the children and spouses of deadbeat fathers. People rejected for Medicaid wind up in emergency rooms. New York State recognized this long ago, but its legal safety net happens to be more threadbare than others.\n        This is partly because of the relative meagerness of state financing -- about $17.5 million in a state where 2.7 million people live in poverty -- and the way it is allocated. The system is supported not by a general budget appropriation but through member items, the secret river of cash controlled by individual lawmakers and doled out in annual bursts of ad-hoc generosity. Other funding for legal help is spread around among 10 or more agencies.\n        The issue is particularly relevant in Westchester, where legal advocates for the poor once had a friend in State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a powerful Republican who in recent years treated legal aid as an important constituent service. Mr. Spano is gone now, of course, which could be bad news for Legal Services of the Hudson Valley, the only nonprofit organization in the region that provides free, high-quality legal help to low-income people.\n        The organization is stretched over seven counties -- Westchester, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan and Ulster -- and, like other nonprofit legal-assistance organizations, estimates that it turns away about half the people who come to it for help.\n        The Westchester executive, Board of Legislators and county bar association should make sure that life after Mr. Spano does not create short-term hardship for Legal Services of the Hudson Valley. And in the longer run, there should be a better system. Advocates for the poor have urged Gov.

M. Jodi Rell and the minority Republicans by that deadline. Yet nothing is certain, and the issues are difficult.\n        The Republicans, for instance, at one point suggested that they would vote for the earned income tax credit for the working poor, favored by Democrats, if the Democrats agreed to phase out the state's inheritance tax. That seems absurd on its face; the inheritance tax brings in $180 million a year, while the earned income tax credit would cost $55 million in its first year.\n        The truth is that it should take only about three hours to complete a budget deal; the problem is that nobody ever really knows when those three hours will occur. One thing seems clear: A budget will pass when both sides remember why they are in office and stop posturing over their favorite proposals, none of which stand much of a chance.\n        Meanwhile, several measures that actually deserve to pass have been held up by the budget stalemate.

The changes went too far. The proposal approved by the Judiciary Committee was the better version, and if that has a prayer of being resurrected, it is worth passing. Otherwise, a constitutional amendment is still the best alternative.\n        Change the law that treats juveniles as adults. Connecticut is one of only a few states that treats 16- and 17-year-olds who commit serious crimes as adults, an expensive and shortsighted policy that gives great power to judges and prosecutors and emphasizes incarceration over rehabilitation.

Although habeas traces to Magna Carta and is enshrined in the Constitution, Congress may be about to scale it back drastically. The proposed changes would make the criminal justice system less fair and far more likely to convict the innocent.\n        Criminal prosecutions do not always work the way they should. Prosecutors may improperly reject prospective jurors on the basis of race. Evidence tying a defendant to a crime is sometimes trumped up, while evidence that casts doubt on a defendant's guilt is sometimes hidden. Habeas corpus allows state prisoners to go into federal court and raise constitutional objections to their convictions. Often they prevail. A few months ago, the Supreme Court overturned a capital conviction in Texas when it found that the prosecutor had kept blacks off the jury.\n        Critics of habeas corpus petitions complain that they slow down the justice system, particularly the execution of convicts. There may be room for carefully calibrated modifications, but the changes Congress is considering are not that. The sponsors named their bill, which is now modestly different in the Senate and House versions, the Streamlined Procedures Act, making it appear to be a mere attempt at efficiency.

Not quite. The deficit declined, but not by half, from $412 billion to $248 billion. If you measure it as a percentage of the economy, Mr. Bush was off by an amount equal to about $15 billion.\n        Then, Mr. Bush greatly compounded his otherwise modest exaggeration by taking credit for the reduction, when the deficit really fell despite his policies, not because of them. The distinction is crucial, to understand both the current mess -- in which debt is mounting just as huge obligations are coming due for Medicare and Social Security -- and how best to get out of it.\n        The drop in the deficit over the past few years was due largely to the cyclical recovery from the earlier recession, and to a boost in revenue when temporary business tax cuts expired after 2004.\n        Mr. Bush, meanwhile, has pursued a single-minded strategy of spending more while slashing taxes. That is the opposite of deficit reduction; it has made the budget hole deeper than it would have been. Still, Mr. Bush wants you to believe that tax cuts caused the economic recovery, and thus the budget improvement. If you follow that logic, the key to continued improvement would be continued tax cuts, and that is just what Mr. Bush called for last week. He conjured a bright future in which the deficit disappears after he leaves office, without anyone ever having to raise taxes.\n        That was the speech, and then there is reality, which came knocking within days when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its annual 10-year budget outlook. The outlook is for a cumulative deficit of $2.9 trillion to $3.4 trillion -- about $300 billion a year -- if, as Mr. Bush wishes, the tax cuts are extended beyond their scheduled expiration in 2010 and tax relief continues for Americans wrongly afflicted by the alternative minimum tax. In arriving at its estimate, the budget agency also assumed that costs for the war in Iraq would start going down next year, an assumption that, if proved wrong, would result in even higher deficits.\n        In the absence of overt tax increases, that leaves Mr. Bush only three ways to erase the deficit. He would have to make pie-in-the-sky assumptions of revenue growth, which would be dicey in any event, but folly at a time when the economy is slowing. He would have to renege on his pledge to protect taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax, a huge backdoor tax increase. Or he would have to persuade lawmakers to make cuts in spending even more draconian than those already dodged by the previous Republican-controlled Congress.\n        Fortunately, such cuts are necessary only if one accepts Mr. Bush's premise that taxes must never rise under any circumstances. That is clearly a false premise. Mr. Bush's tax cuts should largely be allowed to expire. Facing that truth is not a fiscal challenge, it's a political one.\n        Mr. Bush will not meet it.

The theatrics could be fascinating. But what makes the case truly compelling is the substance. The case, Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, challenges two longstanding pillars of abortion rights jurisprudence, reproductive freedom and the authority of the courts. Both have real-world consequences for the lives of women and the rule of law.\n        The substantive issue first: The Supreme Court has ruled that states can require that doctors notify a pregnant teenager's parent before performing an abortion. But the court has also made it clear, beginning with its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, that any restrictions on abortion rights must contain exceptions to protect a woman's health and life. This is a core principle that New Hampshire lawmakers ignored in 2003 when they passed a parental notification law that omitted any exception for medical problems that were not life-threatening.\n        Quite predictably, the law was challenged. Two days before it was to take effect, a federal trial judge in New Hampshire issued an injunction barring its enforcement. Neither the trial judge nor the reviewing appellate court had any trouble dismissing the claim by New Hampshire's attorney general, Kelly Ayotte, that the state had covered the problem of the health exception by giving a pregnant minor the option of seeking permission for an abortion from a judge. Neither should the justices. In an emergency, as Planned Parenthood of Northern New England notes in its brief, a young woman needs to get to a hospital, not a courthouse.\n        The implications of the procedural issue are even more serious. With support from the Justice Department, Ms. Ayotte is asking the court to end, or severely constrict, the longstanding power of federal courts to do what the trial judge in New Hampshire did: bar the enforcement of potentially dangerous and unconstitutional abortion restrictions before they go into effect and injure people. Though it is obscured by technical-sounding legalese, this issue concerns what would essentially be a radical court-stripping plan, one that would leave state legislatures free to ignore the Supreme Court's parameters for abortion regulation until a minor, already unconstitutionally endangered and in the midst of a medical crisis, somehow made it to court to challenge the law.\n        The Supreme Court should see this argument for what it is: an attack on the federal courts and on women's rights and health.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1683431,"ids":1683431,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"In the battle against AIDS, the Bush administration is both savior and scoundrel.

Administration officials have said that without approval from the Food and Drug Administration, they can't be sure that generics are safe and effective, even though the World Health Organization has endorsed many of them and AIDS programs around the world use them with excellent results. It's not a question of science: the drugs cannot be used in the United States because they would violate patents, so the F.D.A. never examined them.\n        Until now. Last week, the F.D.A. approved for overseas use two Indian-made generic versions of nevirapine, a standard ingredient in the triple cocktail, and a generic version of efavirenz, another widely used antiretroviral. That brings the number of approved generic antiretrovirals to seven. While none are yet in use in Washington's overseas programs, the approvals will eventually allow four times as many lives to be saved for the same amount of money.\n        Also last week, however, the administration was on a moral crusade that could lead to a significant rise in AIDS cases in Russia, China, elsewhere in Asia and in the former East bloc. In these places, drug users who inject are a prime risk group for AIDS, and the gateway through which the epidemic will spread into the general population. As many as a third of new AIDS infections outside sub-Saharan Africa are in drug users; in Russia, Unaids estimates that injecting drug users are 80 percent of the infected. Needle exchange programs can help control this part of the epidemic.\n        But at a Unaids policy meeting this month, a Bush administration official asked that all references to needle exchange be dropped from the group's governing policy paper.\n        Unaids doesn't control much money, but it sets world policy on how to fight AIDS, and usually operates by consensus to give its recommendations more force. Although America is virtually alone in its opposition to needle exchange, its clout as the largest Unaids donor means it might be able to win a vote this week in the group's program coordination board. If Unaids could no longer work on needle exchange, nations would lose a valuable source of technical help. And a lack of consensus could keep countries from starting needle exchanges.\n        American law already forbids United States money from financing needle exchange programs. For Washington to decide that it wants to stop everyone else from doing that is a breathtakingly dangerous step.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1826378,"ids":1826378,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In the coming week, the House is expected to pass a bipartisan bill aimed at scaling down the unwise tax cuts that the Senate has demanded in exchange for raising the federal minimum wage. The House measure contains only modest tax cuts, worth $1.3 billion over the next 10 years, and is focused on the small businesses that are most likely to be harmed by a higher minimum wage, like mom-and-pop restaurants. We would have preferred a straightforward minimum wage increase. But the House bill is a reasonable response to the Senate's refusal to move forward without tax cuts.\n        Whether senators will find the moral clarity to see it that way is another matter.\n        In Round 1 of this year's effort to raise the minimum wage, the House passed a clean bill, raising the wage from a pitiful $5.15 an hour, where it has been stuck for 10 years, to $7.25 by 2009. In Round 2, the Senate refused to follow the House's lead. Acting as if the midterm elections had never happened, it passed a bill that pairs the wage increase with special-interest tax cuts priced at $8.3 billion over the next 10 years.\n        The ultimate cost would probably be much higher because most of the proposed tax cuts were designated as ''temporary.'' If those temporary measures were renewed -- and temporary tax cuts are almost always renewed -- the 10-year cost of the Senate's bill would reach $47.5 billion.\n        And that's not the only way the Senate bill is objectionable. Many of the Senate's proposed tax cuts would do more for big business, which is largely unaffected by a rise in the minimum wage, than for the typical small business. Big chain stores and big landlords would be the hands-down winners from proposed tax breaks for building new retail stores and new restaurants, and for improving existing structures.\n        Moreover, the tax cuts that small businesses may be able to latch onto are overly broad, rather than narrowly targeted. As such, they conflict with many senators' recent pledges to close the tax gap, the estimated $300 billion in taxes that are owed but unpaid. It's common knowledge that much of the gap is due to unreported cash and overstated deductions from self-employed people, family businesses and family farms. It makes no sense to grant broad tax cuts to taxpayers in that group until lawmakers find ways to ensure that they are paying their fair share to begin with.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1742594,"ids":1742594,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"In the hall of fame of suburban atrocities, leaf blowers deserve their own wing.\n        They are dirty and deafening and pointlessly efficient.

But since when was that ever necessary, or even desirable?\n        By what obsessive standard of outdoor tidiness must we blow our lawns and blacktop driveways into a state of shiny specklessness, with every last leaf or grain of sand banished to the street?\n        And what grotesque level of self-absorption makes us think we have the right to wake up the whole block on Saturday morning to do this, hiring squads of day laborers to mount a gas-powered assault on yard waste?\n        Do we do it just because we can? Does Martha Stewart have something to do with this?\n        The leaf blower represents everything that people say is bad about the suburban lifestyle -- its obsession with appearances, its heedless hostility to neighbors and the environment, and its elevation of neatness and conformity into the ultimate aesthetic ideal. Leaf blowers stink, and they smell bad, too.\n        The trouble is, it is very hard to ban them, and even if you could, that would only make life much harder for the landscaping crews who rely on efficiency and speed to turn a profit. Leaf blowers help leaf-blowing guys make a living, and unless some monumental shift in the suburban mindset causes homeowners to climb en masse from their La-Z-Boys and get their rakes out, the men with the roaring backpacks are here to stay.\n        But that doesn't mean things are hopeless. Thrilling news has emerged in the Los Angeles area, where the South Coast Air Quality Management District is encouraging landscapers to replace their old, dirty leaf blowers with new machines that run cleaner and more quietly. People who turn in old blowers will be able to buy the lower-emission blowers at a deep discount -- $200, or less than half the retail price. Their four-stroke engines are about one-fifth as dirty as the older, two-stroke models, which means a lot in a region beset by smog, where a single gas-powered blower can emit as much pollution in a year as 80 cars.\n        The program is the first in the country. It should not be the last. Astute politicians in leaf-blowing zones should take a cue from their West Coast counterparts and find ways to get old blowers off the streets. It would take a little ingenuity and arm-twisting and cost some money, but the rewards -- in easier breathing and Saturday slumber -- would be immeasurable.\n        Note to Paul Feiner, Greenburgh town supervisor: Are you reading this?","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1698360,"ids":1698360,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"In the last 30 years, Robert Morgenthau has given Manhattan a world-class district attorney's office. It pains us not to be able to endorse him for re-election. But we believe that there is a limit to how long any manager can stay at one job and continue to administer with vigor and openness to new ideas. Three decades is more than enough time for any executive to accomplish his or her mission.\n        Mr. Morgenthau's many supporters tend to portray any questions about the length of his tenure as a kind of age discrimination. The Manhattan district attorney is 86, but he is still mentally sharp and in good health. If he were running for a third, fourth or perhaps even a fifth four-year term, the argument over re-electing him would be very different. If he had not been virtually unopposed for at least 20 years' worth of campaigns, no doubt  the question of succession would have come up earlier.\n        But this year, Mr. Morgenthau does have a qualified opponent, Leslie Crocker Snyder. An able former state judge and prosecutor, Ms. Snyder has run hard against very long odds, given the extremely high profile and almost iconic status of her opponent, who has declined to appear in any televised debates.\n        Some of her criticism of the current district attorney's office is well taken. Mr. Morgenthau has been very resistant to the kinds of fresh approaches that have improved law enforcement services in other boroughs. His office fought against community courts, for example, although some have been established in Manhattan in the last decade or so. It continues to resist a specialized court to handle the most serious cases of domestic violence. The office sometimes seems set in its ways: when a man who had been sent to prison in a fatal nightclub shooting nearly 15 years ago was recently cleared, based on a belated finding that there was inadequate evidence to support the conviction, Mr. Morgenthau refused to acknowledge that an injustice had been done to that man or that there had been anything wrong with the original prosecution.\n        There are some aspects of Ms. Snyder's record that give us pause. Unlike Mr. Morgenthau, she supports the death penalty. Her overall service on the bench, which included presiding over a host of violent criminal cases, when her own life was threatened, underscores her personal bravery, but also a worrisome fondness for publicity. Ms. Snyder has criticized Mr. Morgenthau for devoting a large portion of his office's time to white-collar crimes that federal prosecutors could handle. We trust that does not signal an intention to abandon a key role in helping to oversee the integrity of financial institutions.\n        Nevertheless, Ms. Snyder is a lawyer of unquestioned ability and broad experience who understands the vast power that prosecutors wield and seems prepared to exercise it with proper restraint. She would come to the district attorney's office with impressive energy, new ideas and an obvious passion for building on Mr. Morgenthau's record. With due respect for the incumbent's legendary tenure, it is time for a change. We endorse Leslie Crocker Snyder for Manhattan district attorney.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1716396,"ids":1716396,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In the last couple of days, the Republican leaders of Congress have been piously demanding a full investigation into the sources of a Washington Post article about the Central Intelligence Agency's chain of secret prison camps. These same leaders have spent 18 months crushing any serious look at the actual abuse of prisoners at those camps, and at camps run by the American military. And for more than two years, they have expressed no interest in whether the White House leaked the name of a covert C.I.A. operative to punish a critic of the Iraq war.\n        So why did they jump on last week's article in The Post before you could say ''double standard''? The answer is painfully obvious: G.O.P. leaders, doing the White House's bidding, are trying to shut down discussion of the policies that led to the horrors of Abu Ghraib and the C.I.A.'s ''black site'' prisons. They are also delivering an oblique warning to the Democrats who want the Senate to say more than the White House wants to be said about another sensitive intelligence matter: whether President Bush and his team hyped Iraq's weapons programs.\n        This new political drama makes an excellent case study for why it is so vital for news organizations to be able to give the public information that the government wants to suppress for political reasons. That sort of journalism depends on maintaining the confidentiality of sources. For that reason, we generally oppose leak investigations.\n        This page did support the independent investigation into the Valerie Wilson case -- rather than having the administration continue its own inquiry -- not to stop leaks, but to determine whether administration officials had abused their power and possibly endangered Mrs. Wilson, an undercover C.I.A. officer, to undermine her husband, Joseph Wilson. He had drawn the White House's ire by disputing one of the central and ultimately false justifications for war with Iraq: that there was an active effort by Saddam Hussein to get parts for a nuclear bomb.\n        The current talk of leaks is utterly different. The Post article provided powerful details that expand what we know about the camps and the abhorrent practices there. The administration and its allies in Congress want to suppress this information merely because they don't want a full accounting of how American soldiers and intelligence agents have been turned into torturers, and because the administration wants to go on abusing prisoners.\n        Some Republicans are saying The Post's article damaged America's image, harmed national security and jeopardized American soldiers and agents. We've heard that absurd attempt to blame the messenger before. It sounds particularly preposterous at a time when the administration is attempting to stave off attempts to outlaw the use of torture against prisoners.\n        The truth is that the damage is caused by the administration's underlying acts and policies, not by the news media's disclosures, which serve only to hold officials accountable for their actions. It is the secret camps themselves and the abuse and torture of prisoners that smear America's image and jeopardize Americans serving their country, not newspaper articles.\n        If Republican leaders in Congress want to open investigations that serve the public, they can back an independent investigation into the origins of the Abu Ghraib scandal -- and they can take the handcuffs off the unfinished Senate investigation into the prewar intelligence on Iraq.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1819839,"ids":1819839,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In the long and sordid story of Hurricane Katrina, a new low may be approaching. In Louisiana alone, tens of thousands of displaced families who rely on the government to provide trailers or rent will lose their temporary housing next month -- unless the Bush administration extends the standard 18-month time limit for their federal aid.\n        A year and a half is a long time for anything that is supposed to be transitional, as the families still trapped in cramped, flimsy trailers can testify. But the temporary help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency cannot end until the victims have somewhere else to go. And the federal and local governments have moved far too slowly in providing the necessary reconstruction money and building guidance. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed more than 200,000 homes in Louisiana, and only a small fraction have been replaced. (Neither the state nor the New Orleans city government knows how many have been completed.) A sky-high murder rate has dominated the news. The success of the Saints professional football team is not enough of a distraction.\n        The response to the drowning of New Orleans has been a failure on every level. President Bush's eloquent promise in Jackson Square to rebuild ''higher and better'' soothed the nation. But since then there has been no concrete action plan for reconstruction -- only a patchwork of programs marked by dithering, bickering and bureaucratic finger-pointing throughout. The federal response was, after great delay, largely to cut a check and let overmatched local officials try to sort it out.\n        The president's Katrina czar, Donald Powell, sees his role as one of a convener, adviser and advocate rather than leader of a domestic Marshall Plan -- which is what New Orleans needs. He says that local officials should take the lead. But the local reconstruction plan has yet to materialize. City officials hope that it will be out by the end of the month.\n        There is some local optimism that when it does arrive there will be a burst of rebuilding effort. Developers are finally beginning to break ground on apartment complexes. The city has issued more than 55,000 residential building permits since the storm, finally moving at a faster rate than before Katrina.\n        But the time is long past to turn from planning to action. And those in need of shelter today cannot take comfort in housing that won't be ready for another two years. The administration must extend the temporary housing provisions immediately, then make every effort to shift aid recipients to the longer-term Section 8 voucher program.\n        The new Democratic leaders in Congress also need to recognize that the many failures of Hurricane Katrina are more than just another reason to criticize the president. They need to quickly outline their own plans for salvaging New Orleans, so evacuees can once again call their city home.\n        That New Orleans remains a shattered city is a sad monument to impotence for the most powerful country in the world. Our grand plans were never laid, our brightest minds were never assembled, our nation's muscle and ingenuity were never brought to bear in any concerted way to overcome the crisis of the Gulf.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1713893,"ids":1713893,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In the national anguish after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Congress rushed to enact a formidable antiterrorism law -- the Patriot Act -- that significantly crimped civil liberties by expanding law enforcement's power to use wiretaps, search warrants and other surveillance techniques, often under the cloak of secrecy. There was virtually no public debate before these major changes to the nation's legal system were put into effect.\n        Now, with some of the act's most sweeping powers set to expire at the end of the year, the two houses of Congress face crucial negotiations, which will also take place out of public view, on their differences over how to extend and amend the law. That's controversy enough. But the increasingly out-of-control House of Representatives has made the threat to our system of justice even greater by inserting a raft of provisions to enlarge the scope of the federal death penalty.\n        In a breathtaking afterthought at the close of debate, the House voted to triple the number of terrorism-related crimes carrying the death penalty. The House also voted to allow judges to reduce the size of juries that decide on executions, and even to permit prosecutors to try repeatedly for a death sentence when a hung jury fails to vote for death.\n        The radical amendment was slapped through by the Republican leadership without serious debate. The Justice Department has endorsed the House measure, and Representative James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Judiciary Committee chairman, who is ever on the side of more government power over the individual, is promising to fight hard for the death penalty provisions.\n        There are now 20 terrorism-related crimes eligible for capital punishment, and the House measure would add 41 more. These would make it easier for prosecutors to win a death sentence in cases where a defendant had no intent to kill -- for example, if a defendant gave financial support to an umbrella organization without realizing that some of its adherents might eventually commit violence.\n        Any move to weaken the American jury system in the name of fighting terrorism is particularly egregious. But the House voted to allow a federal trial to have fewer than 12 jurors if the judge finds ''good cause'' to do so, even if the defense objects. Under current law, a life sentence is automatically ordered when juries become hung on deciding the capital punishment question. But the House would have a prosecutor try again -- a license for jury-shopping for death -- even though federal juries already exclude opponents of capital punishment.\n        The House's simplistic vote for another ''crackdown'' gesture can only further sully the notion of patriotism in a renewed Patriot Act.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":4,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1822375,"ids":1822375,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In the old days, presidential races were one-year events. John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy on Jan. 2, 1960, and was elected that November. Earlier this month, would-be candidates who were still deciding whether to run in 2008 were being accused of reckless delay. Presidential campaign pundits were saying that if Senator Hillary Clinton had waited another minute to announce, Senator Barack Obama would have locked up every New Hampshire county committee member and hedge fund billionaire.\n        This really is an election on hyperspeed.\n        Part of this is due to the peculiarities of the race. President Bush is so unpopular that a power vacuum is opening up in Washington and, for the first time in many election cycles, both parties' nominations are wide open. The Internet is also fueling the overdrive, with ''netroots primaries,'' in which the voting has already begun.\n        The biggest factors, though, are money and an ever-compressed schedule. California, Illinois, Florida and New Jersey are all maneuvering to move up their primaries to next February. That has candidates rushing to lock up the big donors -- and bypassing the public finance system. Senator Clinton has already made clear that she will be opting out for both the primary and the general election. Senator John McCain, a major supporter of campaign finance reform who is no longer sponsoring a big reform bill that once bore his name, seems likely to do the same, with many candidates to follow. The problem with the 23-month campaign is not just the fatigue it will inspire, but the effect on democracy. Bundlers -- master fund-raisers who package individual contributions into big ones -- will have even more power. There is no way to stop candidates from hurling their hats into the ring so early. But there are things that can, and should, be done.\n        The national parties should stop the states' mad race to have first-in-the-nation primaries. They should adopt a schedule that reformers have been proposing for years: regional primaries that rotate, so that voters in every state eventually have a turn to be among the first to vote. Congress should fix the broken public financing system, which has not been significantly updated since it was adopted in 1974. Spending limits need to be raised, to keep pace with ever-rising costs. More money needs to be put in the fund, and there should be more flexibility to help candidates who accept public financing compete against big-money candidates who opt out.\n        If Hillary vs. Obama vs. Rudy vs. McCain is already starting to feel old, remember that there are more than 600 days to go.

If that makes no sense elsewhere, it is perfectly understandable in Albany. There, the new comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, has proposed a plan to begin public financing of state campaigns, starting with the race for comptroller in 2010.\n        Public financing, in which smaller campaign donations from individuals would be matched in statewide races, would be a great idea for New York. And Gov. Eliot Spitzer has pledged to promote some kind of public financing as part of his general overhaul of state government. Mr. Spitzer argues, however, that coaxing lawmakers into reforming the present system takes top priority. Unfortunately, that shoves public financing, which would bring New York in line with more progressive states, into the future.\n        Viewed in that context, the DiNapoli proposal feels too much like a feint, one of many Albany press releases that goes no farther than the official state Web site.\n        Mr. DiNapoli's ideas have some merit. The plan would require public debates, for example. But it would also require the state to match contributions up to the first $2,500. Since a donor could give up to $10,000 under this plan, the state contribution could bring the total per donor to a high of $12,500. That skews the program towards larger contributors instead of smaller donations, which is what public financing should be about. New York City's system, for instance, matches only the first $250 of a contribution. This preferred method of financing encourages candidates to focus on the little guy. It also encourages the participation of candidates who have less access to rich donors.\n        The financing of any comptroller's race needs to be carefully monitored by watchdog groups. The comptroller controls investments of the state's $147 billion pension fund, which means that large fees could be doled out to businesses willing to pony up campaign funds. Even by New York State standards, this is pay for play on a very big scale.\n        Mr. DiNapoli is right to see that the present system has plenty of flaws. But it would help if he could use more of his influence with the Legislature that elected him to make certain that the entire campaign financing system is overhauled immediately. So far, Albany -- particularly the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, and his Republican senators -- cannot seem to agree on any substantial reform. They clearly do not want to hobble that golden goose anytime soon.\n        Mr. Spitzer's only real leverage lies in rejecting a pay raise for lawmakers until they start cleaning up the fund-raising system. As the governor keeps his thumb on those bigger paychecks, advocates of reform in Albany, including Mr. DiNapoli, should keep pushing legislators to limit the money pouring into their ever-fattening campaign accounts.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1837533,"ids":1837533,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"In the world of private equity, ''2 and 20'' is a formula for making money. The mavens of the industry -- venture capitalists and buyout specialists -- generally collect a management fee of 2 percent of the assets they manage and a performance fee equal to 20 percent of any profits. With hundreds of billions of dollars flowing through the 2-and-20 structure, the megabucks pile up quickly.\n        High fees, however, are only one reason that private equity lives by ''2 and 20.'' Another is low taxes.\n        Partners in private equity ventures treat their performance fees as capital gains -- in other words, like profits on the sale of a stock -- and thus pay tax on the fees at a rate of 15 percent, about the lowest in the tax code. According to federal partnership tax rules, that's legal. But the rules were developed before private equity became the force it is today, and mainly with small business and real estate partnerships in mind.\n        Some lawmakers -- notably Senator Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Charles Grassley, the committee's top Republican -- have begun to question whether those rules should apply to private equity.\n        Adding grist to lawmakers' skepticism is a recent paper by Victor Fleischer, an associate professor at the University of Colorado Law School. Mr. Fleischer makes several arguments against treating performance pay as capital gain, starting with the increasingly huge sums that private equity firms raise from tax-exempt investors, like pension funds and endowments.\n        In general, when corporate executives get performance-based pay, like stock options, they don't have to pay tax right away. That's a big tax benefit, but it leaves the government no worse off because the corporation also delays taking a deduction for the payment. There is no such offset when private equity partners are paid by tax-exempt investors. The nation in effect waits longer for its tax revenue and gets less, as private equity partners get more.\n        The deeper question in all this is whether capital gains -- which are currently taxed at less than half the top rate of ordinary income -- should continue to be so lavishly advantaged. The answer there is no. Today's preferential rate for capital gains is excessive, with no mechanism in the tax code to ensure that it is not overused. Excessively favoring one form of income over another encourages wasteful gamesmanship, creates inequity and crowds out other ways to foster risk-taking. Tackling the too-easy tax terms for private equity is a good way for Congress to begin addressing that bigger issue.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1854595,"ids":1854595,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"In two days of fierce fighting, the gunmen of Hamas have virtually taken over the Gaza Strip. This is a defeat for Palestinians, and a defeat for Israeli and American policy as well.\n        It may sometimes look like there's not very much of a choice between the gunmen of Fatah and the gunmen of Hamas. But there is. Fatah accepts Israel's existence and wants to negotiate with it over Palestinian statehood. It also accepts the authority of past agreements signed by the Palestinians, including agreements to stop terrorism. Hamas accepts none of these things, and sees no contradiction between its terrorist deeds and its demands that its governing officials be treated like those of any state.\n        Ever since Hamas won Palestinian legislative elections last January, President Bush and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel have done everything they could think of to isolate Hamas and far less than they might have to help Fatah's most important remaining leader, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.\n        Seventeen months later, Hamas is that much stronger and Fatah is that much weaker. With the pretense of joint government now shattered, the Palestinian power struggle is certain to continue, even to intensify. Yesterday, Mr. Abbas dismissed the prime minister, Ismail Haniya of Hamas, and called for new elections. With Hamas victorious in Gaza, the terrain of the contest will likely shift to the West Bank.\n        For Washington and Jerusalem to exert constructive influence in this dangerous situation, they urgently need to adopt a new and wiser approach to Palestinian politics. That means doing more to help Mr. Abbas in the only currency that really counts, easing the lives of ordinary Palestinians.\n        That should include a total freeze on settlement building and expansion, a prompt easing of the onerous, humiliating and economically strangulating blockades on Palestinian movements within the West Bank, and the swift release to Mr. Abbas's office of all tax revenues rightfully belonging to the Palestinians but still in Israeli hands.\n        It should also include an offer of regular, substantive talks with Mr. Abbas on issues related to a final peace settlement, like borders and provisions assuring the economic viability of an eventual Palestinian state. Obviously, there can be no final peace agreement until Hamas either changes its policies or is chased from power. But excluding Palestinian statehood from the negotiating agenda can only help Hamas.\n        Hamas's future diplomatic treatment should depend strictly on its own behavior. If it is ever willing to stop engaging in terrorism and live up to the standards expected of law-abiding governments, there will be something for Israeli and American officials to discuss with it. The past few days offer little encouragement in that regard.\n        Taking these kind of risks to help Mr. Abbas looks a lot dicier now than it did 17 months ago, or even 17 days ago.

During Mardi Gras, 911 calls usually triple. It is frightening to think what could happen without additional resources. In emergency medicine, delays can lead to fatalities. The last thing New Orleans needs is more preventable deaths. The city's convention center announced that it would allow the temporary clinic there to operate through Fat Tuesday, the final day of celebration before the beginning of Lent. As of right now, officials say they expect Tulane University Hospital and Clinic to partly reopen in time for the carnival celebration. If the university and its partner, the hospital company HCA, can get the doors open by then it would be a major step toward averting disaster.\n        It's not enough. So far, the city has been unable to scrape together even small additions to prepare for Mardi Gras. Officials have asked for tents to expand the convention-center clinic and a mobile medical unit with 60 more beds for patients. But that is where the bureaucratic morass begins. City requests must be sent through the State of Louisiana, which forwards them to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for consideration. FEMA is still considering the request for the mobile unit, even as the clock is ticking down.\n        Let's see. Impending problem, clear needs and no one taking responsibility. Sound familiar?\n        This is unacceptable. These reasonable requests must be met, even if Congress has to take special action to ensure that it happens. The sad fact is that New Orleans has all but dropped off the map of national priorities. Listening to President Bush's State of the Union address, one would be hard pressed to guess that one of America's greatest cities and the region around it had been laid to waste only five months earlier. This catastrophe barely merited a mention until the end of an otherwise lengthy speech.\n        Mardi Gras throws the health crisis into sharper relief, but it extends beyond the party season. The return of residents, which has accelerated with the reopening of some schools and universities, has meant more people needing emergency services. State officials should re-evaluate whether parts of the old Charity Hospital can be reopened at least temporarily, as the mayor has requested.\n        It will take years to get the health care system back to what it was, but there are only days until the festival begins on Feb. 18. New Orleans needs a triumphant Mardi Gras, not a dangerous one.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":20,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1654554,"ids":1654554,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"India's Parliament is about to take up a bill that could affect sick people the world over. India is the leading supplier of low-cost generic AIDS medicine. The country's huge generic industry has been able to copy antiretrovirals and other medicines because India grants patents for the process of making drugs, rather than for the medicines themselves. But the Patents Bill that India is considering, at the behest of the World Trade Organization, would change that.\n        Parliament must make sure that it protects India's ability to make these crucial drugs. While the W.T.O. requires its members to respect product patents, it allows them to put public health first. Unfortunately, the Patents Bill would fail to do this; some of its provisions would go far beyond what the trade organization requires. The bill bears the heavy footprint of multinational and Indian pharmaceutical companies that are eager to sell high-priced drugs to India's middle class, which is larger than the population of the United States.\n        Lobbying by these companies has produced a bill that would sacrifice public health. For example, as current AIDS drugs become ineffective, India will be asked to make cheap, easy-to-take combination versions of newer antiretrovirals. To do so as a W.T.O. member, the government will have to issue something called a compulsory license, which allows a generic manufacturer to copy a patented drug. The patent holder gets a reasonable royalty, but does not have to consent. But India's compulsory license process is very slow and lets pharmaceutical companies tie up such licenses in court for years. Moreover, India's laws do not allow it to export medicines made under these rules to countries where they aren't patented, which includes most of Africa.\n        Indian lawmakers must reform the Patents Bill to cut the red tape that can block compulsory licenses. They should also eliminate the loophole that prevents medicines from going to the poorest countries. India needs to allow challenges to patents before they take effect, and to remove a provision that could allow a company to extend a patent by simply finding a new use for a drug.\n        Instead of passing the flawed government bill, lawmakers should refer the bill to a committee for public testimony about possible reforms. Seldom has India's Parliament considered anything of such global import. If Parliament can preserve India's ability to provide generic versions of these medicines, it will make the difference between life and death for millions of people at home and abroad.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1826583,"ids":1826583,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Indonesia sent a chill through the World Health Organization recently when it refused to supply any more samples of the avian flu virus that has killed scores of its people. The move, which seemed aimed at gaining access to vaccines at an affordable price, threatens the global effort to track the virus and develop vaccines. But Indonesia has raised a valid point that needs to be addressed: if a pandemic should strike, poor countries would be left without protection.\n        The W.H.O. relies on a global network of laboratories to provide virus samples so experts can determine which are most likely to spread. These strains are then used to develop the seed stocks that are given -- at no cost -- to manufacturers to use in making vaccines.\n        In a typical flu season, the key strains emerge from Asia, while the vaccines are sold primarily in the West. This has not caused a ruckus because most developing countries consider influenza one of their lesser health threats. But with rising fears of an avian flu pandemic, the dynamic has changed.\n        Indonesia decided to act after a foreign company announced work on a vaccine that would be based on its samples. Indonesia stopped cooperating with the W.H.O. and started negotiations to send future samples to another vaccine maker in return for technology that would allow Indonesia to make its own vaccine.\n        That may be good for Indonesia but could be harmful to global health -- especially if other countries follow. Clearly Indonesia, which is in discussion with W.H.O. officials, needs to rejoin the global network. Unfortunately, the W.H.O. has no good answer to the inequities Indonesia has spotlighted.\n        If a pandemic struck, the current vaccine makers could produce only 500 million doses of vaccine per year if they ran 24 hours a day. That is far short of what would be needed to vaccinate all 6.7 billion people in the world. Thus there seems no doubt that in a crisis, the countries that are home to the vaccine makers would tend to their own citizens first -- or those willing to pay the highest prices -- leaving little or no vaccine for everyone else.\n        The W.H.O. needs to work much harder to encourage the transfer of vaccine production technology to countries, like Indonesia, that have the technical ability to use it. That will increase the supply of vaccine and presumably bring prices down. Even then, we fear, there still won't be enough.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1721722,"ids":1721722,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Industrial accidents do not normally make big international news stories, especially when they happen in China, where coal mine disasters and fatal factory fires are all too common occurrences. China, the world's most dynamic economy, is also, regrettably, one of its least effectively regulated, and it seems to have more than its share of unenlightened and corrupt managers. But when a fatal explosion at a state-owned petrochemical plant spewed a 50-mile-long slick of toxic benzene compounds into a major river, forcing a cutoff of the water supply for nearly a week to a city of several million people, the world paid some overdue attention.\n        People everywhere watched with sympathy as the people of Harbin, a rust-belt metropolis in China's frozen northeast, coped with the challenges of doing without toilets, showers, and cooking and drinking water last weekend. Foreign governments, global health experts and prospective international investors also looked on with keen interest, availing themselves of an unusual chance to see how well China's habitually secretive authorities handled a difficult and unexpected problem. If an avian flu epidemic ever occurs among humans, the world's ability to cope will depend, among other things, on how transparently and effectively Beijing responds to any outbreak within its borders.\n        The initial verdict on the spill and its aftermath is mixed. After an inexcusable and potentially disastrous attempt by the authorities to conceal the nature of the water problem, the Chinese government and local Harbin officials recovered relatively quickly. They organized a well-disciplined response, including trucked-in emergency water supplies, that lessened the hardships of affected city residents.\n        The government might not have recovered so quickly without a rare and very useful push from below. The official cover-up came undone after dead fish began appearing in the Songhua River, and local environmentalists and journalists began sounding alarms. Chinese citizens still have very little opportunity to operate independently of the government, and do so at their own great peril. This episode demonstrates the importance of expanding that independent space as China's economy surges ahead and its environment becomes increasingly stressed.\n        China's packed cities are now among the world's most environmentally degraded, its rivers are among most polluted, and careless land use is expanding deserts and putting urban drinking supplies at grave risk. China has fairly strong antipollution laws, but corrupt local officials continue to accept bribes and look the other way when these rules are bent or openly flouted.\n        Whether that happened at the Jilin plant of the China National Petroleum Corporation, where the initial explosion occurred, should be one of the questions asked by the official investigation that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now promised. An equally important question is why, for almost 10 days, China's government did not think the people of Harbin deserved to share its knowledge of the cancer-causing chemicals that were streaming their way.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1720894,"ids":1720894,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Iraq has been a sobering experience for the United States military. It needs to be an educational one as well. Out of it must come an understanding that there is a lot more to regime change than unleashing the most powerful war-fighting machine in human history for a few weeks against an overmatched third-world army. The indispensable next step is nation-building, a long-term, large-scale project that requires willing allies and a differently trained and configured American military force.\n        It is therefore encouraging to learn that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is now weighing proposals to prepare American forces for this kind of role by elevating what the Pentagon calls ''stability operations'' to a level comparable to traditional combat. That marks a welcome change from a Pentagon leadership that disparaged long-term security and reconstruction tasks as something others could do after American forces moved on.\n        America's combat-oriented military toppled Saddam Hussein with ease. But even before the dictator's statue crashed to the ground in Baghdad, a new and daunting set of security problems emerged -- problems that Pentagon planners had failed to adequately anticipate. With the old regime's forces of order melted away and nothing new organized to replace them, civil order quickly broke down. Public buildings were pillaged, civilians kidnapped for ransom and utility lines stripped.\n        After weeks of such anarchy, signs of an armed insurgency began to emerge. Many Iraqis concluded that the American occupiers were unable to control the country and assure the necessities of daily life. The insurgency might have erupted anyway. But it surely would not have been able to strike roots in such fertile ground.\n        Stability operations are meant to provide the basic day-to-day security that is absolutely essential for physical and political reconstruction to proceed. They use people trained as engineers, civil affairs specialists, foreign language speakers, military and police trainers, and special operations forces to work closely with local populations and to coordinate with foreign service officers and aid agencies.\n        What remains to be seen, of course, is how far Mr. Rumsfeld is willing to go in this direction. It is not at all clear that he will agree to reallocate money and personnel toward foreign language specialists and engineers. Even if he does, the Army's current recruitment troubles will make it difficult to compete with private-sector opportunities. At best, reorienting the military in this direction will take years. There is also the crucially important question of whether new bureaucratic directives from the Pentagon will percolate down to the level of actual military operations.\n        Stability operations are not a panacea. But if used wisely, they can spell the difference between a successful completed mission and an endless quagmire.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1751587,"ids":1751587,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Iraq is becoming a country that America should be ashamed to support, let alone occupy. The nation as a whole is sliding closer to open civil war. In its capital, thugs kidnap and torture innocent civilians with impunity, then murder them for their religious beliefs. The rights of women are evaporating. The head of the government is the ally of a radical anti-American cleric who leads a powerful private militia that is behind much of the sectarian terror.\n        The Bush administration will not acknowledge the desperate situation. But it is, at least, pushing in the right direction, trying to mobilize all possible leverage in a frantic effort to persuade the leading Shiite parties to embrace more inclusive policies and support a broad-based national government.\n        One vital goal is to persuade the Shiites to abort their disastrous nomination of Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari. Mr. Jaafari is unable to form a broadly inclusive government and has made no serious effort to rein in police death squads. Even some Shiite leaders are now calling on him to step aside. If his nomination stands and is confirmed by Parliament, civil war will become much harder to head off. And from the American perspective, the Iraqi government will have become something that no parent should be asked to risk a soldier son or daughter to protect.\n        Unfortunately, after three years of policy blunders in Iraq, Washington may no longer have the political or military capital to prevail. That may be hard for Americans to understand, since it was the United States invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and helped the Shiite majority to power. Some 140,000 American troops remain in Iraq, more than 2,000 American servicemen and servicewomen have died there so far and hundreds of billions of American dollars have been spent.\n        Yet Shiite leaders have responded to Washington's pleas for inclusiveness with bristling hostility, personally vilifying Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and criticizing American military operations in the kind of harsh language previously heard only from Sunni leaders. Meanwhile, Moktada al-Sadr, the radically anti-American cleric and militia leader, has maneuvered himself into the position of kingmaker by providing decisive support for Mr. Jaafari's candidacy to remain prime minister.\n        It was chilling to read Edward Wong's interview with the Iraqi prime minister in The Times last week, during which Mr. Jaafari sat in the palace where he now makes his home, complained about the Americans and predicted that the sectarian militias that are currently terrorizing Iraqi civilians could be incorporated into the army and police. The stories about innocent homeowners and storekeepers who are dragged from their screaming families and killed by those same militias are heartbreaking, as is the thought that the United States, in its hubris, helped bring all this to pass.\n        It is conceivable that the situation can still be turned around. Mr. Khalilzad should not back off. The kind of broadly inclusive government he is trying to bring about offers the only hope that Iraq can make a successful transition from the terrible mess it is in now to the democracy that we all hoped would emerge after Saddam Hussein's downfall. It is also the only way to redeem the blood that has been shed by Americans and Iraqis alike.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1648104,"ids":1648104,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Iraq's historic election left the country with a problem that everyone saw coming but no one took serious steps to try to address. Instead of dealing with the alienation of the Sunni community before the vote, leaders of the Shiite majority, both religious and secular, insisted on holding the election first and working to bring the minority Sunnis -- who mostly stayed away from the polls -- in later.\n        Later has arrived. The Sunni boycott means that the Shiites and the Kurdish parties will be significantly overrepresented in a new government. That carries its own dangers. If either group overplays its already strong hand, the vision of a peaceful, democratic and unified Iraq evoked by the election will quickly shatter. That would poorly repay those voters for their bravery and determination. It would also leave American troops fighting a prolonged, and perhaps unwinnable, counterinsurgency war in the Sunni provinces. The victorious parties must accept that winning back the Sunni provinces is a political challenge they must take on themselves, not a military chore that can be handed off to American troops.\n        There is some hopeful talk coming from Iraqi political leaders of all communities as they float at least tentative ideas about possible cooperation in writing Iraq's new constitution. This talk flows in part from the arithmetic of constitutional ratification. A two-thirds majority vote against the constitution in any 3 of Iraq's 18 provinces could block final approval. That provision was originally designed to protect the three Kurdish-majority provinces. But now it forces attention to the concerns of the three Sunni-Arab-majority provinces as well. Those provinces are certain to be severely underrepresented in the newly elected constitutional assembly.\n        The final allocation of National Assembly seats won't be known for a while. But one certain result is that Iraq's long-oppressed Shiite majority will now wield decisive political power. We hope Iraq's Shiite leaders understand the difference between leadership and dominance, and treat other groups better than they were treated during the long decades of Sunni dictatorship.\n        The slate of Shiite religious parties that almost certainly drew the most votes is unlikely to be able to rule alone, since it will take two-thirds of the new assembly to choose a new government and adopt a new constitution. The coalition partners available to them will include the secular Shiite slate led by the interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi; the bloc formed by the two main Kurdish parties; and a scattering of Sunnis and independents. The wisest course would be to reach out widely, leaving as few groups as possible feeling left out and embittered. In a country experimenting with democracy for the first time, the concept of a loyal opposition hasn't had enough time to take root.\n        For their part, Sunni leaders need to begin making concrete proposals about how their voices and votes can be added to the constitutional debate. Sunnis -- not Shiites, Kurds or the American Embassy -- should be deciding which Sunnis to include and how. Once this happens, Shiites and Kurds should respond generously, recognizing that anything that draws Sunnis away from the insurgency and helps preserve a unified Iraq is in their interests as well.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1783805,"ids":1783805,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Israel is politically roiled by public dissatisfaction with the monthlong Lebanon war.

Given the implacable hatred of its enemies, Israel cannot afford to show weakness. But it is even more important that whatever it does is done successfully. The military campaign failed to achieve its stated objectives despite its heavy toll in Lebanese and Israeli lives. Now Israelis have a right to ask whether Mr. Olmert rashly raised the ante by demanding the military destruction of Hezbollah without having any clear and realistic strategy for achieving such an ambitious aim.\n        Mr. Olmert and Mr. Peretz unwisely accepted the assurances of the military chief of staff, an air force general, that a relatively brief air campaign alone could accomplish the mission. Clearly, it didn't. Yet for weeks, they refused either to suspend the airstrikes or switch to a different approach. The ground offensive they finally ordered came too late to make a real difference.\n        Washington might have helped rescue them from their predicament, but it did not. President Bush still has not learned the difference between supporting Israel and uncritically endorsing the policies of fallible Israeli leaders. That often hurts Israel's larger interests, and America's as well, as it did in this case.\n        There are things Washington can do for Israel that Israel cannot do for itself, like negotiating with Hezbollah's patrons in Damascus and Tehran and mobilizing diplomatic coalitions that can maneuver Hezbollah into concessions that military pressure alone can never achieve. None of this was done, resulting in a fudge of a United Nations resolution that is worth no more than France's so-far absent will to back it up.\n        Washington helps Israel best when it supplements, and where necessary restrains, Israeli actions, not when it acts as a mindless echo chamber. America abdicated leadership in this crisis, leaving Mr. Olmert to deal with the messy outcome.\n        It doesn't help that unlike most of his predecessors, Mr. Olmert does not have a professional military background.

Lawyers would also be limited to three visits with each client, and an inmate would be allowed only a single visit to decide whether to authorize an attorney to handle his case. Interrogators at Guant\u00e1namo Bay have a history of masking their identities, so the rule would make it much harder than it already is to gain the trust of a prisoner.\n        Perhaps the most outrageous of the Justice Department's proposals would allow government officials -- on their own authority -- to deny lawyers access to the evidence used to decide whether an inmate is an illegal enemy combatant. Not even the appalling Military Commissions Act of 2006, rammed through in the last days of the Republican-controlled Congress, goes that far.\n        The filing, with the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., says lawyers have caused unrest among the prisoners and improperly relayed messages to the news media. The administration offered no evidence for these charges, probably because there is none. This is an assault on the integrity of the lawyers, reminiscent of a former Pentagon official's suggestion that they are unpatriotic and that American corporations should boycott their firms.\n        The Justice Department also said lawyers had no right to demand access to clients at Guant\u00e1namo Bay because the clients are ''detained aliens on a secure military base in a foreign country.''\n        The Supreme Court has already rejected that argument, and President Bush can hardly be worried about the sensibilities of Fidel Castro's government. (The camp is on land leased to Washington after the Spanish-American War.)\n        It's obvious why the administration is attacking the lawyers. It does not want the world to know more than it already does about this immoral detention camp.

We understand his disappointment, but he has no right to take his feelings out on the city. Mr. Pataki had 12 years to get this project going, and it is utterly unreasonable of him to do anything that could leave New Yorkers without the hope of replacing the dismal Penn Station for a very long time. Mr. Pataki has no choice but to let a new governor pick up this project.\n        The Moynihan Station has been in the works, often in fits and starts, for all of Mr. Pataki's three terms in office. This week, with his administration nearing an end, the station finally went to the Public Authorities Control Board, where state development projects must get unanimous support from the speaker of the State Assembly, the president of the State Senate and the governor. The lone Democrat, Speaker Sheldon Silver, vetoed the plan.\n        Bringing everything to a halt until his own, sometimes oblique, concerns are satisfied is a familiar posture for Mr. Silver. In this case, he is right in saying the current plan does only part of the work -- renovating a third of the Farley Post Office building into an alternative entrance to Penn Station. It's obvious that a better approach would be to consider the bigger but still mostly unformed proposal that would move Madison Square Garden to the back of the Farley building, renovate the front part of the building, raze the hideous current Garden and redevelop that site to restore the entire Penn Station complex to some of its former glory.\n        The promise of Moynihan Station has been tantalizing for too long. The current Penn Station is an abomination -- underground, harshly lit and graceless. The original building, a stately twin to the post office, was torn down four decades ago. Merely renovating the Farley would not bring back the old glory, nor would it accommodate enough commuter rail traffic. What's needed is a complete solution.\n        Calling the project dead -- as Mr. Pataki's appointee, Charles Gargano, did -- only risks losing $230 million in federal financing for Moynihan Station, and that is unacceptable.

Whites-only deed restrictions and exclusionary zoning rules helped to lay the boundary lines; inertia and human nature have done the rest. The era of overtly discriminatory housing policies may be over, but the unbearable whiteness of certain Long Island communities -- and the brownness of others -- attest to the stubborn endurance of Long Island's original sin.

Lawsuits by Acorn against four local real estate companies charge that black and Hispanic people who asked about renting apartments in white neighborhoods like Garden City were ignored, lied to or urged to go away. According to Acorn, white applicants who called or visited these companies -- Garden City Properties and Anne Hagen's Village Realty in Garden City, Jimco Century 21 in Glen Cove and Bosco Realty in Franklin Square -- enjoyed all the courtesies accorded potential customers, while black and Hispanic applicants were frequently told that apartments were unavailable or that they should look somewhere else.\n        It is hardly surprising that some real estate companies would choose not to fight Long Island's system of functional apartheid but would try to use it to their advantage. Like car salesmen, real estate agents scramble to make a living selling expensive products to wary customers who routinely hire outside specialists to test the veracity of the sales pitches. But the fact that they live in a high-pressure world does not relieve them of their obligation to obey the law, which is clear on matters of fair housing and civil rights.\n        The accusations raised by Acorn, the result of more than a year of effort done in the best tradition of grass-roots advocacy, deserve thorough investigation by state licensing officials, the Division of Human Rights and the attorney general's office.","adu_anecdote":3,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1703657,"ids":1703657,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It has been clear since 2000 that the election system is in serious need of reform.

It favors requiring electronic voting machines to produce paper records, and opposes partisan activity by state election officials. It fails to address other problems, like not counting provisional ballots cast at the wrong precincts.\n        But the bombshell recommendation is for the states to require voters to have drivers' licenses or a government-issued photo ID. That would not be a great burden for people who have drivers' licenses, but it would be for those who don't, and they are disproportionately poor, elderly or members of minorities. These voters would have to get special photo ID's and keep them updated. If they didn't have the ID's, their right to vote would be taken away. The commission recommends that the cards be free. But election administration is notoriously underfinanced, and it is not hard to imagine that states would charge for them. Georgia is already charging $20 and more for each of its state voter cards.\n        There is very little evidence of voters' claiming to be people they are not, and the commission admits that its members are divided about how big a problem it is. But the report goes on to say that even if there is just a small amount of fraud, it should be stopped. True, but if the solution risks disenfranchising hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of voters, it is a very bad reform.\n        There are more reasonable approaches. The states could require uniform ID's, but allow each voter without one to sign an affidavit attesting to his or her identity, a system some states use now.

He said that ''for some, the commission's ID proposal constitutes nothing short of a modern-day poll tax.''\n        The disappointing report made public yesterday was not a complete surprise. There have been red flags waving around the commission for some time; Mr. Baker is remembered by many for his fierce fight to stop the counting of votes in Florida in 2000. There have also been complaints about the commission's process. Spencer Overton, a George Washington University law professor and commission member, complains that he was told he had to limit a dissent on complicated voting issues to just 250 words.\n        The purpose of election reform should not be making it harder to vote. We all have a duty to make our election system as good as it can be -- and not to disenfranchise people in the name of reform.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":6,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1793596,"ids":1793596,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"It has taken five and a half years, but at least some of President Bush's aides have begun to acknowledge the patently obvious: There needs to be a serious effort to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n        Without one, the United States has no chance of salvaging its battered reputation in the Islamic world. No chance of rallying moderate Arab leaders to fight extremists or contain Iran. And no chance of ensuring Israel's lasting security. We just hope that Mr. Bush will now make the long neglected peace effort a central priority for the remaining years of his presidency.\n        With Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice traveling to the region next week, Mr. Bush should give her an explicit mandate to press Israel, and not just the Palestinians, for real compromises. He should also give her the authority to talk to adversaries, and not just friends, about how to support the effort.\n        For years, Mr. Bush's advisers have woven an entire mythology about how Middle East peace required tanks on the road to Baghdad, rather than diplomats on planes to Jerusalem, Ramallah and Damascus.\n        So it was surprising to hear one of Ms. Rice's closest aides, Philip Zelikow, the State Department counselor, tell a think-tank audience that some sense of progress on the Arab-Israeli dispute is ''just a sine qua non'' for getting moderate Arabs and the Europeans to cooperate on Iran and the region's many other dangerous problems. ''We can rail against that belief. We can find it completely justifiable. But it's fact,'' Mr. Zelikow said.\n        We fear that Mr. Bush and his secretary of state haven't yet caught up to that. As Ms. Rice prepared to leave, other aides said that the most she would do would be to rally support for the moderate Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and to solicit ideas on how to revive peace talks.\n        Ms. Rice should use this trip to commit herself to negotiating a comprehensive cease-fire. She can start by telling the Israelis they need to immediately end targeted killings and halt all settlement construction. Ms. Rice needs to make clear to the Palestinians that while words are important, she is less concerned with rhetoric than the ability and willingness of any Palestinian government to halt, rather than abet, all attacks on Israel.\n        Washington is already encouraging Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, to meet with Mr. Abbas, for more symbolic support. Ms. Rice should instead tell all sides that President Bush's goal is a full resumption of peace negotiations -- and that he will commit the full resources of his presidency to the effort.\n        Ms. Rice should be willing to go to Damascus -- or send a top aide -- to tell President Bashar al-Assad that relations can improve if he restrains his clients Hamas and Hezbollah. The Europeans -- who have been desperate for the United States to engage -- should make the same trip to warn of real punishments should he refuse.\n        The lesson of this summer's disastrous wars in Lebanon and Gaza is that the time for listening tours and tactical steps is far past. We hope that Mr. Zelikow's bosses start paying attention.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1758221,"ids":1758221,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It is a great concept: Take the 34,000 or so children in New York who are now in half-day pre-kindergarten classes, and extend their program to a full day. The benefits of expanded early childhood education have been widely affirmed. This is especially true for children from disadvantaged homes who, without early intervention, are most likely to lag behind their classmates in vocabulary and other ways when they begin their regular schooling.\n        The City Council Speaker, Christine Quinn, wants to spend nearly $300 million in city money to extend prekindergarten hours over the next three years. Mayor Michael Bloomberg agrees on the need for more and better preschool programs and has spoken eloquently about it; indeed, he has made it a centerpiece of his fight to get the state to cough up the billions of dollars in education money it owes the city. But the money is tied up in court and there's no telling when it will appear.\n        Mr. Bloomberg is justified in asking the state to pay for universal prekindergarten. For starters, Gov. George Pataki promised to pay for such a program in a deal he struck with State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver in 1997. The state sends the city about $150 million a year for prekindergarten programs, but that is not enough to underwrite full-day sessions.\n        Children now spend only two and a half hours in the program. That forces their working parents to find day care for the afternoon, with the result that many do not register their children. This in turn leads to inefficiencies; at the end of the year, the city winds up spending less than it could have simply because there were not enough children to fill the available places. Such waste has recurring ramifications. Children in pre-kindergarten are less likely to repeat grades or need special assistance. They drop out less often. It costs less in the long run -- far less -- to begin to educate these children when they are three and four years old.\n        Last month, Mr. Bloomberg played a high-stakes game of chicken with Albany when he threatened to stop school construction in the districts of key legislators. The chastened lawmakers eventually approved more than $11 billion to build city schools.\n        But that's just part of the obligation the state incurred in a lawsuit brought by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity. Albany still owes the city operating funds amounting to as much as $5.6 billion in the next four years.\n        Mr. Bloomberg plans to use some of that money for preschool and has called for doubling the number of enrolled children. But because the money may be slow in arriving, Ms. Quinn wants to make changes right away, working with communities to find space to accommodate full-day sessions while the city spends some of its capital windfall to increase preschool space.\n        The city should not have to go it alone on something that should be a state obligation. But a stand on principle may be less important than not wasting another minute to educate at-risk children at the earliest opportunity.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1772322,"ids":1772322,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"It is a measure of how far Washington has scaled down its expectations on Iraq that this week's most encouraging news consisted of some highly tentative feelers for direct talks between the armed Shiite parties that dominate Iraq's government and some of the armed Sunni insurgent groups that have been fighting it.\n        Don't get us wrong. We, too, are encouraged that Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has announced a promising, though not fully spelled out, national reconciliation program aimed at attracting wider support from the restive Sunni Arab minority. We are even more encouraged that several Sunni insurgent groups have reportedly approached the government with the idea of beginning negotiations.\n        If these approaches lead to successful talks with important elements of the insurgency, it would be a crucial breakthrough. Productive negotiations could help transform the newly formed Maliki cabinet into a true government of national unity, not just a symbolic parceling out of cabinet jobs among Shiite, Kurdish and Sunni politicians.\n        An agreement with major insurgent groups would also be an important step toward eventually enabling the Iraqi government to stand on its own, without having to rely indefinitely on tens of thousands of American troops to hold down the Sunni western provinces. Such an agreement could stabilize some areas enough to allow the kind of infrastructure repair and economic reconstruction that could generate genuine support from ordinary Iraqis.\n        Nobody should underestimate the obstacles. But if Mr. Maliki is prepared to be a strong national leader, rather than a captive of the Shiite parties that put him in power, there is a chance that they can be overcome.\n        One big issue is amnesty. Insurgent groups are unlikely to agree to lay down their arms without some assurances of amnesty for their fighters. Yet the Iraqi government talks about denying amnesty to insurgents who have killed other Iraqis, and Washington has insisted on excluding those who have killed Americans. That is understandable on both counts, but it would seem to leave few, if any, real insurgents eligible for any amnesty.\n        There is also the question of dropping employment restrictions and other penalties against all but the highest echelons of former Baath Party members -- those with direct responsibility for the major crimes of the Saddam Hussein era. For most of the rest, party membership was often a condition for employment, promotion and, in some cases, survival. But many Shiites and Kurds, who suffered systematic discrimination under Baath rule, want to penalize even lower-level Baathists.\n        Any reconciliation broad enough to matter will require embracing unsavory people and forgiving unsavory deeds. That won't be pretty or popular. But it is Iraq's best remaining hope for peace, reconstruction and national survival.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1707132,"ids":1707132,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It is a sign of the times that President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court was greeted with so many sighs of relief. Ms. Miers's record is so thin that no one seems to have any idea of what she believes, and she was clearly chosen because of her close ties to the president, not her legal qualifications. Still, there is no evidence as yet that she is an ideological warrior who would attempt to return American jurisprudence to the 18th century, and these days, the nation seems to be setting the bar for almost everything pretty low.\n        Ms. Miers's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 gives at least some reason to hope that she could be a moderate, pragmatic judge in the mold of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, whose seat she will fill if she is confirmed. She has spent much of her career in corporate law firms and bar associations, environments that encourage pragmatism over ideology.\n        The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, Senator Charles Schumer of New York and other Senate Democrats made it clear that an extremist nominee would face a tough confirmation battle, and they may have helped convince Mr. Bush not to nominate a judge or law professor with a long record of opposing privacy rights, civil rights and other freedoms. But choosing Ms. Miers, a member of his team who was also his own personal lawyer, is still very much in character with the president's tendency to reward familiarity and loyalty over independence and a reputation for excellence.\n        The American people are certainly entitled to know a lot more about Ms. Miers. As a non-judge who has largely operated behind the scenes, she does not have a lengthy record of judicial opinions, law review articles and public comments. While this page complained about the lack of information available about John Roberts, the new chief justice was a veritable font of background records compared with this new nominee.\n        This administration likes to argue that Ruth Bader Ginsburg declined to say much about her views when she was nominated. But she had been a federal appeals court judge for more than a decade, and her approach to judging was well known. The Senate needs to ask Ms. Miers directly where she stands on important legal issues, and it should not confirm her unless she makes clear her commitment to well-settled rights that Americans take for granted.\n        Ms. Miers's nomination is a sign of just how politicized judicial selection has become. The normal model for a Supreme Court nominee is a judge, usually from a federal appeals court, who has served long enough to develop and demonstrate judicial excellence. But today, anyone who meets that standard runs into a political Catch-22. The far right of the Republican Party will oppose anyone who has shown signs of moderation, and Senate Democrats will try to block anyone who has not. Rather than select a strongly qualified candidate from the legal mainstream, President Bush has taken the easy way out by choosing a less accomplished nominee who will raise fewer political problems.\n        Many of the best justices have taken odd routes to the court. Ms. Miers could prove to be a pragmatic, common-sense justice who ends up making this court the Miers Court, the way Justice O'Connor effectively made the last one the O'Connor Court. Before taking that risk, however, the Senate needs to get to work to learn a lot more about her.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1660083,"ids":1660083,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It is a wonder that more people do not want to be New York State legislators.

But some Democratic leaders were alarmed that a vote to eliminate capital punishment might be construed as being soft on crime, so they surprised almost everyone by assigning the measure to the Senate's budget committee.\n        And the budget committee, as one senator said, is ''where bills go to die.''\n        The momentum to repeal capital punishment stems from a 13-member legislative committee's courageous recommendation last winter that New Jersey become the first state to abolish the death penalty since states began re-enacting it in the mid-1970s. The panel, which proposed replacing execution with life imprisonment without parole, included two prosecutors, a police chief, members of the clergy, and a man whose daughter was murdered in 2000.\n        Only one member, a former state senator who wrote the state's death penalty law, dissented. As the committee said at the time, capital punishment ''is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency.''\n        It is also a barbaric relic of an earlier day and, it should be noted, a poor deterrent to crime, and it deserves no role in a civilized society. By retaining a death penalty, a state places itself in the company of nations such as North Korea, Iran and China that are notorious for their inhumane treatment. With the use of DNA in recent years, it has become increasingly clear that capital punishment poses too great a risk of irreversible error.\n        In its report, the legislative committee said that ending the death penalty, which has not been enforced in New Jersey since 1963, would actually save money since the state would no longer have to go through expensive and drawn out litigation and appeals. It was that suggestion of a budgetary impact that gave Democratic leaders the excuse they were looking for to pass off and sidetrack the bill.\n        In the interest of simple forthrightness -- and a little courage -- we urge New Jersey's lawmakers to reconsider this dodge and allow the bill to be voted on by the full Senate.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1726107,"ids":1726107,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It is cheering to see that New Orleans has not been completely forgotten. The White House's request for an additional $1.5 billion for hurricane protection demonstrates that the city's fate has not slipped entirely off the agenda in Washington. As a result, residents hoping to return to their homes in time for Christmas can think about rebuilding with a little more confidence than before.\n        Most important of all, it ought to remove from the table for good the question of whether we should or would rebuild the city. We must rebuild it -- or to be more precise, give New Orleans the ability to rebuild itself. The administration has indicated it will stand by President Bush's pledge to do so. The issue now is not whether to do it, but how to do it right.\n        As a first step, the White House request is a good one. But if this is the entire plan to protect greater New Orleans, it is woefully insufficient. It may protect against a storm of Katrina's size, but probably not a more ferocious one. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana probably put it best when she called it a ''down payment.''\n        The president's absence at the announcement is also duly noted. He needs to step up personally and more forcefully to ensure that New Orleans receives the support he has promised it. And even this interim victory can't be declared too soon -- Congress still needs to act on his proposal and the larger aid package of which it would be a part.\n        The president had previously committed $1.6 billion to repair the levees and the floodwalls that failed during Hurricane Katrina, patching and restoring them to their strength before the monster storm hit. The additional money would be used to reinforce the levees where they are vulnerable with concrete and rock. It would pay for new pumping stations to get the water out of the city. Several canals that carried the massive storm surge would be closed off, most likely with gates.\n        On the day of the announcement, the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, stood next to Mr. Bush's Hurricane Katrina reconstruction czar, Donald Powell, and praised the plan. He said that the city had a commitment and financing for hurricane protection beyond what it had ever had before. Mr. Nagin said, ''I want to say to all New Orleanians, to all businesses, 'It's time for you to come home.' ''\n        We owe it to those who heed the mayor's call to raise the system's strength until it can endure a Category 5 storm. That means more than just bracing existing walls. It means restoring the vanishing natural defenses of the wetlands, which need to be a significant share of any comprehensive plan. That alone will cost billions, but current proposals include just $250 million.\n        We can greet the new commitment warmly while still marveling that the city and the state had to beg and wait for what amounts to a rounding error in the federal budget.

A brief anthrax scare at two Pentagon mail centers in recent days has turned out, fortunately, to be a false alarm. But the Pentagon's response to the presumed assault is anything but reassuring.\n        This Keystone Kops episode started last Thursday, when swabs were routinely taken from air filters and machinery at a mail site next to the Pentagon by an outside laboratory that has been hired to test such samples daily. Four days later, the small Virginia company finally reported that it had identified anthrax spores in its Thursday swabbings. The sample was sent to the Army's crack biodefense laboratory at Fort Detrick, Md., which concurred in the identification of anthrax.\n        Meanwhile, apparently by coincidence, an alarm went off Monday at another Pentagon mail center in an office complex a few miles away, triggering a shutdown there and at a civilian postal center that forwards Pentagon mail in Washington. Hundreds of people were started on a course of antibiotics before extensive follow-up tests of material and people from the mail sites found no anthrax.\n        The best guess now is that the first laboratory might have inadvertently contaminated samples with the strain of anthrax it keeps on hand as a reference and then sent the material on to Fort Detrick, which, of course, confirmed the contamination.\n        Although the precise details of this mix-up remain murky, there is cause for concern. For starters, the four-day time lag between collecting the samples at the mail center and declaring them contaminated with anthrax is an appallingly lax response by the laboratory. Had this been a real anthrax attack, we might be counting the victims. The Pentagon plays down the danger by noting that all inbound mail is first irradiated away from the site, so any spores detected at the Pentagon would presumably have been dead and unable to infect people. But the irradiation system is surely not foolproof, and the swabs are tested to reduce any remaining danger.\n        In theory, the mail is supposed to be impounded until tests show it is safe. But in this case, some 8,000 pieces of mail were sent to redistribution points within the Pentagon before the seemingly positive tests for anthrax forced a scramble to retrieve them. Pentagon mail handlers have apparently gotten so used to assuming that the tests will be negative that they didn't bother to wait for the results.\n        A second concern is a possible breakdown in community-notification procedures. The Pentagon insists that it notified key federal agencies and a local emergency responder network shortly after it learned on Monday that anthrax might have been detected. But officials in Fairfax County, Va., have complained that they didn't learn of the first anthrax report at the Pentagon until hours after the fact. Some high federal officials have muttered on background that the Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services Departments were not galvanized quickly.

Consider Charles Stimson, the deputy assistant secretary of state for detainee affairs, who has been trying to spin his way out of his loathsome attempt to punish lawyers who represent inmates of the Guant\u00e1namo Bay internment camp.\n        Last week, Mr. Stimson expressed his ''shock'' that major American law firms would represent terrorism suspects, hinted that they were paid by unsavory characters and suggested that companies should reconsider doing business with them. On Wednesday, Mr. Stimson said he apologized and regretted that his comments ''left the impression'' that he was attacking the integrity of those lawyers.\n        It was not just an impression. It was exactly what he did. Mr. Stimson actually read out a list of law firms during an interview with a radio station friendly to the Bush administration.\n        Mr. Stimson clearly had no regard for his position as a public official who helps set policy on the detainees, never mind the small matter of people's basic right to representation. He connected the detainees to the 9\/11 attacks, even though he certainly knows that the very few detainees who have a connection to 9\/11 don't have legal representation.\n        President Bush and Defense Secretary Robert Gates should have fired him. Their silence was deafening, although hardly surprising given the administration's record of trampling on people's rights in the name of fighting terror. But Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was not silent. In an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Gonzales actually expanded the attack on lawyers, claiming that it has taken as long as five years to bring detainees to trial because of delays caused by their lawyers.\n        There's no truth to that. The cause of the delay in bringing any Guant\u00e1namo detainee to trial is Mr. Bush himself. He refused to hold trials at first, then refused to work with Congress on the issue and claimed the power to devise his own slanted court system. Mr. Bush went to Congress only when the Supreme Court struck those courts down. The result was a bill establishing military tribunals for detainees that is a mockery of American justice.\n        Mr. Stimson's appalling behavior should not be overlooked by the relevant bar disciplinary committee. Existing rules for lawyers deem it professional misconduct to do things that are prejudicial to the administration of justice. Even if the administration does not, the legal profession imposes a higher duty on those holding public office to obey proper standards of behavior.\n        Editorial\n        Correction:  January 23, 2007, Tuesday  In last Friday's editorial about the administration official who urged corporations to punish lawyers for representing Guant\u00e1namo detainees: Charles Stimson is a deputy assistant secretary of defense, not state.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1719368,"ids":1719368,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It is hard to think of a more dangerous situation in Iraq right now than to have disenchanted Sunni Arabs believe that the police forces are in the control of Shiite gunmen who can detain and torture Sunnis at will. So the Bush administration made a good start by insisting on an immediate investigation of all Iraqi detention centers after the discovery of what looked like a Shiite militia-run torture chamber in the heart of Baghdad.\n        Doing that meant brushing aside objections by the Interior Ministry, run by a powerful Shiite leader, and putting a scratch in the thin veneer of Iraqi self-governance. But it is vital to show support for ordinary, law-abiding Sunnis. That vulnerable community has seen enough of its human and political rights trampled by elements of the ruling Shiite coalition. Unless the administration ensures that those rights are fully respected, neither the Dec. 15 elections nor the constitutional revisions that are supposed to follow have much chance of creating any semblance of a unified, democratic Iraq.\n        Still, it's painful to think of how much easier this would all be if it were not for America's tarnished reputation when it comes to torture. It would be much easier for the Bush administration to counter calls by Sunnis and others outside Iraq for an international investigation. It's deeply distressing (although by now, sadly, not surprising) that the Bush administration remains oblivious to its own failures in this area, and to how much of the moral high ground the United States government lost by refusing to deal honestly with the abuse of prisoners by American forces.\n        There was a distinctly hollow ring to last week's talk by American officials of a zero-tolerance policy on the abuse of detainees in Iraqi-run prisons. Back at the ranch, Vice President Dick Cheney is still trying to legalize torture at C.I.A. prisons around the world; President Bush is still threatening to veto the entire Pentagon budget if Congress dares to impose actual rules on the handling of prisoners at military detention camps; and the officials behind the policies that led straight from the doctrine of legalized torture to the horrors of Abu Ghraib continue to be promoted, instead of being held accountable.\n        It took just a few days for the United States to demand a full investigation of Iraqi prisons. Washington immediately recognized that the Iraqi government could not investigate itself alone and assigned the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to help. This same administration, however, has spent the last 18 months obstructing the Senate's inquiries into Abu Ghraib and other aspects of the prison abuse mess, and has used the Republican leadership in Congress to block any outside investigations. It has narrowed the scope of its own inquiries to shield the civilian and military leadership.\n        We're happy the administration pressed for a full accounting of abuse of Iraqis by Iraqis.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority knows this and is bursting with proposals, from connecting the railroad to the East Side of Manhattan to electrifying the rails farther into Suffolk County.\n        The most ambitious of these plans have lain fallow for years, hobbled by fragile finances and deficits of political will. Riders have thus become used to living with old, unkept promises and seeing only intermittent improvements on a railroad that, after all, has a hard enough time making incremental fixes to nagging problems, like closing those annoying and dangerous gaps between tracks and platforms.\n        The authority and the railroad are not the only participants in this slow dance of inertia. Shortsighted local opposition, abetted by timid politicians, has been equally effective in torpedoing progress. A case in point is the groundswell of opposition to the railroad's plan to add a third track in western Nassau County as part of its Main Line Corridor Improvements Project.\n        The wisdom of adding rail capacity between Jamaica and Hicksville is hardly debatable. More trains would ease a chronic bottleneck, especially at rush hour, and allow for greater reverse commuting, which would be a valuable spur to economic growth. The project would also remove a perennial danger: the grade-level crossings that imperil pedestrians, tie up local streets and inevitably fail in winter storms and other inopportune times.\n        But with dismal predictability, a cluster of local residents and business owners has raised a ruckus at the idea of more trains in their backyards. The possibility of eminent-domain proceedings has people sharpening their pitchforks in New Hyde Park and other places. The battle has become a hot issue in the maniacally intense race for an open State Senate seat, which will be decided on Tuesday.\n        The Republican candidate, Maureen O'Connell, has taken an adamantly Nimby stance against the third track, and accuses her opponent, the Democrat Craig Johnson, of being on the wrong side of the issue. But she's wrong -- Mr. Johnson, to his discredit, is on the barricades with her.\n        Whoever wins the Senate election on Tuesday would do well to abandon his or her sour parochialism and work with the authority and the railroad to foster an enlightened process that engages the public and promises fair treatment for anyone who loses property or is otherwise harmed by expanded rail service. The railroad is a critical artery that is neglected and frayed.

The deaths and abuse of children ostensibly under the agency's supervision prompted calls for drastic reform and inspired a lawsuit threatening a federal takeover of the state's child welfare system.\n        Gov. Jon Corzine's plan to create a cabinet-level child-welfare agency independent of the State Department of Human Services may achieve the accountability and performance that have been so sadly lacking. But accountability and performance are not cheap.\n        Mr. Corzine's commissioner for human services, Kevin Ryan, recently pleaded with skeptical lawmakers to approve an extra $52 million in new spending, for a total of $1.4 billion, on child welfare services. With the state facing a $4.5 billion deficit, lawmakers are bound to regard any substantial spending increase with narrowed eyes. What's more, the state has spent $320 million over the last three years to finance reforms in child welfare, only to have abuse and neglect in the foster-care system increase.\n        Nevertheless, the additional funding and the new agency are steps in the right direction. The old model does not work. The new model may have a chance, if it has leadership and resources. In Mr. Ryan, a renowned expert in child welfare, leadership seems to be a given. Mr. Ryan was the state's child advocate -- an independent monitor of the Division of Youth and Family Services -- before becoming human services commissioner, and he will head a new Department of Children and Families when it formally replaces the agency.\n        So the question now is about resources. If Mr. Ryan is going to succeed where others have failed, he will need the additional funding for an array of specific needs, from redeployment of personnel to improved maintenance of the cars caseworkers use for their daily rounds. (Mr. Ryan recently told legislators that 40 percent of the agency's fleet was in the shop.)\n        Legislators may grumble about the increased costs, but what of the increased workload? The number of children placed in foster care in New Jersey has risen from 4,747 in 1998 to 7,167 in 2004, according to the Virginia-based National Coalition for Child Protection Reform.\n        Reform is not only costly, but also time consuming. For example, Alabama's child welfare system has emerged as a national model -- but reform has taken more than a decade of lawsuits, court mandates and false starts. In New Jersey, child welfare was underfunded until scandals and outrage forced the state to acknowledge its failure to protect some of its most vulnerable residents.\n        Now is not the time to pull back on reform.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1831162,"ids":1831162,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It is impossible not to feel fury at the shameful neglect of wounded soldiers at Walter Reed's outpatient facilities, just a few miles from an oblivious and neglectful White House. Many have been housed in rooms coated with mold and infested with cockroaches and mice. They have been swamped with confusing paperwork and forced to take responsibility for managing their own medical care. And when they or their family members have complained, their pleas for help have been callously ignored.\n        In a desperate scramble to mute public outrage, President Bush yesterday named two political veterans to lead a commission charged with investigating conditions throughout the entire system of military and veterans' hospitals. The choices seem to be good ones: Bob Dole, a veteran wounded in World War II and a former Republican Party candidate for president, and Donna Shalala, who ran the Health and Human Services Department for President Bill Clinton.\n        There is plenty of blame to go around. Officials at Walter Reed were egregiously negligent. The Army's high command, and the Joint Chiefs above them, were too weak-kneed or obtuse to demand adequate resources for medical care -- just as they were too fearful for their own careers to demand adequate troops to fight the Iraq war to begin with.\n        But the fundamental responsibility rests with the president and his former defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, who stubbornly insisted on going to war without sufficient resources -- and then sought to hide the costs of their disastrous mistakes from the American public.\n        Is it any surprise that the war's wounded have been hidden away in the shadows of moldy buildings by an administration that refused to let photographers take pictures of returning coffins? Or a White House that keeps claiming that victory in this failed and ever more costly war is always just a few more months away?\n        The Walter Reed revelations once again put the lie to the president's claim that everything is being done to support America's troops. Just as the administration has been shockingly slow to provide the necessary body armor for troops in Iraq and notably complacent about rotating exhausted troops back into the war, so, too, has it been reluctant to confront the large casualty toll from Iraq and Afghanistan. Military doctors have been amazingly proficient about saving lives that would have been lost in earlier wars. But as we now know, the injured survivors too often fall through the cracks.\n        The new commission's investigation, supplemented by the military's own inquiries and by oversight hearings in Congress, must explore all aspects of this scandal. The revelations have flushed out disturbing complaints about shoddy treatment throughout the military and the veterans' medical system and about a hostile process for determining disability benefits. None of this can be tolerated. The soldiers who have sacrificed their health and limbs to a misguided and mismanaged war deserve the best possible care when they return -- for a lifetime, if necessary. And the president needs to learn that the horrors of this war can no longer be denied or hidden away.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1682081,"ids":1682081,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It is nice that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his team feel as if they have achieved closure on their prisoner abuse issues and are ready to move on. The problem is, they are still in deep denial. The Bush administration has not only refused to face the problem squarely, but it is also enabling a pervasive lack of accountability.\n        The most recent evidence of this sad state of affairs came this week in an article in The Times by Eric Schmitt and Thom Shanker, who reported that the Pentagon believes the Abu Ghraib scandal has receded enough in the public's mind that Mr. Rumsfeld is considering a promotion for Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, who was commander of American forces in Iraq at the time of the disaster.\n        We can see why General Sanchez would expect a promotion; Mr. Bush has rewarded the people who drafted the policies that led to the illegal detention, abuse, humiliation and, ultimately, torture and even killing of prisoners at the hands of American military forces. A couple were nominated to the federal appeals court. One became attorney general. Mr. Rumsfeld still has his job.\n        And we feel General Sanchez's pain. As the Army's own investigation showed, he lacked the experience to command the forces in Iraq. Once given that job, he labored under Mr. Rumsfeld's obsession for waging war with too few troops inadequately equipped. For months, Mr. Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld were pretending the war was over, while General Sanchez faced a mushrooming insurgency. He ordered his soldiers to start getting tough with prisoners to get intelligence.\n        General Sanchez relied on established practice in Mr. Bush's military. He set aside American notions of decency and the Geneva Conventions, authorizing harsh interrogations -- including forcing prisoners into painful positions for long periods, isolating them, depriving them of sleep and using guard dogs to, as he put it, ''exploit Arab fears.'' These practices would have been controversial for captives with information that would save Americans' lives. But the vast majority of Abu Ghraib inmates knew nothing.\n        General Sanchez was exonerated by the last in a series of investigations meant to keep the heat off top generals and civilian policy makers. But his own words at the Texas A&amp;M University commencement were damning. When conditions are at their worst, General Sanchez said, ''That is when a leader must step forward and lead -- our ethics mandate it and our subordinates expect it.''\n        General Sanchez failed to do that. He should not be the only senior person to pay the price for failure, but neither should he be the latest to be rewarded for it.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":4,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1843649,"ids":1843649,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"It is no secret that some of the richest candidates are some of the most successful.

Yet that is what now seems to have come from a once-promising bipartisan effort to finally have the debate about the Iraq war that Americans have been denied for four years.\n        The Democrats' ultimate goal was to express the Senate's opposition to President Bush's latest escalation. But the Democrats' leaders have made that more difficult -- allowing the Republicans to maneuver them into the embarrassing position of blocking a vote on a counterproposal that they feared too many Democrats might vote for.\n        We oppose that resolution, which is essentially a promise never to cut off funds for this or any future military operation Mr. Bush might undertake in Iraq. But the right way for the Senate to debate Iraq is to debate Iraq, not to bar proposals from the floor because they might be passed. The majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, needs to call a timeout and regroup. By changing the issue from Iraq to partisan parliamentary tactics, his leadership team threatens to muddy the message of any anti-escalation resolution the Senate may eventually pass.\n        As it happens, the blocked Republican alternative, proposed by Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, itself represents an end run around the Senate's constitutional responsibilities. The rational way to oppose cuts in funds is to vote against them, if and when any ever come before the Senate. Mr. Reid should not be shy about urging fellow Democrats to vote against this hollow gimmick, which tries to make it look as if the senators support Mr. Bush's failed Iraq policies by playing on their fears of being accused of not supporting the troops.\n        America went to war without nearly enough public discussion, and it needs more Senate debate about Iraq this time around, not less. The voters who overturned Republican majorities in both houses last November expect, among other things, to see energized Congressional scrutiny of the entire war -- not just of the plan for an additional 21,500 troops but also of the future of the 130,000 plus who are already there.\n        Another Republican resolution, proposed by Senator John McCain, gives the appearance of moving in that more promising direction by ticking off a series of policy benchmarks and then urging the Iraqi government to meet them. But listing benchmarks is one thing. It is another to spell out real consequences for not meeting them, like the withdrawal of American military support. Instead of doing that, the McCain resolution hands an unwarranted blank check to Mr. Bush's new Iraq commander, Lt. Gen. David Petraeus.

These should require the hard steps toward national reconciliation that the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, continues to evade and that the White House refuses to insist on.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1674881,"ids":1674881,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It is perhaps understandable that the new designs for a cultural center at the former World Trade Center site are being treated with some wariness.

Indeed, no sooner had the long-awaited report, bearing the stamp of the Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, hit the street this week than some economists took shots. ''Utopian central planning by global bureaucrats,'' carped one.\n        There is certainly much to debate about the details of Mr. Sachs's report, which calls for rich countries like the United States to drastically increase foreign aid to poor countries in an effort to halve poverty in its many forms -- hunger, illiteracy, disease -- by 2015. But this is not a time for armchair quarterbacking. The United Nations report is a bold initiative that refuses to accept hunger as the inevitable fate of so many Africans, Latin Americans and Asians. There will be and should be a debate about it as world leaders prepare to meet in September on the antipoverty goals, but it is vital that it not turn into another excuse for inaction.\n        Mr. Sachs's report lays out, in real terms, the myriad ways to help poor people. The beauty of his ideas is in their simplicity: Provide mosquito nets for children who live in malaria-infested regions. Eliminate school and uniform fees to ensure that poor children don't stay home because they can't afford to go to school. Provide farmers in sub-Saharan Africa with soil nutrients to ensure healthier crops. Reform and enforce legislation guaranteeing women and girls property and inheritance rights.\n        None of this is rocket science, although many will try to make it seem so. The strongest, and probably most legitimate, critique of approaches that flood poor countries with money is that many of these poor countries are run by corrupt governments that will stash most of the donor money in private Swiss bank accounts. That has certainly proved true in the past, particularly in Africa, where the poor have stayed poor while a succession of despots have run country after country into the ground.\n        But it is counterproductive to make poor people suffer because they have bad governments. Mr. Sachs says now is the time to try the radically different approach of giving bigger amounts of real, quality aid directly to recipients on the ground. That means money to clinics and schools, to build generators and buy medicine and food, instead of the usual low-interest loans to benefit companies back home.\n        The United Nations proposal calls for rich countries to increase their foreign aid to 0.7 percent of G.D.P. by 2015. That's a target that these very same rich countries, flush with good will at the start of the new millennium, set for themselves. In 2002, world leaders, including President Bush, supported a declaration promising to ''make concrete efforts'' toward the 0.7 percent target.\n        Three years later, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are already there. The United States remains far behind, at 15 hundredths of 1 percent. So, let's get started, America. The world is waiting.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1814864,"ids":1814864,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It is tempting to wink at Ethiopia's stunningly successful offensive in Somalia. It pushed back a hateful Islamic militia that was defying the United Nations, threatening to impose religious tyranny and, according to Washington, harboring international terrorists. The Bush administration quickly succumbed to temptation, lauding Ethiopia's attacks as a legitimate response to ''aggression.''\n        But if there's anything we should have learned over the past few sad years, it is that this kind of unilateral pre-emptive attack seldom solves anything, particularly when the country doing the invading is regarded as a longstanding enemy.\n        Somalia is a familiar kind of mess, with a weak official transitional government composed of a collection of regional clan leaders and warlords, pitted against radical Islamists who control their own militias, who have spread Taliban-like terror among the populace and who recently surrounded the seat of the transitional government at Baidoa.\n        To halt their advance, Ethiopia's armed forces crossed an international border and routed the Islamists, who retreated to their stronghold, Mogadishu, and have largely disappeared from public view.\n        It's hardly surprising that there was little international outcry. But while moderate forces in Somalia have been appalled by the brutal intolerance of Islamist leaders who have threatened to behead people for not praying five times a day, they are unlikely to embrace Ethiopian soldiers as a good alternative. Ethiopia and Somalia have long been rivals, and went to war in the late 1970s over a land dispute. If the transitional government seems propped up by foreign invaders, it would lose whatever popular support it has now.\n        The United States squandered its influence in Somalia by supporting some particularly horrible warlords to challenge the Islamist radicals. But it still has considerable sway over Ethiopia.\n        Washington should use that influence to push for a swift cessation of hostilities, lest the conflict pull in neighboring countries and explode over the entire region. The resulting chaos would create a refugee crisis and open a new terrorist recruiting hub. The Islamists have threatened suicide attacks and called for help from foreign fighters in a ''holy war'' that has already drawn thousands of Muslim fighters from Eritrea, Yemen, Libya and Syria.\n        The United Nations is unhappy about the Ethiopian incursion, but it needs to demonstrate that it has a good alternative. The Security Council must meet urgently to find ways to replace Ethiopian troops with a neutral international force and keep the violence from spreading to other countries.\n        Rather than trying to marginalize the Islamic militias and the huge clan they represent, the international community should try to harness this moment to push for unity talks while the Islamists are weak and the transitional government has attained a more equal standing.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1799250,"ids":1799250,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It is time to make a serious effort to save the vanishing wetlands and barrier islands along the coast of Louisiana. The best chance is a bill passed by the Senate that would guarantee Louisiana and three other coastal states a share of oil and gas revenues from drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. The states would be expected to use the proceeds largely for coastal restoration and related projects. The House should adopt this measure in its present form during the coming lame-duck session, and President Bush should sign it.\n        Since the deluge of Hurricane Katrina anniversary coverage in August, there has been very little talk about the safety of New Orleans and the surrounding region. In fact, the city and the region are more vulnerable than ever.\n        Even before last year's storms, the wetlands and barrier islands that provide a protective buffer were eroding at a rate of 25 square miles a year -- the result of a half-century of calamitous mismanagement of Mississippi River water flows. Katrina and Rita together snatched away another 217 square miles. Levees, of course, are necessary to protect New Orleans and other low-lying areas, but they are only the final line of defense. Healthy wetlands are essential to any long-term plan.\n        The Senate bill -- whose principal architect is Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat -- would open up 8.3 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico to new oil and gas development. Half the royalties would go to the federal treasury, 37.5 percent would go to the four coastal states, and the rest would go into a fund to help other states purchase open space.\n        Our support for this bill should not be taken as a blanket endorsement of offshore drilling -- nor as an endorsement of a mischievous bill sponsored by Representative Richard Pombo, Republican of California, and passed by the House last summer. The Pombo bill would end a longstanding federal moratorium on oil and gas drilling on the entire American coastline. The Landrieu bill would simply enlarge the drilling area in the gulf, where oil and gas exploration has been broadly accepted for years.\n        Mr. Pombo is hoping that the Senate will agree to a conference committee in which the two bills can be married. But his bill is so poorly thought out as to be unacceptable, even as a starting point for compromise. A conference committee would also leave the protection of America's coastal waters to the mercy of closed-door horse trading.\n        Ms. Landrieu opposes any such compromise and so, to his credit, does the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist. They are hoping to persuade the House to accept and approve Ms. Landrieu's narrower bill before the present Congress comes to an end.\n        Is this an impossible objective?\n        Not if sensible people in the House think carefully about it. The Landrieu bill targets an immediate need. The House should not see it as a rival to Mr. Pombo's bill -- which has no chance of passing the Senate -- or, for that matter, as primarily an energy bill. The House should instead see it as a way to restore the health of a battered ecosystem, as future protection for the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, and as a way to deliver on unfulfilled promises.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1806814,"ids":1806814,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It is too early to know who ordered this week's assassination of the Lebanese cabinet minister Pierre Gemayel, but there are many reasons to suspect Syria. Mr. Gemayel opposed Syria's unrelenting campaign to dominate Lebanon's fragile democracy. If the cabinet now loses even one more minister, through intimidation or worse, Lebanon's pro-Western government will collapse -- a collapse that Hezbollah, Syria's ally and henchman, has been publicly seeking.\n        In a Middle East plagued by constant tragedy and defeat, Lebanon's Cedar Revolution and the ousting of Syrian troops last year was a rare and precious victory. The United States and the international community must now rally to support Prime Minister Fouad Siniora -- with cash, security advisers, and anything that might help him and his government survive.\n        Damascus must also be told that it will pay a high price -- in scorn, isolation and sanctions -- if it is found to have ordered Mr. Gemayel's death, or the deaths or maiming of a half-dozen other anti-Syrian politicians and journalists. Hezbollah must be told that it will be shunned if it tries to grab power through further violence or intimidation.\n        The United Nations took an important step this week, approving the creation of a tribunal to prosecute the killers of Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister. The only question there is which top Syrian official gave the order.\n        This page believes that the United States needs to begin a dialogue with Syria, about Iraq and regional peace. But President Bashar al-Assad needs to understand that neither the tribunal nor Lebanon's independence will ever be on the bargaining table. Europe, Russia and all of Syria's neighbors need to join Washington in delivering that message.\n        Hezbollah has been insisting on veto power over all government decisions, including whether it will participate in a U.N. tribunal. If there is any possible good to come from Mr. Gemayel's death, it is that Hezbollah will now have to postpone its announced plan to call thousands of demonstrators into the street to bring down the government. We hope Mr. Siniora can use this time to rally the majority of Lebanese who still believe in national reconciliation and the spirit of the Cedar Revolution.\n        We would urge Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to go immediately to Beirut, except we're not sure she would be welcome after President Bush's failure last summer to restrain Israel's disastrous air war.

When dealing with Pyongyang (and for that matter, the Bush administration), a lot can slip betwixt the cup and the lip. But if all goes as agreed, the world will be safer.\n        The obvious question to ask is: What took so long? And even more important: Will President Bush learn from this belated success? Will he finally allow his diplomats to try negotiation and even compromise with other bad and undeniably dangerous governments?\n        Mr. Bush could probably have gotten this deal years ago, except that he decided he didn't have to talk to anyone he didn't like. So long as the White House refused to talk, North Korea churned out plutonium. And once American negotiators were finally allowed to mix their sanctions with sanity and seriously negotiate, they struck a deal.\n        We'll overlook the irony of this administration, which considers the word multilateral an epithet, insisting yesterday that Mr. Bush had not compromised on anything because the Chinese, Japanese, South Koreans and Russians were also involved.\n        There are still a lot of negotiations to come before North Korea disarms -- and no guarantees. If the past is prelude, it will try to reopen the bidding or try to squirrel away a few nuclear weapons or their makings. Its closest neighbors, China and South Korea, which have been enabling Pyongyang for years, will try to excuse any backsliding. So the Bush administration will have to be the deal's lead enforcer. For that, its behavior needs to be above reproach. Mr. Bush should start by ordering his aides (and his vice president) to embrace the triumph of diplomacy, no matter how much it pains them.\n        As for the lessons to be learned, there are a lot of other bad actors out there with whom Mr. Bush is still refusing to speak. Iran is resisting the White House's saber rattling and bullying. Mr. Bush could test Tehran by including it in a regional conference to discuss how to contain Iraq's chaos. And it would certainly enliven the discussion on Iran's nuclear program if the White House suggested that it would drop its plans for regime change once and for all and move toward diplomatic recognition if Tehran would control its nuclear appetites.\n        And there are others, like Syria, which might -- with the right incentives -- be persuaded to rethink its ill-begotten friendships with Hezbollah and Tehran. Or Cuba, preferably before Castro goes and the Cuban people decide their only choices are violence or remaining frozen in Communist amber for another generation. We are not saying that all of these governments will respond, even to a cold calculation of their own interests. But this administration has not tried to find out.\n        There will be a lot of talk in Washington about Mr. Bush salvaging a failing presidency. We don't want to take away from the glow. But there are a lot of other dangers out there. And we hope that Mr. Bush learns the most basic lesson of this week's deal: sometimes you really do have to talk to your enemies, even if you have to grit your teeth.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1758107,"ids":1758107,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It may be difficult for the imagination to grasp how a lobster and a mosquito are the same, especially when you try to picture the latter steamed and dipped in melted butter. But if you remember that both are arthropods -- having exoskeletons and segmented bodies, among other things -- and that immense populations of both were destroyed in this region in September 1999, a time that happens to coincide with the widespread aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion to combat the West Nile virus, a lightbulb may go off.\n        Were the lobsters chemically slaughtered, or was that just a coincidence? We may never know for sure, because a lawsuit filed on behalf of Long Island Sound's commercial lobster fishermen was settled this month. The lobstermen had sued the manufacturer of a pesticide called Fyfanon, whose active ingredient is malathion, charging that the spraying of Fyfanon in New York City and on Long Island, followed by hurricane-induced runoff into western Long Island Sound, was the main cause of the 1999 lobster massacre.\n        The die-off was sudden -- it took a matter of days -- but overwhelming. Hundreds of fishermen lost their livelihoods almost overnight. The lobster population has not recovered; the annual yield is now about one million pounds, down from six million in the late 1990's.\n        Just before the trial was to begin, Cheminova, the New Jersey company that makes Fyfanon, agreed to pay the lobstermen $12.5 million, while admitting no responsibility for the lobsters' fate. Although the plaintiffs may have wished for more, environmental lawyers say they were lucky to get what they did, since the obstacles to winning their case in court were daunting.\n        The lawyers for the lobstermen would have had to place pinpoint blame on only one chemical as the murder weapon. That would have meant ruling out a depressing array of other plausible causes, like unusually warm water (lobsters like the New England chill, and Long Island Sound is already the southern limit of their natural range), oxygen depletion, parasites and other pollutants. The shocking speed of the lobsters' deaths may have been circumstantially compelling, but the law requires definitive conclusions, which current science cannot provide.\n        The lobstermen will be compensated, but others of us who also care about the health of Long Island Sound are left to wonder what light the trial might have shone on the chemical dangers faced by the creatures who live in and around it. We may simply have to settle for a vivid reminder of something we should have already known: that Long Island Sound is a habitat stressed to its limits, and that our dim-witted actions on land can have far-ranging consequences on the water. Few people before 1999 would have thought to consider the possible connection between mosquitoes in suburban backyards and unemployed lobstermen, but many more will now.\n        Another piece of good news is that a small part of the settlement, $100,000, is being donated to the Lobster Institute at the University of Maine, which first raised the possibility of the pesticide link in the die-off, for research into the Long Island Sound lobster fishery. The more we understand these delicious bug-eyed creatures, the better off they -- and their precious, threatened habitat -- will be.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1675619,"ids":1675619,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It requires breathtaking audacity for United States officials to complain that efforts to curb opium poppy production in Afghanistan have been lagging because President Hamid Karzai ''has been unwilling to assert strong leadership.'' Washington waited almost two and a half years to heed Mr. Karzai's calls for help on this problem.\n        Even now, the Bush administration is disproportionately concentrating on the most visible, but least effective approach, forcible crop eradication, which merely moves the problem around and enriches traffickers by raising the price of their opium holdings. It is also creating turmoil in rural areas during the run-up to this year's crucial parliamentary elections.\n        Mr. Karzai was right to use his just-completed four-day visit to the United States to press for coordinating eradication with the crop substitution, agricultural credit and alternative development programs that would provide Afghanistan's rural population with better ways to feed their families. The money that Washington has promised for those broader efforts has been lagging behind, and the planning that will be required to spend that money wisely has barely begun.\n        Blaming Mr. Karzai may look smart in Washington, where forcible eradication has always been more popular than long-term alternative development. But it is costly folly in Afghanistan, where the politically nimble Mr. Karzai has slowly begun to turn around an almost impossible situation, gradually extending the writ of the central government and nurturing a fragile electoral process. Instead of using Mr. Karzai as a scapegoat for its own failed anti-drug policies, Washington should now be doing all it can to help him create favorable conditions for those parliamentary elections, which have had to be repeatedly postponed.\n        Mr. Bush should also have come up with a more thoughtful answer to the urgent request Mr. Karzai made on Monday to transfer Afghan prisoners now under United States military custody to Kabul's control.\n        Mr. Karzai's anguish over this issue is understandable. Two Times articles in recent days have documented the inexcusable breakdowns at the Bagram detention center that let American soldiers almost casually torture an innocent Afghan prisoner to death in 2002 and then saw Army investigators in Afghanistan try to close the case without any charges being brought. Seven of those suspected of involvement in the abuse have finally been charged after a nearly two-year delay that even the Pentagon acknowledges seems ''excessively long.''\n        As Afghanistan's democratically elected president and a proven American ally, Mr. Karzai would have been remiss not to call for turning over the remaining Afghan prisoners. Washington should work with his government to build and staff secure Afghan-run detention centers so that those transfers can take place at an early date.\n        Regrettably, Mr. Karzai came away from the White House on Monday without any visible progress on either of these issues.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1795790,"ids":1795790,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It seems a little too convenient. As the stretch run to the midterm Congressional election approaches, gasoline prices fall precipitously. The sudden shifts in prices seem to come out of the blue. And unlike copper or pork bellies, oil is a commodity always charged with political significance.\n        It only sets the bloggers typing faster and the pundits chattering louder when a key player in the price swing is the investment bank Goldman Sachs, whose chief executive, Henry Paulson, left to become President Bush's Treasury secretary. The suspicions were serious enough that the White House press secretary, Tony Snow, addressed them. He joked that it would take ''the kind of magisterial clout unknown to any other human being'' to rig gas prices. But with 42 percent of respondents to a Gallup poll saying that they believed the Bush administration was manipulating prices ahead of the election, it is probably not a laughing matter behind closed doors at the White House.\n        Mr. Snow is actually right -- no one can control the 85-million-barrel-a-day global market in petroleum products. But consumers' gut feeling that something is not right with the gasoline market is a recognition of fundamental changes in supply and demand that have made prices more volatile and attracted ever more speculation. Average Americans find themselves at the whim of an increasingly capricious market, one that strikes hard in the pocketbook. And it might become worse.\n        Our demand for petroleum products strains the limits of the global capacity to supply them. In past decades, if a pipeline broke in Nigeria, Saudi Arabia might compensate by setting workers to pumping more oil. Now, with little additional capacity, rising prices are necessary to balance out supply and demand. Each bump can feel like an earthquake. But to speculators, volatility means the potential for big profits, so hedge funds and investment banks pile in to make bets, bidding oil futures up to unnatural highs and making the market even more unstable.\n        Summer is usually a time when prices go up; as families climb into minivans for vacations, demand increases. Predictions of another dire hurricane season this summer had the speculators salivating as they envisioned big storms headed for those oil rigs and refineries along the Gulf Coast. When the hurricanes failed to materialize and the driving season came to an unimpressive ending, the shouts of ''Buy!'' turned to cries of ''Sell!''\n        Consumers may be relieved to find that prices at the gas pump plunged as a result, but unfortunately they could very well be in for more volatility and new price spikes down the road. As long as the demand for oil and gasoline grows faster than the ability to produce and refine them, the slightest shocks to supply will keep sending prices rocketing higher. The only way to get a stable market back is to cut back consumption, through greater efficiency and alternative fuels.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1849370,"ids":1849370,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It seems the more unpopular Pakistan's military dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, becomes at home and the less he is willing to fight the Taliban, the more the Bush administration clings to him.\n        Washington is afraid, and entirely not without reason, that nuclear armed Pakistan's next ruler could be even worse. The answer is not to stand by while the general cranks up his repression. That only feeds the fundamentalist and anti-American passions that Washington fears.\n        Instead of propping up the general, Washington should use the leverage it gets from roughly $2 billion a year in aid to encourage an early return to democratic rule.\n        Since Sept. 11, 2001, the United States has been paying about half that amount each year to reimburse Pakistan's military for fighting Taliban and Al Qaeda forces along the Afghan border. Eight months ago, General Musharraf radically pared back those efforts, but the lavish American payments have continued. Cutting back on those patrols makes it easier for the Taliban and Al Qaeda to kill American and NATO troops. Congress must insist that future payments be linked to actual counterterrorist activity and results, as some American military officials now recommend.\n        Washington's uncritical support has also reinforced the general's arrogance and insularity, which are at the heart of his current political problems. In March, he arbitrarily suspended Pakistan's independent-minded chief justice, setting off protest demonstrations which have continued ever since. The suspension came as the court was preparing to hear challenges to the general's schemes to keep himself in power -- as both army commander and president -- with his presidential candidacy ratified by the current, submissive Parliament, not the new one due to be elected later this year.\n        Members of the general's ruling party are now urging him to reach a compromise. Some are even calling on him to open up the election to other serious contenders, including two former prime ministers, Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, now living in exile. Both governments were badly stained with corruption. But there can be no meaningful return to democracy without the free participation of Pakistan's two most popular political leaders. General Musharraf is resisting this good advice, but could change his mind if Washington added its voice to the call for free elections.\n        A succession of uniformed dictators has misruled Pakistan for more than half of its 60-year history.

Nothing should be more obvious for an American president than to support a ban on torture.\n        But this is the president who scrapped the rules on the decent treatment of prisoners in the first place and whose lawyers concocted memos on legalizing torture. On further reflection, the feeling of relief faded fast.\n        Mr. McCain's amendment is attached to a malignant measure -- introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and now co-sponsored by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee -- that would do grievous harm to the rule that the government cannot just lock you up without showing cause to a court. This fundamental principle of democratic justice must not be watered down so the Bush administration does not have to answer for the illegal detentions of hundreds of men at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and other prison camps.\n        Mr. Graham's original measure would at least have barred the use of coerced confessions from prisoners like those at Guant\u00e1namo. But the current version actually appears to allow coerced evidence. Lawmakers were also discussing language that would strip United States courts, including the Supreme Court, of the power to review detentions. Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law at Yale University, said that Congress had not attacked the courts in this fashion since Reconstruction.\n        Mr. Bush had barely announced his deal with Mr. McCain before Attorney General Alberto Gonzales made it crystal clear that the administration would define torture any way it liked. He said on CNN that torture meant the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental harm, and repeated the word ''severe'' twice. He would not even say whether that included ''waterboarding'' -- tormenting a prisoner by making him think he is being drowned.\n        Then Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, announced that he would oppose the McCain measure unless the White House guaranteed in writing that it would have no effect on intelligence-gathering. Mr. Hunter's legitimate concerns have already been addressed with a provision that would allow C.I.A. agents to defend themselves against torture charges by saying they were following legal orders. That protection is already provided to uniformed soldiers. The latest objections by Mr. Hunter, who has helped Vice President Dick Cheney try to block Mr. McCain's amendment, are just a smokescreen.\n        What is at stake here, and so harmful to America's reputation, is the routine mistreatment of prisoners swept up in the so-called war on terror. The Senate voted 90 to 9 for the McCain measure without the extra baggage. And the House passed a nonbinding resolution supporting it. Both should stand firm. The nation and its fighting men and women need moral clarity, not more legalistic wiggle room.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1827752,"ids":1827752,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"It speaks volumes when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice flies to Jerusalem to try to revive peace talks between Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and cannot even get the two to show up when she reads out the content-free joint statement to which they have grudgingly agreed.\n        Volume 1 reminds us of the six feckless years during which the Bush administration has squandered America's once commanding prestige in the region. Volume 2 portrays a secretary of state who clearly arrived with no new ideas -- and no idea of how to wheedle or pressure either side into making any of the compromises needed to stimulate the dangerously moribund peace effort.\n        Ms. Rice's diplomatic default was all the keener since this just might have been a moment for breaking the stalemate that has prevailed since Hamas won control of the Palestinian Parliament last year.\n        Hamas's refusal to accept Israel's right to exist and its people's right to live free from terrorism is undeniably the biggest single obstacle to peace. But Mr. Abbas and his more moderate Fatah movement already accept both points. And the imperfect agreement Mr. Abbas reached with Hamas this month on a cease-fire between the two groups (reeling them back from civil war) and a coalition government gave him more authority, after months of flailing, to bargain on behalf of the Palestinians.\n        Israel could have reinforced Mr. Abbas's position and increased the chances for progress with a series of low-risk steps: committing to serious negotiations, freezing the expansion of settlements and easing restrictions on civilians' movements in the West Bank. Those steps would have given new hope to Palestinian moderates and thereby increased the political pressure on Hamas to abandon terrorism.\n        Instead, Ms. Rice indulged Mr. Olmert's inherent caution and his own political weakness, settling for an agreement that the two leaders will meet again some (still to be determined) day. Israel further qualified that promise yesterday, threatening to stop talking to Mr. Abbas altogether if he forms a coalition government with Hamas. With Palestinian frustrations rising -- and demographers predicting an eventual Palestinian majority between the Mediterranean and the Jordan -- just saying no is not a viable option for Israel.

When he did, in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Utah this week, he said exactly the wrong thing. In an address that repeatedly invoked Sept. 11 -- the day that terrorists who had no discernable connection whatsoever to Iraq attacked targets on American soil -- Mr. Bush offered a new reason for staying the course: to keep faith with the men and women who have already died in the war.\n        ''We owe them something,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We will finish the task that they gave their lives for.'' It was, as the mother of one fallen National Guardsman said, an argument that ''makes no sense.'' No one wants young men and women to die just because others have already made the ultimate sacrifice. The families of the dead do not want that, any more than they want to see more soldiers die because politicians cannot bear to admit that they sent American forces to war by mistake.\n        Most Americans believed that their country had invaded Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction, but we know now that those weapons did not exist. If we had all known then what we know now, the invasion would have been stopped by a popular outcry, no matter what other motives the president and his advisers may have had.\n        It is also very clear, although the president has done his level best to muddy the picture, that Iraq had nothing to do with Sept. 11. Mr. Bush's insistence on making that link, over and over, is irresponsible. In fact, it was the American-led invasion that turned Iraq into a haven for Islamist extremists.\n        When Mr. Bush articulated his ''comprehensive strategy'' for responding to the threat of terrorism, he listed three aims: ''protecting this homeland, taking the fight to the enemy and advancing freedom.'' The invasion of Iraq flunks the first two tests. But it did free the Iraqi people from a brutal dictator and may still provide an opportunity to inspire the rest of the Arab world with an example of democracy and religious toleration.\n        Right now, however, the Iraqi Assembly is dickering over a constitution draft that would not accomplish any of the American goals. It would fail to protect the rights of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority and the rights of women, and it would enshrine Islam as a main source of law. It could well lead to a fracturing of Iraq into an all but independent, and oil-rich, Kurdish homeland in the north and an oil-rich Shiite theocracy in the south, while the oil-poor center was left to the disaffected Sunnis, the terrorists and the American troops. It's an outcome that would make the violent religious extremists very happy.\n        Preventing that kind of tragic last chapter is the only rational argument for continuing the American presence in Iraq. The president's strange declaration yesterday that the draft constitution would protect the rights of women and minorities, and his continuing attempts to clog the debate with misleading explanations, suggest his own lack of commitment to the only rationale for keeping American troops in Iraq -- or, perhaps, his lack of faith in the likely outcome.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1756361,"ids":1756361,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It took a long time for people to recognize the value of a swamp.

That will require more than just an immediate halt to hostilities by both sides and an early withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon. It will also require the dispatch of an international military force with sufficient authority and firepower to guarantee that there can be no repeat of the Hezbollah provocations that set off this destructive conflict.\n        The Council's resolution represents a compromise between the United States and France, and standing behind them, Israel and Lebanon. Washington wanted Israeli withdrawals linked to a political settlement and a strong new international force. France wanted Israeli withdrawal to come first.\n        They finally agreed to combine elements of both approaches, with some of the language on Israeli withdrawals left elliptical and some of the language on the international force left implicit. These locutions must not be allowed to unravel the consensus that more than a mere cease-fire is needed.\n        As hard as it will be to seal the border against Hezbollah infiltrations into Israel, that will not be enough. Hezbollah has rockets that can be fired from deep inside Lebanon at targets deep inside Israel.

But it cannot disguise the cost that all of Lebanon has paid. Israel incurred civilian and military losses and inflamed Islamic and world opinion without succeeding in destroying Hezbollah or its rocket arsenal.\n        Washington, which rightly stood by Israel but wrongly refused to call for a cease-fire or engage in meaningful diplomacy with Syria, also paid a price that could further complicate problems in Iraq and Afghanistan.

''As all of us saw on television, there is also some deep, persistent poverty in this region as well,'' he said. ''And that poverty has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from the opportunity of America. We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action. So let us restore all that we have cherished from yesterday, and let us rise above the legacy of inequality.''\n        Toward that end, Mr. Bush proposed a Gulf Opportunity Zone to provide tax incentives and loans for small businesses, including minority-owned ones. He asked Congress to pass what he called an Urban Homesteading Act, which he said would provide, through a lottery, free building sites on federal land for low-income citizens. ''Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes, we will stay as long as it takes, to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives,'' the president said.\n        That was a month ago. This week, the only talk about legislative action has come from the conservative Republicans calling for new holes in the social safety net, while the president remains mum about that -- and just about everything else. Administration officials have yet to put forward any kind of legislative blueprint for Congress on the Gulf Opportunity Zone. A spokesman for Mr. Bush, Trent Duffy, told reporters that the proposal is ''pending in Congress,'' whatever that means. He waved off any idea that ''the White House would send a big 'Here's Our Recovery' package.''\n        But, of course, that was exactly what Americans expected the White House to do. There seems to be no coordinated plan, no single person in charge of making the recovery happen. With this president, there is a vast gulf between words and action.\n        Americans were understandably dismayed when confronted with President Bush's slow response to the unfolding disaster of Hurricane Katrina. They were equally dismayed by the evident lack of disaster expertise among the men the president had tapped to handle such emergencies. Mr. Bush was supposed to have put an end to that dismal story when he spoke at Jackson Square. But that seems to have been nothing but a grand and meaningless gesture. Where are the actual programs he's supposed to be putting into place to rebuild the city? Administration officials say they have located about 4,000 federal properties that could be provided as part of the urban homesteading proposal Mr. Bush announced in New Orleans. That is a drop in the bucket when compared with the actual need; more than a quarter of a million homes were damaged or destroyed by Katrina. How will the recovery work?

Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that she and United States Representative Peter King were teaming up on a proposal to get $250 million in federal aid to revitalize old suburbs. The Nassau county executive, Thomas Suozzi, outlined his dream of ''new suburbia'' in a PowerPoint presentation. His Suffolk counterpart, Steve Levy, spoke eloquently of the need to secure Long Island's future by creating new housing, reclaiming old buildings and brownfields and preserving open space.\n        The government officials, builders, academics and corporate executives at the event, a symposium on ''Suburban Evolution'' sponsored by the Long Island Housing Partnership, were fully receptive to the message. It was a day for harmony and applause. There were few discordant notes.\n        There might have been more, though, if a woman in an elegant brown suit had succeeded in getting anyone's attention in the final question-and-answer session. She tried, but Mr. King, the moderator, apparently could not see her past the spotlight's glare; the Southold town supervisor was hogging the microphone; and then everybody broke for lunch.\n        She was Dorothy Goosby, a councilwoman in the town of Hempstead. As she explained later, she was trying to bring up a point that she thought the event had conspicuously ignored. Ms. Goosby, Hempstead's only African-American council member, said she feared that new affordable-housing units were being too heavily concentrated in her predominantly black district. She worried, too, that converting former commercial properties into apartments could upset the economic balance there. Communities need a healthy mix of housing and commerce, she said, and affordable housing is a much better proposition when the apartments are spread around.\n        Ms. Goosby has a point, and we are sorry she was not able to share it. A discussion of race and class is crucial to any rethinking of the future of Long Island, one of the nation's most segregated suburban areas, but the polite participants in ''Suburban Evolution'' hit on it barely at all.\n        Mr. Levy came closest in his lunchtime remarks, when he stressed the need to transcend the ''pull-up-the-ladder Nimbyism'' that hinders smart-growth ideas on Long Island. Mr. Suozzi touched on it, too, with his call to integrate largely black Hempstead by building plenty of affordable apartments there for the (presumably white) students from colleges in the area.\n        But other speakers argued that smart growth would gain wider support if people understood that ''affordable housing'' applied mainly to those who were already in their communities: the young adults in parents' basements and retirees rattling around in empty nests, not the strivers from poorer communities next door. In so many words, these speakers seemed to reflect the views uncovered in a recent Rauch Foundation study, which found that while Long Islanders were increasingly receptive to the idea of affordable housing, a majority also worried that such housing would bring in ''the wrong kind of people.''\n        We're not sure what that phrase means, exactly. But given Long Island's stark color boundaries, we have a pretty good idea. Unless the preachers of Long Island's smart-growth gospel tackle this issue head on, the new Long Island could end up looking a lot like the old.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1706937,"ids":1706937,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It was almost inevitable that we would see every kind of legislative lunacy after Katrina, proposed in the name of accelerating the cleanup in New Orleans, improving the nation's energy security or achieving other worthy objectives.

This is the same Richard Pombo who proposed last week -- joking, he said -- to sell off a few lesser-known national parks if money from the Arctic refuge was not forthcoming.\n        Then there is Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who, ostensibly to increase fuel supplies, rammed a bill through the House energy committee that would ease clean air restrictions on refineries and drive a final nail in the coffin of New Source Review, a useful law the administration has been trying to kill for years. The law requires older industrial facilities to install modern pollution controls, and Mr. Barton's bill would remove not only refineries but hundreds of coal-fired power plants from its reach.\n        Similar mischief is afoot in the Senate, where James Inhofe, the ferociously anti-regulatory Oklahoma Republican who runs the environment committee, would suspend for up to 18 months any environmental law that in his view stands in the way of post-hurricane reconstruction.\n        The most egregious example of self-dealing comes from the Louisiana delegation. Not content with the $62.3 billion Congress has already appropriated for emergency relief, the state's representatives have asked for $250 billion more in federal reconstruction funds, equal to more than $50,000 per Louisiana resident.\n        This seems a bit much, especially since the proposal also calls for suspending important environmental reviews and funneling huge sums to the Army Corps of Engineers for projects that seem to have more to do with the delegation's political ambitions than with flood control and the intelligent restoration of the Louisiana Delta.\n        Congress's first obligation is to help Louisiana's stricken residents get back on their feet.

But when a second important Republican stands up and excuses murderous violence against judges as an understandable reaction to their decisions, then it is time to get really scared.\n        It happened on Monday, in a moment that was horrifying even by the rock-bottom standards of the campaign that Republican zealots are conducting against the nation's judiciary. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, rose in the chamber and dared to argue that recent courthouse violence might be explained by distress about judges who ''are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public.'' The frustration ''builds up and builds up to the point where some people engage in'' violence, said Mr. Cornyn, a former member of the Texas Supreme Court who is on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which supposedly protects the Constitution and its guarantee of an independent judiciary.\n        Listeners could only cringe at the events behind Mr. Cornyn's fulminating: an Atlanta judge was murdered in his courtroom by a career criminal who wanted only to shoot his way out of a trial, and a Chicago judge's mother and husband were executed by a deranged man who was furious that she had dismissed a wild lawsuit. It was sickening that an elected official would publicly offer these sociopaths as examples of any democratic value, let alone as holders of legitimate concerns about the judiciary.\n        The need to shield judges from outside threats -- including those from elected officials like Senator Cornyn -- is a priceless principle of our democracy. Senator Cornyn offered a smarmy proclamation of ''great distress'' at courthouse thuggery. Then he rationalized it with broadside accusations that judges ''make raw political or ideological decisions.'' He thumbed his nose at the separation of powers, suggesting that the Supreme Court be ''an enforcer of political decisions made by elected representatives of the people.'' Avoiding that nightmare is precisely why the founders made federal judgeships lifetime jobs and created a nomination process that requires presidents to seek bipartisan support.\n        Echoes of the political hijacking of the Terri Schiavo case hung in the air as Mr. Cornyn spoke, just days after the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, vengefully vowed that ''the time will come'' to make the judges who resisted the Congressional Republicans' gruesome deathbed intrusion ''answer for their behavior.'' Trying to intimidate judges used to be a crime, not a bombastic cudgel for cynical politicians.\n        The public's hope must be that Senator Cornyn's shameful outburst gives further pause to Senate moderates about the threats of the majority leader, Senator Bill Frist, to scrap the filibuster to ensure the confirmation of President Bush's most extremist judicial nominees. Dr. Frist tried to distance himself yesterday from Mr. DeLay's attack on the judiciary. But Dr. Frist must carry the militants' baggage if he is ever to run for president, and he complained yesterday of ''a real fire lighted by Democrats around judges over the last few days.''\n        By Democrats?

Unfortunately, that was about the only good news in the newest Pentagon report on prisoner abuse, actually a 21-page summary of a larger, classified study by the Navy inspector general of interrogation rules in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n        Just consider that it took more than a year after the military says it first learned of the nightmare at Abu Ghraib to issue the new rules. And don't ask what they are, because they're classified. The report spoke of the regulations approvingly. But its author, Vice Admiral Albert Church III, now director of the Navy staff, admitted yesterday that, well, he had not actually read them.\n        This whitewash is typical of the reports issued by the Bush administration on the abuse, humiliation and torture of prisoners at camps run by the military and the Central Intelligence Agency. Like the others, the Church report concludes that only the lowest-ranking soldiers are to be held accountable, not their commanders or their civilian overseers.\n        It conveniently ignores President Bush's declaration that terrorists are not covered by the Geneva Conventions and that Iraq is part of the war against terror. Mr. Bush later said the conventions would cover Iraqi military prisoners, but the Church report said military commanders in Iraq had never been given guidance on handling prisoners, a vast majority of whom were not soldiers. Still, the report tossed this off as merely a ''missed opportunity.'' It overlooked Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's approval of interrogation techniques for Guant\u00e1namo that violated the Geneva Conventions. It glossed over the way military lawyers who were drafting later rules were ordered to ignore their own legal opinions and instead follow Justice Department memos on how to make torture seem legal.\n        The Church report said that ''none of the pictured abuses at Abu Ghraib bear any resemblance to approved policies at any level, in any theater.'' Admiral Church and his investigators must have missed the pictures of prisoners in hoods, forced into stress positions and threatened by dogs. All of those techniques were approved at one time or another by military officials, including Mr. Rumsfeld. Of course, no known Pentagon policy orders the sexual humiliation of prisoners. But that has happened so pervasively that it clearly was not just the perverted antics of one night shift in one cellblock at Abu Ghraib.\n        The Church report said assessing the personal responsibility of Mr. Rumsfeld and other top officials had been the job of another panel headed by a former defense secretary, James Schlesinger. Well, not exactly. That group, appointed by Mr. Rumsfeld, found ''both institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels'' for Abu Ghraib. But the panel declined to name names.\n        Who will? Not the Pentagon, clearly. The Senate Armed Services Committee plans another hearing or two, but that's inadequate. Congressional leaders could open a serious investigation, but have shown no interest, although they are issuing subpoenas on steroid use by baseball players.\n        We're not holding out much hope that the White House will step into the breach because Mr. Bush has rewarded many of the officials responsible for the prison policies -- one of them now serves as attorney general. Still, the only real solution is for Mr. Bush to follow the American Bar Association's advice and appoint an independent, bipartisan commission.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":5,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1671629,"ids":1671629,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It was heartwarming to see President Bush welcomed warmly in Riga, Latvia, and drawing huge crowds in Tbilisi, Georgia, but his trip through the former Soviet Union hit a home run on public relations while striking out on substance. The one overriding American concern when it comes to Russia is nuclear security and nonproliferation, and on that front, it appears nothing was accomplished.\n        Strong United States support for two of the most democratic former Soviet republics is appropriate and welcome, although it cannot disguise the precipitous decline in American relations with many of the larger countries of Western Europe. But it is Russia, not Latvia or Georgia, that still has more than 10,000 armed nuclear warheads and vast insecure stockpiles of nuclear bomb fuel. And it is also Russia whose willingness to cajole and pressure Iran could help dissuade that country from taking the few remaining steps needed for it to become a nuclear weapons state.\n        The Moscow stop brought no significant new announcements on either nuclear front, just elaborately orchestrated theatrics that were apparently meant to show that despite Mr. Bush's anti-Moscow finger-pointing from beyond Russia's borders, his strong personal bond with Mr. Putin remains intact. In fact, the worrisomely authoritarian Mr. Putin seemed to come off rather better than the incontestably democratic Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill -- in a lunge at historical revisionism, Mr. Bush glibly took those great World War II leaders to task for acceding to Stalin's power grabs in Eastern Europe that they were militarily powerless to halt.\n        Previous meetings between Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin have yielded agreements on sharp cuts in long-range nuclear-armed missiles and bombers. The last time they met, in February, they announced an agreement to combat nuclear terrorism by accelerating joint programs meant to secure poorly safeguarded Russian bomb fuel. What is needed now is final resolution of a dispute over liability that threatens to hold up those vital nuclear security programs, along with joint moves to take thousands of nuclear warheads off hair-trigger alert (Russia's are increasingly vulnerable to a catastrophic accidental launching as its early warning system continues to erode). The two nations should also proceed to overdue reductions in tactical nuclear warheads, which are more easily stolen or bartered than missile-mounted long-range warheads.\n        Measurable progress on these fronts would have been helpful to the struggling Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty review conference now under way in New York, where nonnuclear nations are increasingly challenging the reluctance of the major nuclear powers to reduce their weapons inventories. Any presidential trip that skirted that issue has to be judged a failure. Still, Mr. Bush is returning home with lots of politically priceless footage from Riga and Tbilisi.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1688938,"ids":1688938,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It was immensely encouraging to see Republican and Democratic lawmakers testify together yesterday about the need for the federal government to follow the lead of 49 states and guarantee that journalists are allowed the right to protect the names of confidential sources in most circumstances. Two Republicans, Senator Richard Lugar and Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, and Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, spoke eloquently about the role of a free press in a democracy. They have also shown that drafting a responsible shield law is not as hard as some critics say. Just this week, they amended bills pending in both houses of Congress to address the government's concern that the rights of reporters should not override the security of the nation when it faces an imminent threat.\n        But the day's testimony was also disturbing. Witnesses spoke of the dozens of subpoenas that have been issued to journalists in recent times and the half-dozen or more reporters who have been found to be in contempt of court for doing their jobs -- some journalists, like Judith Miller of The Times, have actually been jailed. As Mr. Dodd pointed out, the idea that jailing reporters will inhibit journalism is not a theoretical worry. Norman Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., testified yesterday that since his decision to turn over notes in the Valerie Wilson case to the federal prosecutor, Time reporters had shown him mail ''from valuable sources who insisted that they no longer trusted the magazine.'' The Cleveland Plain Dealer has announced it will not publish two investigative reports because they are based on leaked documents and the paper fears the possibility of subpoenas. Its editor said, ''Jail is too high a price to pay.'' We regret that decision, but it should at least ring alarm bells for Congress.\n        The amendments added this week to bills before the Senate and the House would provide for the forced disclosure of confidential sources ''to prevent imminent and actual harm to the national security.'' It is a narrow exception that journalists should support, because as William Safire, the retired Times columnist, testified yesterday, ''We are not seeking an absolute privilege.'' We second Mr. Safire's caution that an imminent threat means an actual and urgent threat, not a potential threat.\n        Mr. Safire and the other witnesses deftly refuted the arguments that have been used to cloud the debate. There is no case on record, for example, of a newspaper's claiming the right to protect a violent criminal. Nor is there any reason to believe that a journalistic privilege would hamper prosecutions any more than the privileges already granted to doctors, psychiatrists, lawyers and spouses. There is no case on record where prosecutions have not been brought or have failed because of shield laws in states where such laws -- including many providing absolute protection -- have been on the books for decades.\n        We wish the Justice Department had shown enough interest to send a witness to this important hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee. But there should be no doubts left about bipartisan support for a federal shield law, or about the practicality of drafting one that protects both a vital institution of democracy and national security. Congress, which has managed to consider pork-barrel spending and corporate giveaways, should be able to find the time to pass such a vital law in this session.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1650886,"ids":1650886,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"It was inevitable that Alan Greenspan would make news when he testified before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday that he supported private accounts in Social Security. ''So if you're going to move to private accounts, which I approve of,'' he said, ''I think you have to do it in a cautious, gradual way.''\n        But Mr. Greenspan said so much more that, by any measure of logical consistency, could hardly be read as approval.\n        He said repeatedly that the crucial underlying problem for the United States economy was a lack of national savings -- the sum of government and individual savings, an important aspect of the nation's overall standard of living. Under questioning, he also said, repeatedly and quite rightly, that moving to private accounts within Social Security would not add to national savings. That's because every dollar that went into a private account would be offset by the money that the government would need to borrow upfront to establish the private system.\n        Mr. Greenspan also stressed the importance of closing Social Security's long-term funding gap -- an estimated $3.7 trillion hole that will develop over 75 years, the usual span of time used by Social Security's trustees to gauge the system's soundness. Then he pointed out that money accumulating in private accounts would do nothing to close the long-term funding gap in Social Security. The only way to do that is to increase taxes or cut benefits, or to adopt some combination of the two. Unlike the president, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged the huge benefit cuts that would be inherent in a private system. Speaking of Mr. Bush, he said, ''I gather what he has in mind is that the amounts that go into the private accounts are offset, after discount, with benefits that would have been paid with those monies in the Social Security system.'' That's Greenspan-ese for this: ''Every dollar you put into a private account, plus interest, would be subtracted from your traditional Social Security benefit.''\n        As the nation's top banker, Mr. Greenspan was on surer ground when discussing the borrowing needed to establish private accounts -- an estimated $2 trillion over 10 years, and $4.5 trillion over two decades. He said it would be a risky thing to do.\n        When Mr. Greenspan ventured into politics in 2001, he gave his blessing for Mr. Bush's huge tax cuts. Today, thanks in part to those tax cuts, the surplus Mr. Bush inherited is a $412 billion budget deficit, and the president's own budget proposal projects deficits as far as the eye can see. If Mr. Greenspan really wants to increase national savings, he should advocate cutting the deficit. If he really wants to close the gap in Social Security, he should not shy away from prudent tax increases. And if he wants to keep the financial markets calm, he should disapprove of enormous borrowing.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1640113,"ids":1640113,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It was nice to hear Alberto Gonzales tell the Senate Judiciary Committee in his opening statement yesterday that he doesn't approve of torture and that as attorney general, he'll uphold the law. But things went rapidly downhill after that. By the time the hearing ended, Mr. Gonzales, now the White House counsel, had turned it into one of those depressing exercises in avoiding straight answers and evading accountability. The spectacle brought to mind the hearings last spring when Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his team dutifully denounced the horrors of Abu Ghraib and then refused to accept any responsibility.\n        Mr. Gonzales said the Abu Ghraib photos ''sickened and outraged'' him. But he would not acknowledge that he or any other senior administration official was to blame, even though he was a central figure in the policy decisions that laid the groundwork for the abuse at Abu Ghraib and other American military prisons.\n        In broad terms, Mr. Gonzales offered the politically necessary repudiation of the Justice Department memo that said Mr. Bush could authorize Americans to torture prisoners with impunity and that redefined torture to exclude almost any brutality.\n        But it took a half-dozen questions by almost as many senators to get Mr. Gonzales to say declaratively that he now rejects that specific view, which the administration allowed to stand for nearly two years, until it was disclosed by news accounts. And then he equivocated astonishingly when asked whether American soldiers or intelligence agents could ''legally engage in torture under any circumstances.''\n        ''I don't believe so, but I'd want to get back to you on that and make sure I don't provide a misleading answer,'' said Mr. Gonzales, who went through many hours of preparation for these very questions.\n        Blaming a faulty memory, Mr. Gonzales would not provide anything close to a clear account of his role in the formulation of the policy on the treatment of prisoners. At one point, he said the 2002 memo was just the opinion of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. Then he called it the ''binding interpretation'' of anti-torture statutes and treaties. Later, Mr. Gonzales called it ''an arguable interpretation of the law.''\n        Even his vows of allegiance to the rule of law were rather peculiar. He said that as White House counsel, he had represented ''only the White House,'' while as attorney general, he ''would have a far broader responsibility: to pursue justice for all the people of our great nation, to see that the laws are enforced in a fair and impartial manner for all Americans.'' We thought that was also the obligation of the president and his staff.\n        Mr. Gonzales is said to face a sure confirmation. But thanks to the members of the committee, including some Republicans, who met their duty to question Mr. Gonzales aggressively, the hearing served to confirm that Mr. Bush had made the wrong choice when he rewarded Mr. Gonzales for his loyalty. The nation deserves an attorney general who is not the public face for inhumane, illegal and clearly un-American policies.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1792346,"ids":1792346,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It would be hilarious if it were not such a rip-off of New Jersey's beleaguered taxpayers.\n        We're talking about the system that allows select public employees to win pension rights for three, four and, in one extreme case, 11 jobs they have held over the course of their careers. Some of these part-timers -- lawyers, municipal judges, assessors, even plumbers -- will receive state pensions of $100,000 a year and more, in addition to what they have earned in the private sector.\n        And all this is happening in a state that is seriously short of money. As it approached the new fiscal year beginning last July 1, New Jersey faced a $4 billion deficit, bridged only after a one-week government shutdown and a subsequent increase in the sales tax. Legislators in special session are now examining ways to permanently reduce public employee expenses like health benefits and pensions so that taxes can be stabilized.\n        Here's how the pension system operates: Professionals who work part-time for multiple government bodies -- like town or county governments and school boards -- win pension rights from each one. Retirement benefits are not billed directly to local taxpayers, but they affect the state budget, which in turn reduces the money available for state aid to local schools and municipalities.\n        In many states, part-timers like these are treated as independent contractors, and do not qualify for pensions. Not so in New Jersey. According to a list released last month, the 50 top earners averaged 22 years of employment and qualified for pensions ranging from $40,000 to more than $135,000.\n        Herbert Klitzner of Secaucus, for instance, made $227,000 as a lawyer for North Bergen and the Union City school district. A public employee for 25 years, Mr. Klitzner would qualify for a pension of about $103,000 a year if he retired now. He told The Times that pensions are an important inducement for those who work part-time in public jobs. ''You can make more money as a lawyer in private practice,'' he said, ''but you make it up with the benefits.''\n        Gov. Jon Corzine and some lawmakers have called for major changes in the state's pension system, including an end to the practice in which part-time professionals qualify for enrollment in the regular state pension system. But the change may be a hard sell in Trenton because some legislators do exactly this sort of work, while others wonder whether the system really makes all that much difference to the state budget.\n        However, the fiscal crisis in New Jersey -- and the high taxes it generates -- can only be corrected if the entire range of extravagant spending practices is addressed. Another abuse, noted before on this page, allows certain full-time officials to pile up unused sick and vacation time, and then be paid for it when they retire. Some have walked away with checks of $200,000 and more.\n        Until Mr. Corzine and the Legislature end these abuses, tax reform will be nothing more than another New Jersey joke.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1726913,"ids":1726913,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It's a sad day when a police force generally known for its professionalism is caught using underhanded tactics to spy on and even distort political protests and mass rallies. Yet that is precisely what an archive of videotapes shows New York City police officers or people working with them doing at seven public gatherings since August 2004. The sorry tale was laid out by Jim Dwyer in yesterday's Times in an article based on civilian and police videotapes gathered by a forensic analyst critical of the tactics.\n        The most disturbing instance of improper behavior occurred last year during the Republican National Convention, when a sham arrest of a man secretly working with the police set off a bruising confrontation with demonstrators.\n        The man, who had vivid blond hair, was holding a sign at a march of poor people when the police suddenly moved to arrest him. Onlookers shouted at the police to let him go, and officers in riot gear responded by pushing against the crowd. Protesters were put on the ground, and at least two were arrested. Meanwhile, the blond-haired man spoke quietly with the police and was quickly led away. The same man was videotaped at an arrest scene a day earlier calling out words that seemed intended to rile the bystanders.\n        This was a deliberate effort to incite violence that would in turn justify a tough police response.\n        Another disturbing incident occurred last year when a police helicopter, attempting to track bicycle riders at night through the Lower East Side, recorded nearly four minutes of a couple's intimate moments on the secluded terrace of a Second Avenue penthouse. The night-vision camera did not catch the couple's most personal moments, but the invasion of privacy proved deeply upsetting and brought a formal complaint from one of the victims. It was a sobering reminder for those who generally favor surveillance, as the penthouse owner does, that covert spying often sweeps up innocent victims.\n        The questionable police tactics may have been fostered by a national mood that favored tough antiterrorism measures after Sept. 11, 2001, even if that meant an erosion of civil liberties. The same impulse to overreach that led the Bush administration to intercept Americans' international communications without warrants, and that emboldened the F.B.I. to spy on groups like Greenpeace and the Catholic Worker movement, was surely at work in New York when the police spied on people protesting the Iraq war, bicyclists riding in a mass rally and even mourners at a street vigil.\n        Mayor Michael Bloomberg's record on free speech is already pretty poor. Unless he wants to make a disregard for New Yorkers' rights part of his legacy, he should make sure that the police understand what civil liberties mean in a democracy.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1818761,"ids":1818761,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It's any librarian's nightmare. Boisterous middle school youngsters just out of school barge through the library door and do what some kids have been doing since time immemorial: talk loudly, push each other back and forth and make a general nuisance of themselves for many of the other patrons trying to read, study or use the computers.\n        In Maplewood, a middle class suburb just 10 miles west of Newark, library officials said ''enough'' a few weeks ago and announced they would close both of the town's libraries each weekday starting Tuesday from 2:45 until 5 p.m. By that time, they hoped, the obstreperous kids would be home or at least somewhere far from the libraries.\n        One can certainly understand the librarians' frustrations; after all, they are trained to assist patrons in locating library material and doing research, not to be disciplinarians. But the idea of closing a library during prime hours was an inappropriately heavy-handed way to react to a problem that many libraries across the country have been dealing with for generations.\n        Not surprisingly, the announcement dismayed a great many people, and the township's governing committee asked the library board to reconsider its decision. Both library and township officials met last week in an effort to avoid the closing, and the library board is scheduled to meet today to rethink the closings.\n        That would be a positive first step, and would give the township committee time to explore suggestions that the town create a permanent facility where youngsters could go after school lets out. Many activists in town say teenagers with working parents simply have no suitable place to congregate during the late afternoon.\n        In the meantime, there are things the library can do on its own to accommodate the students. Leslie Burger, the director of the Princeton, N.J. library and the president of the American Library Association, points out that youngsters started frequenting her library's new facility shortly after it opened a couple of years ago. She then hired three retired persons with skills in handling young people to work part-time with the youngsters in a positive rather than just a disciplinary way.\n        Obviously, such a program would require modest funding, and that's where Maplewood's township committee should provide some help.\n        At a time when student reading scores are declining and young people are spending more and more time tethered to all manner of electronic screens -- everything from text-messaging cell phones to video iPods to computers and, yes, TV's -- librarians have a responsibility to do almost anything to welcome students to their facilities. By resolving their current difficulties and keeping their libraries open during weekday afternoons, Maplewood officials have an opportunity to set an example for public libraries across the country.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1697144,"ids":1697144,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It's been obvious for some time that state governments are taking the problems of global warming and oil dependency much more seriously than the Bush administration is, and have been far more creative in devising solutions. Hardly a month goes by without another example of the gap between palpable alarm at the state level and Washington's stubborn passivity. This week provided two more.\n        Exhibit A was the disclosure in The Times that New York and eight other Northeastern states have reached a tentative agreement on a regional plan to reduce power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global-warming gas. The plan would establish a cap on these emissions as well as a market-based system for trading pollution permits. That system would be aimed at helping utilities meet mandatory targets as cheaply and efficiently as possible.\n        The plan is the first of its kind in the nation dealing with greenhouse gas emissions, though a similar approach has already been successfully applied to acid rain pollution. The plan is based on a regulatory regime that has explicitly been rejected by the Bush administration in favor of a softer voluntary approach, which has yielded little progress so far. The architects of the new plan, including Gov. George Pataki of New York, hope that it will encourage other states to follow suit, and, ideally, persuade a hitherto reluctant Congress to adopt the kind of unified national strategy embraced in Europe but not here.\n        Exhibit B was the administration's long-awaited proposal for overhauling fuel economy standards for vehicles like S.U.V.'s, minivans and pickups, which are classified as ''light trucks.'' These vehicles account for half of all new automotive purchases, much of the country's increasing demand for imported oil and a significant percentage of its greenhouse gas emissions. The proposal was a major (though not unexpected) disappointment, calling for only a modest increase in fuel efficiency and, by the administration's own testimony, a tiny reduction in oil use -- about 10 billion gallons of gasoline over nearly two decades, or less than one month's current consumption.\n        Assuming that the automobile makers do not find new ways to ''game'' the rules, they would increase the average mileage of light trucks to about 24 miles per gallon in 2011 models, from the 21.2 miles per gallon for today's models. That is less than what the National Academy of Sciences says is achievable with existing technology. It is also far less than the efficiencies that will be required by a new California law aimed at a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by cars.\n        Several other states, including New York, have said they will adopt California's rules. The automobile companies have challenged the rules in court, advancing the argument that they constitute a backdoor, illegal usurpation of federal authority to set mileage standards. The Bush administration made much the same point in announcing its new rules on Monday.

Since we live in an era when the chasm between the lower and upper classes is growing, and the chances of moving out of poverty are getting slimmer, it's hard to imagine that working people have lost their need for a powerful advocate.\n        Still, something had to change, as shown by the much-quoted statistic about the number of union workers in the private sector: fewer than 8 percent. The labor federation has been on the ropes for years, losing battles at workplaces and in politics, and against technology and global economic change. This week, two of the largest members of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. -- the 1.8-million-member Service Employees International Union and the 1.4-million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters -- withdrew as its convention in Chicago began. Others may follow. The leader of the service employees' union, Andrew Stern, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the federation's president, John Sweeney, has now turned against his old mentor and wants Mr. Sweeney to step down.\n        The dissidents have every right to be dismayed. The unions that once organized the great blue-collar industries now mainly concentrate on managing the pain as their members watch their jobs give way to automation or globalization. If the labor movement is to survive, it must be able to move into the low-paying service sector and organize workers who are desperately in need of a champion, whose employers currently take advantage of them because there is no one to speak and act on their behalf.\n        And although few dissidents would agree, organized labor needs to acknowledge that the global economy is not going to be repealed. Pouring money into political campaigns that focus on the fact that jobs are moving to countries where wages are only a fraction of what they are in America is not a strategy. It's more like trying to bail out the tide.\n        America needs a union movement that is both feisty and sophisticated, ready to think creatively about new ways to lift up the diverse, struggling, yearning men and women who make up the working class. The chances of accomplishing that are greater if organized labor is united.\n        We hope that the factions can negotiate a peace that is not a papering over of the deep and pressing problems that bedevil the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which include an expensive and sometimes ineffective bureaucracy and a knee-jerk political strategy.

Here are some achievable goals that must not get lost.\n        Campaign Finance Reform. Council Speaker Christine Quinn should work harder with the Campaign Finance Board to strengthen and improve the local campaign finance law. The program, though perhaps the best in the country, is flawed. It allows candidates without real competition to collect public funds for campaigns. A recent appellate court decision weakened the law's enforcement mechanisms, which must now be reinforced.\n        Ms. Quinn has showed a healthy interest in curtailing the influence of special-interest lobbyists, but the larger task of bringing integrity to the political process is nowhere near complete. One major priority should be ending pay to play, in which political donors are awarded city contracts.\n        Traffic Congestion. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has offered a dazzling and hopeful plan to prepare the city for what is expected to be a substantial rise in population during the next quarter century, but unless the number of motorists is reduced, New Yorkers will choke on their own gridlock. Mr. Bloomberg needs to produce a major traffic study, move quickly to create new express bus routes and give serious thought to congestion pricing.\n        Law Enforcement. The use of excessive firepower by the police is a continuing concern made more vivid by the shooting last November of Sean Bell on his wedding day in Queens. Commissioner Ray Kelly was right to ask last week for an independent review of how police use their firearms. It is also time to take a closer look at how to improve the department's response to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates questionable police conduct.\n        The Budget. Mr. Bloomberg, who inherited multibillion-dollar budget gaps, now enjoys a surplus that could amount to more than a half billion dollars. This surplus is best applied toward future obligations, and should not be regarded as mad money to be used for reducing property taxes and unnecessary spending.\n        Affordable Housing. The Mayor and the City Council passed useful new legislation aimed at forcing developers to build more units for low- and middle-income New Yorkers if they wanted certain tax breaks provided by law. The task now is to win Albany's approval before the law expires at the end of the year.\n        The Poor.  About one-fifth of New Yorkers live below the poverty line. The Mayor has committed $150 million to his antipoverty program, but he could also make a huge difference by insuring that people who are eligible for food stamps actually get them by easing their way through the bureaucratic maze.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1776534,"ids":1776534,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"It's emblematic of the low state of affairs in Bridgeport when what passes for good news is the fact that Mayor John Fabrizi passed a random drug test. When challenged, Mayor Fabrizi took the test to prove that he had not recently used illicit drugs, notably cocaine. He acknowledged last month that he had used cocaine as mayor, but said that he had been drug-free for 18 months.\n        But passing one drug test does not put to rest questions about the mayor's fitness for office. Nor does it keep people from wondering whether the revelations about his drug use have so damaged his credibility that he can no longer effectively lead. That's one reason the Bridgeport City Council president, Andres Ayala Jr., has appointed a council committee to examine possible responses, ranging from strengthening the municipal ethics code to publicly censuring the mayor.\n        Mr. Ayala will soon learn, if he hasn't already, that actually removing Mr. Fabrizi through a recall procedure will not be one of the options, unless the state legislature suddenly comes to the rescue.\n        Recall should by all rights be available to Bridgeport or any other community faced with urgent reasons -- and just cause -- to dispense with its existing leadership. Unfortunately, though, the state, when it last revised Connecticut's constitution in the 1960's, stripped communities of the right to recall their chief elected officials.\n        The courts have allowed five cities and towns to keep the recall power because it was in their charters before the constitutional change. But Bridgeport and 163 other cities and towns in the state are out of luck.\n        New England honors the right of the people to call town meetings and wreak havoc, if they see fit, with local budgets and other issues. But, paradoxically, when it comes to throwing the bums out, residents in Connecticut have to wait until election time.\n        As Stonington discovered, that is not always a reasonable option. In 2004, the borough's first selectman, with 18 months left in his term, was arrested for sexual misconduct with a child. He agreed to resign only after the town paid him $75,000, which infuriated many residents. But without recall authority, the town had little other choice.\n        State Representative Christopher L. Caruso, Democrat of Bridgeport, has argued vigorously on behalf of legislation to give all towns in Connecticut the right of recall, so far without success.\n        Mr. Caruso should keep trying, especially since he, as chairman of the Government Administration and Elections Committee, is in the best position to promote such a bill. Given the disturbing frequency with which elected officials, particularly mayors, are getting themselves in trouble in this state, the power of recall is beginning to seem more and more reasonable.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1695398,"ids":1695398,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It's getting harder and harder to disentangle the medical profession from financial conflicts of interest. The familiar concern has involved doctors who take money from pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for consulting or research. Such ties inevitably call into question how objective such doctors can be in conducting research, offering advice to government agencies or prescribing drugs for patients. It is never wholly clear whether the doctor is focused on the medical needs of patients or has one eye on the prospects of a financial patron.\n        Now, as described yesterday in an article by Stephanie Saul and Jenny Anderson in The Times, there is an additional concern: doctors who are paid to give advice to investment firms. The worry here is not that doctors will somehow shortchange their patients, but that their advice to financial firms may distort the markets, offering sophisticated investors the kind of insider information that the ordinary investor can't get.\n        With little notice or alarm, this form of financial consulting has expanded rapidly. An article on June 1 in The Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that almost 10 percent of the nation's 700,000 doctors had entered into formal consulting relations with the investment industry. The percentage of doctors from academic medical centers, where much of the clinical research of interest to investors takes place, was thought to be considerably higher.\n        The financial firms seeking advice include hedge funds, venture capital firms, investment bankers and stockbrokers, among others. They are assisted by specialized companies that enroll doctors and link them with information-hungry financial firms. A doctor is typically paid on an hourly basis -- at rates ranging from $200 to more than $1,000 per hour -- for consulting that can be done by telephone or face to face.\n        This kind of consulting looks like a recipe for trouble. The information most prized by investors is some hint as to how an experimental drug is performing in ongoing clinical trials or informed guidance about problems that may trouble the Food and Drug Administration. Although the doctors are routinely warned not to reveal confidential or proprietary information, it is a virtual certainty that when the scope of consulting is so large, there will be disclosures, even if they are inadvertent.\n        The best antidote would be a pledge of abstinence backed by the ethical guidelines of medical societies. Any doctor who has inside information about clinical trials or the F.D.A.'s thinking should not do consulting work for investment firms.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1759956,"ids":1759956,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It's hard to believe, but there are actually some very powerful people trying to junk one of the best laws passed by the New York State Legislature in the last three decades.

Since 1996, there have been three major official assessments of snowmobiles' impact on the park in winter. Two of those were done during the Bush administration. Now a fourth major study has been authorized; it is to be completed by 2007, when the current three-year plan for winter use comes to an end. This new study will cost $2 million to $3 million -- for a park that is annually underfinanced by nearly $23 million. There is only one conceivable reason for this study. It's part of the tried and true methodology of the Bush administration: if you don't like the results the first time, do it again and change the definitions so you do get the results you like.\n        The last three studies have determined, unequivocally, that snowcoaches are the environmentally preferred way to take visitors into Yellowstone National Park in the winter. Yet a draft of a new report, commissioned by the Interior Department and completed last month, purports to show that the new four-stroke snowmobiles are cleaner than snowcoaches. It does this by comparing the cleanest of the new snowmobiles with the existing snowcoach fleet. Since that includes some very old vehicles, the numbers don't look too good.\n        But when you compare the emissions of the new snowmobiles with those of the new snowcoaches, the numbers tell a very different story. The new snowcoaches have vastly lower emissions, and they have been increasingly adopted even by some die-hard West Yellowstone snowmobile operators. Clean snowcoaches are the fleet of the future.\n        Last winter, the average number of snowmobiles in the park was a little under 200 a day -- the low number was partly due to an early shortage of snow and to uncertainty about how many machines would be allowed. (The cap is now 720 per day.) All of those snowmobiles, including the one Interior Secretary Gale Norton rode in February, were guided in groups. The combination of using guides and having fewer machines had an immediate positive effect on the air quality and winter quiet of the park. But one of the alternatives being examined in the 2007 study is to allowing unguided snowmobiles into Yellowstone again.\n        The surrounding towns are discovering that tourists who come to enjoy the quiet of the park are as likely to spend money as those who come to roar across the snow. Both tourists and former snowmobile operators have discovered the benefits of the new snowcoaches, which include lower costs, greater comfort, better visibility and less disturbance for the animals. But when this administration sticks its head in the sand it means to keep it there, no matter what common sense, science or public opinion says.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1823663,"ids":1823663,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It's ludicrous, but true: Connecticut apparently needs a state law to force hospitals to provide rape victims with emergency contraception.\n        It would seem to be common sense to offer sexual assault victims the means to ensure that they do not become pregnant from an attack. Offering contraception is also standard medical procedure, endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians and other medical societies.\n        But it is not standard practice in Connecticut. According to a survey of rape cases during the first six months of 2006, conducted by nine rape crisis centers, about 4 in 10 victims said they were not offered emergency contraception at hospitals where they sought treatment, nor were they offered the full, two-pill dose of the so-called morning after pill that is required for maximum effectiveness.\n        This year, like last year, lawmakers have proposed a measure that would require medical centers to offer such contraception. This would seem to be a no-brainer. But last year the measure became controversial and did not even come up for a vote in the General Assembly, nor was it reported out of the Joint Committee on Public Health.\n        One big reason was that the Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford opposed the bill, saying that it would force the state's four Catholic hospitals to violate church teaching against birth control and represented a violation of religious freedom. Many lawmakers were reluctant to oppose the archdiocese in an election year. Yet the Archdiocese of Hartford's position against emergency contraception is more conservative than that of many other Catholic dioceses, notably those in New York and New Jersey. Even the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, in its \"Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services,\" explicitly allows Catholic hospitals, as a matter of compassion, to give rape victims contraception.\n        In Connecticut, if a rape victim at a Catholic hospital is ovulating, increasing the possibility that she could have become pregnant by her attacker, the hospital will not give her the ''morning after'' pill. Yet offering a victim such contraception should be standard procedure in secular and religious hospitals alike, and if that takes a law, so be it. More than 1,000 rape victims sought help at Connecticut hospitals last year. As a matter of human dignity and compassion, those who endure an ugly and horrific crime should be able to expect complete medical care no matter what hospitals they turn to after being attacked.\n        The Public Health Committee has until mid-February to approve this year's bill.

Jon Corzine was forced to get rid of his attorney general, Zulima Farber, after she interceded when local police stopped her companion for a driving infraction. Mr. Corzine had appointed Ms. Farber despite her very public history of ignoring traffic summonses.\n        In similar fashion, former Gov. James McGreevey's chose Joseph Santiago as superintendent of the New Jersey State police even though Mr. Santiago had a conviction, later overturned, for abusive treatment of a subordinate. Mr. Santiago was later forced to resign amid reports that he managed in a heavy-handed style and was friendly with an organized crime figure.\n        So it is perplexing that Newark's new mayor, the reformer Cory Booker, seems to have paid so little attention to a troublesome incident involving Garry McCarthy, his choice for Newark police director. In February 2005, after one of his daughters called him from a rest stop on the Palisades Interstate Parkway to complain about a parking ticket, Mr. McCarthy, a much-decorated deputy police commissioner in New York City, drove to the site and confronted two officers who had handed out the ticket. A shouting match followed, and one officer handcuffed Mr. McCarthy while the other took his handgun. Mr. McCarthy was charged with -- and later convicted of -- obstructing traffic. (His wife, who had accompanied him, was convicted of making ''unreasonable noise'' for shouting obscenities at the officers.)\n        Last month, a Superior Court judge rejected Mr. McCarthy's effort to have his conviction dismissed and scolded him for trying to ''throw his weight around.'' Mr. Booker is playing down the incident and standing fully behind his nominee. A spokesman for the mayor said Mr. Booker was convinced that this was just one incident in an otherwise ''outstanding'' record, including his performance with New York's police force.\n        But equally important is how an officer conducts himself while off duty. An officer is expected to defuse potentially explosive situations, not create them. And he is not supposed to use the power of his badge to gain special treatment for a member of his family.\n        The Newark Municipal Council is scheduled to consider Mr. McCarthy's appointment on Wednesday. It should reject it. Better yet, Mr. Booker should live up to his campaign promise of high standards for his administration and withdraw the nomination.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1708815,"ids":1708815,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It's not every day that Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Finance Committee, blasts the White House. But it happened last Thursday, and we hope that the administration got the message.\n        The occasion was a committee hearing on using the tax code to rebuild after a disaster. Mr. Grassley accused the White House of trying to kill his measure to pay for health care for those poor and uninsured Katrina victims who are not eligible for Medicaid, such as childless adults and pregnant women with incomes modestly above the normal -- very low -- cutoff. ''The White House is working against me behind the scenes, and I resent that, considering how I have worked for the White House in the past several years,'' Mr. Grassley said.\n        Coming from a heartland Republican whose support will be pivotal for passing the additional tax cuts the administration craves, the comment was especially loaded. We hope that Mr. Grassley exercises his influence -- and not just to rush much-needed medical care to Katrina victims.\n        At the hearing, Treasury Secretary John Snow and Jack Kemp, the former congressman and vice-presidential nominee, both promoted ''enterprise zones'' to rebuild devastated areas. These are places where the government offers sizable write-offs, presumably to lure big companies and encourage small business.\n        The trouble is that most research on existing zones -- including evidence submitted at the hearing by the Congressional Research Service -- shows that they generally reward wealthy investors and businesses with a tax windfall for investments they would have made anyway, while failing to have much of an effect on growth and employment. Moreover, write-offs are of no help to businesses that are so strapped that they have no tax liability. Think of most of the enterprises in Katrina-ravaged areas.\n        Other so-called tax solutions are even more dubious. Before Katrina, Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, was the point man for repeal of the estate tax. That effort has been shelved for now, but Mr. Kyl's big contribution to the Katrina recovery has been to support measures to eliminate taxes on investments and estates in the affected areas. Currently, tax breaks for dividends and capital gains flow mostly to people who make six figures or more; estate taxes don't even apply unless an estate exceeds $1.5 million. The areas hit by Katrina are among the poorest in the nation, so it's hard to see Mr. Kyl's idea as anything but an attempt to advance a preset agenda.\n        Tax policy should get a relatively low priority in restoring the Gulf Coast, which will be hard for this administration and some of its diehard supporters to accept. But Mr. Grassley made it clear: health care comes first. Housing vouchers and bolstered unemployment compensation should also come before any discussion of tax breaks.\n        If lawmakers are worried about paying for those measures, they should simply let President Bush's temporary tax cuts for the rich expire as scheduled.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1712276,"ids":1712276,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"It's surprising just how few chairmen of the Federal Reserve there have been in the last half-century: five, to be exact.\n        President Harry Truman appointed the blueblood William McChesney Martin Jr. back in 1951, and he served for almost 19 years. The disastrous tenure of Arthur Burns included interest rates that were kept obscenely low to help Richard Nixon get re-elected in 1972 and that led to the out-of-control inflation that characterized the 1970's. Jimmy Carter's choice to succeed Mr. Burns was hardly any better: the lackluster G. William Miller was gone in just over a year.\n        That decade of monetary ineptitude finally ended with Mr. Carter's 1979 appointment of Paul Volcker, who took over the country's central banking system at a time when inflation was a whopping 14.8 percent. Mr. Volcker heroically tightened credit, sending the country into recession but knocking inflation down to 4.4 percent by the time he left, in 1987. We need not list the accomplishments of Alan Greenspan. Some fumbles aside, like intruding into a political debate to back President Bush's ill-conceived tax cuts, he will be known as one of the most influential central bankers ever.\n        And now Mr. Bush has appointed the chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers, Ben Bernanke, to succeed Mr. Greenspan. Given that this is the same president who, just this year alone, appointed John Bolton, the radical anti-multilateralist, to be ambassador to the United Nations, and the White House counsel, Harriet Miers, to the Supreme Court, it is small wonder that markets and economists and everyone else were fretting that Mr. Bush might conjure up an ill-suited political pal for the Fed. Some of the names floating around, including Lawrence Lindsey, the former director of the White House National Economic Council, were downright frightening.\n        But wait. Mr. Bush may have just picked the best person for the job. Mr. Bernanke is not the sort of inner-circle member that Mr. Bush clearly prefers for big posts. An Ivy League economist and monetary theorist, he has worked closely with the White House only since June, when he was sworn in at the economic council. For three years before that, he was a governor at the Federal Reserve, where he was viewed as a superb monetary economist who won over financial markets. A star professor at Princeton, Mr. Bernanke is considered a very good communicator; at the Fed, he reached out to junior staff economists in cafeteria seminars.\n        Though conservative, Mr. Bernanke is independent, critics and allies say, a trait critical for this job. His biggest weakness is a lack of Wall Street experience, an area where Mr. Greenspan excelled. Beyond shoring up those credentials, Mr. Bernanke will have to show bond markets that he can tackle inflation.\n        Clearly, Mr. Bernanke will have a tough job filling Mr. Greenspan's shoes.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has changed its mind and decided to allow Shelter Island and parts of Fire Island to install four-poster deer-feeding stations, which coat the heads and necks of deer with a pesticide that kills the ticks that carry Lyme disease.\n        The problem with Lyme disease and other tick-borne afflictions is that methods to prevent them tend to be indirect, time consuming, prohibitively expensive or distasteful. Ticks live on deer, and subduing deer is ferociously difficult. Deer-infested communities have spent years trying any number of approaches to keep them at bay, like recreational hunting and birth control, with dubious results. One strategy is to slaughter the deer, but many people hate that, and even if you turned every last suburban Bambi into steaks and sausage, you would not necessarily subdue the parasitic arachnid that is at the root of this growing problem.\n        The four-poster device takes a different, lethally direct approach that offers some hope, at least in controlled circumstances. It was developed by a federal agriculture official and works by luring deer to a bin baited with corn kernels and rigged with rollers soaked with permethrin, a tick-killing pesticide. The deer eats and rubs against the rollers, and ticks die by the thousands. One station can treat all the deer in about 100 acres.\n        New York bans four-poster devices because the Department of Environmental Conservation is not convinced that they are safe or effective; the department also opposes feeding wild deer. Feeding deer makes them congregate, which increases the risk of spreading chronic wasting disease.\n        We agree that it is generally a terrible idea to feed deer -- or any wild creatures with a tendency to multiply uncontrollably. This is not only out of pity for chronically wasting deer, but because of the dangers that dependent deer pose to people, who drive into them on highways, and the damage that swelling herds of emboldened nibblers do to gardens, parks and woods.\n        But if feeding deer is a bad idea in general, it could be a very good one in isolated places like Shelter Island and Fire Island, where the herds are separated from the rest of the state deer population and where Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses constitute a genuine public health emergency.\n        A controlled experiment that directs a focused assault on ticks makes perfect sense, and is a well-deserved victory for the island residents who relentlessly pressured town and village officials to drop their resistance to four-poster devices. Credit should also go to Gov. George Pataki, who issued the order clearing the way for the four-poster study last month after being urged to do so in a letter from former Gov. Hugh Carey, a Shelter Islander who knows the problem well.\n        The next step is to pay up. New York State, Suffolk County and town and village officials on Shelter and Fire Islands should come up with funds to augment the private contributions that are even now being raised to finance the four-poster study. The tick scourge has gone on too long, and this should be the beginning of the end.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1773206,"ids":1773206,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"It's unfortunate that the prolonged struggle over Mamaroneck's crackdown on its day laborers has been prolonged even further. The village and the civil-rights group representing the workers spent six weeks trying to settle their differences, but the talks collapsed last week, and a federal judge ordered everyone back for a trial in September. Now a court will have to drag both sides to a resolution that should have been arrived at months ago.\n        No one can question the village's right to impose orderliness on its ad-hoc day labor marketplace. Any large congregation in a public area -- of workers, cars, trucks, school buses, protesters, picnickers, whatever -- creates a potential challenge for the people elected or hired to maintain public order. They have to ensure safety and efficiency without trampling on people's rights, a trick that can usually be pulled off through the application of modest amounts of common sense and good will.\n        But the lawsuit, filed by the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund on behalf of six unnamed workers, contends that the village went drastically overboard in its attempts to rein in the day laborers who met regularly on the edges of Columbus Park, near the Metro-North station, to look for work. The suit charges that heavy-handed police tactics -- involving officers doing lots of looming, shadowing and ticketing -- had denied the workers' constitutional rights to free speech and assembly.\n        It may sound odd to invoke the First Amendment on behalf of people presumed -- though not proven -- to be illegal immigrants. But federal courts in other cases involving day-labor crackdowns in places like Redondo Beach, Calif., have upheld the rights of people, even undocumented ones, to look for work in public places.\n        The village of Mamaroneck may not have been looking for a constitutional showdown. But that's what it has gotten. And while it will be interesting to see how the court rules on the First Amendment question, the trial will likely provide no solace to village residents who have grown weary of the day-labor debate, especially if it results in a return to the hostile status quo.\n        The proliferation of day laborers around the country represents the nation's immigration system at its most chaotic. Street-corner labor markets are prone to unsightliness, unruliness and danger -- not least for the laborers themselves. But unlike swarming insects, to which the Mamaroneck workers have been compared, the men who are now gathering on Mamaroneck Avenue are human beings who only want to make a living and stay out of trouble.

It failed to cancel outgoing flights that were unable to take off while it allowed incoming flights to keep landing -- creating gridlock at its gates. Meanwhile, some planes' wheels froze to the ground along with the equipment that moves and de-ices them.\n        The same lean organization that has allowed JetBlue to keep fares low collapsed under the strain. The airline ended up with large numbers of pilots and flight attendants far from where they were needed. Crew members who tried to call in failed to get through an overwhelmed communications system. The understaffed reservations system could not handle the flood of calls from passengers trying to figure out whether to go to the airport.\n        JetBlue seems desperately eager to make amends before it loses a huge chunk of its customers. It has said it will add staff members and improve training. It has also issued a ''Customer Bill of Rights,'' which would compensate passengers kept waiting by the airline's own mistakes (including those affected by the recent ice storm) and allow passengers to get off planes if grounded for more than five hours.\n        That's a start but not enough. The code is voluntary and applies only to JetBlue, whereas other airlines have also treated passengers abusively. Last December, American Airlines kept passengers trapped aboard a diverted plane for more than eight hours -- an incident of such notoriety that American now pledges to let passengers off after four hours.\n        Senators Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, and Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, have introduced a bill that would require that passengers be provided with adequate food and water and sanitary bathrooms while delayed on the ground and be allowed to leave the plane after three hours. Representative Mike Thompson, also a California Democrat, will introduce a bill that would also require airlines to update passengers frequently on the cause and timing of delays. Both proposals would be strengthened if they required the Transportation Department to impose suitable fines or passenger compensation should an airline fail to comply.\n        Although the airline industry continues to oppose government intervention, Congress needs to ensure that passengers have the right to escape involuntary confinement, to be adequately fed and cared for, and to receive timely and accurate information about their prospects for taking off. These needs seem so basic it is hard to see why they should not be mandatory.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1657030,"ids":1657030,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Medell\u00edn, a Mexican on death row in Texas, has been a problem for the Bush administration. In response, the White House has taken a step that could imperil American tourists or business travelers if they are ever arrested and need the help of a consular official.\n        Mr. Medell\u00edn was arrested for a gang-related killing at 18 and assigned a lawyer, who, unbeknownst to the court, had been suspended from the bar for ethics violations. He called not a single witness at Mr. Medell\u00edn's trial and only one in the penalty phase that ended with a sentence of death. Mexico's consular representatives learned of Mr. Medell\u00edn's case only when he had been on death row for three years. Mexican authorities argued that if Mr. Medell\u00edn had been able to notify them at the time of his arrest, he might have had competent representation at his trial. This month, the Supreme Court will hear Mr. Medell\u00edn's petition.\n        But meanwhile, the issue of Mr. Medell\u00edn's access to consular help was addressed last year by the International Court of Justice, sometimes known as the World Court, the United Nations' top court for resolving disputes between countries. In a case brought by Mexico, the court said Mr. Medell\u00edn and 50 other Mexicans on death row in the United States should get new hearings because they were not given access to consular officials, as required by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which Washington has been a signatory for decades.\n        The administration surprised everyone at first by accepting the court's judgment and supporting Mr. Medell\u00edn's right to review. It said, in what seemed like a promising change of heart, that ''consular assistance is a vital safeguard for Americans abroad'' and that if America did not comply with the court ruling, ''its ability to secure such assistance could be adversely affected.''\n        That was good reasoning. It applied in 1963 when the United States itself designed the optional protocol, the part of the Vienna Convention that allows the World Court to hear disputes over consular access. It applied in 1979 when America became the first country to use the protocol by successfully suing Iran for taking American hostages. Now, in a climate of global hostility toward Americans, the right to consular help is all the more important.\n        But this administration is not always given to sound reasoning when it comes to institutions like the World Court -- especially on red-meat issues like the death penalty. Last week, just days after accepting the court's judgment, the administration revealed its hand: it said it had withdrawn from the optional protocol. Apparently forgetting its concern about citizens arrested abroad, the State Department said it wanted to end the court's meddling in the American judicial system.\n        In other words, ideology triumphed over sound judgment and Americans abroad are all less secure as a result.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1774986,"ids":1774986,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"July 1 was a good day for lobsters. That was the day that more stringent catch limits in Long Island Sound took effect, increasing by one thirty-second of an inch the legal size required for fishermen to keep the crustaceans. That seems like a tiny step, but it is another one toward helping the population in its slow recovery since 1999, the year thousands of lobsters in the Sound died.\n        A rise in water temperatures after a storm, overfishing and pesticides have been blamed for the die-off. Since peaking in 1998, the population has dropped by an astonishing 80 percent. But lobsters are just one piece of the interconnected puzzle that is Long Island Sound. Restoring them to health is one skirmish in a larger environmental struggle in which enemies seem to come out of nowhere.\n        A case in point is the coastal salt marshes, which have been dying off in many parts of the Sound for the last seven or eight years. The phenomenon, known as sudden wetlands die-back, has turned parts of Connecticut's 10,000 acres of coastal salt marshes, once teeming with birds, fish and cordgrass, into muddy moonscapes.\n        The marshes are important. Besides being beautiful, they reduce coastal erosion, filter pollution from water and support the Sound's intricate ecosystem. Ron Rozsa, a coastal ecologist for the state's Department of Environmental Protection, says he has been trying since 2002 to attract federal attention to the issue, without much success. Scientists have reported examples of the die-back in all the New England states, along the Atlantic Seaboard and in the gulf states.\n        Fewer acres of salt marshes mean fewer areas for marine life to grow. Some populations of fish are struggling significantly, like winter flounder, which has decreased 85 percent over a 20-year period. Even more pronounced is the drop in blueback herring, a type of river herring. Ten years ago scientists counted about 100,000 of the fish making their way through fish ladders on dams. This spring they counted a mere 22 in the Connecticut River.\n        It's not all gloom and doom. Twenty years ago, striped bass were depleted, too. The entire Atlantic Seaboard imposed strict limits. Now striped bass have become the big success story of the last 10 years. But they are voracious predators, and they feast upon -- what else? -- baby lobster, river herring and flounder. Cormorants, birds that became rare in Connecticut, have been protected for decades, and they, too, eat small fish.\n        For some of this, nature has to find its own balance, and the watchword has become ecosystem management rather than focusing on one species. ''No one in his right mind would suggest overfishing bass to get back river herring,'' said Eric Smith, director of marine fisheries for the Department of Environmental Protection.\n        But on other issues, we cannot afford to sit back. Connecticut's Congressional delegation should insist that the federal government help underwrite research into the die-back, which so far has attracted few federal dollars. Possible causes run from the mundane to the exotic, including a rise in the amount of African dust that wind currents deposit in North America.\n        The die-back makes cooperation between New York and Connecticut -- on improving sewage treatment plants and reducing pollution, for instance -- even more important. In the end, what is good for lobster, cordgrass, river herring and flounder is good for the entire Sound.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":22,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1844250,"ids":1844250,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Just about everyone who works pays taxes into the fund for federal disability benefits. But mercifully, relatively few people ever collect. To qualify, you must be unable to work, and your disability must be of such severity that you'll be out for at least a year or you're likely to die from it.\n        Those criteria are tough but necessary to ensure that resources go to the neediest Americans. In the past several years, however, another hurdle has been erected, one that is unacceptable and inhumane. Processing delays, mounting since 2000, have left more than one million applicants languishing without help, some for years.\n        The most acute bottlenecks are at the appeals level, where the average processing time is now 515 days -- compared with 274 days in 2000. Such delays are especially pernicious because slightly more than one-quarter of all approved claims are awarded after an appeal hearing, and nearly two-thirds of the people who appeal ultimately prevail. Without the benefits they are entitled to, far too many applicants get sicker and experience severe economic hardship, including foreclosures and even homelessness. Some applicants die before their appeals are heard.\n        The fault lies primarily with Congress. For many years, lawmakers have consistently cut into the budget for the Social Security Administration, which administers the disability program. Since 2000, the cumulative shortfall -- the difference between what the agency has asked for and what Congress has appropriated -- is $4.4 billion, with more than $2 billion of that in the last few years.\n        In the same period, demands on the agency have grown, resulting in a chronic shortage of people to do the work. Disability claims have risen, to 2.5 million in 2006 from 1.3 million in 2000, driven in part by the aging of the population. Disability claims also tend to rise when jobs are scarce, as was the case during much of the Bush-era economic expansion. Research shows that people who would tough out their disabilities during good times turn to government aid when they lose their jobs and are unable to find new ones. Congress has also recently imposed new tasks on the Social Security Administration, like assisting with immigration issues.\n        You get what you pay for. When it comes to helping disabled workers -- as with so many other duties of government -- recent Congresses have not been willing to pay for service that is prompt, professional and compassionate.\n        The agency generally gets high marks for productivity and efficiency, and estimates that it needs about $10.5 billion a year to be able to do its work adequately. The current Congress can begin to fix the disability program by providing the needed funds in the coming budget for 2008. Congress must also work closely with the new commissioner of Social Security, Michael Astrue, to ensure that a plausible plan to conquer the backlog is put in place quickly.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1804518,"ids":1804518,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Just as the summer driving season was winding down, oil prices started to fall. The combination of less demand and lower prices was a potent mix, helping to narrow the United States' trade gap significantly in September, to $64.3 billion from $69 billion in August, according to the latest tally.\n        That's welcome news, illustrating yet another upside to curbing the nation's oil consumption. But it's also sobering. The decline in September's trade deficit was the largest in nearly two years. And yet, the United States remains squarely on track for a record trade imbalance in 2006: a projected $790 billion, compared with $717 billion last year.\n        The Bush administration has played down the dangers of bloated deficits. Acknowledging them would compel an effort to tame the borrow-and-spend ways of the past six years, including curbing the tax cuts that have been such a boon to the rich.\n        Far too many Congressional Democrats have blamed China's cheap currency for the trade deficit and sought a solution in protectionism. The currency complaint has a grain of truth, but it is overly simplistic and could be self-defeating if it led to global protectionism.\n        So, both camps are off point. With the deficit reaching new highs and Democrats now able to wield real power, it is crucial that each side back off its constituent-pleasing myths.\n        The Bush administration needs to tell the truth about the vulnerability that comes with large deficits. Thus far, the United States has had no problem attracting money from abroad to plug the gaps. But there is no guarantee that will continue indefinitely. If foreigners chose to invest elsewhere -- like the strengthening economies of Europe or Japan -- the result would be higher interest rates and higher prices in America, perhaps sharply higher.\n        The Democrats need to take a more pragmatic view of the lopsided trade situation. The surest way to make American businesses more competitive -- and workers more secure -- is to resolve the nation's health care mess. And the government needs to update and strengthen the safety net for workers who are hurt by global competition. As recently as a few years ago, economists warned that a nation was courting a financial crisis if the size of its trade deficit exceeded 3 percent of its economy. Today, the United States' deficit is approaching 7 percent. The best way to avoid the worst is to define the problem honestly, and craft the remedies accordingly.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1754767,"ids":1754767,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Just as things seemed to be calming down in the delta region of Nigeria after a spate of kidnappings and insurgent attacks, the militant group calling itself the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta -- MEND -- announced last week to all who would listen that it was planning new violence against oil facilities in the region. Apparently unconcerned about tipping its hand to the authorities, MEND even gave a date for the start of its new campaign: April 25.\n        The guerrillas could not have hoped for a better reaction. Crude oil prices immediately jumped on the news, hitting $70 a barrel, as new fears about a supply squeeze hit the global oil market. Adding to the concern is that the latest message, sent to various news organizations, seems a lot angrier and more violent than previous missives. The references to endless buckets of blood sounded more like an Al Qaeda rant than a threat from oil-market saboteurs.\n        This really should serve notice to Olusegun Obasanjo, president of Africa's most populous country, Nigeria. MEND's tactics -- kidnapping oil workers, attacking facilities, killing government soldiers -- are despicable, and deserve international condemnation. But the demand for more local control over oil wealth cannot be dismissed just because of its source.\n        Ever since Royal Dutch Shell discovered oil in the Niger Delta back in 1956, revenue from oil wells has gone to line the pockets of Nigeria's elite: military dictators and corrupt federal and local government officials. Very little has gone to help the impoverished communities in the delta, which remain among the poorest in the world. Environment degradation, caused by oil slicks and gas flares, has gone untreated.\n        Under Nigerian law, oil revenues go to the federal government, which then passes on a percentage to the states. In 2004, for instance, the 36 Nigerian states received $6.2 billion. Supposedly, about one-third of that went to the four major oil-producing states. But thanks to theft, corruption and mismanagement, on both the federal and state levels, very little of that money reached the local communities.\n        Traveling through the delta region, it is difficult to comprehend that this is actually an area wealthy in natural resources. Despite generating hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue since oil was discovered, the Niger Delta is one of the poorest and least developed parts of the country. A Wall Street Journal article last week described Warri, the western delta's oil capital, as a ''crime-ridden sprawl of rutted streets and cinderblock shops.'' Lydia Polgreen of The Times reported earlier this year on Obioku, an impoverished delta village that is completely isolated. ''With no fast boats available, the nearest health center or clinic is a day's journey away,'' Ms. Polgreen wrote. ''No telephone service exists here. Radio brings the only news of the world outside. Nothing hints that the people here live in a nation enjoying the profits of record-high oil prices.''\n        It is time for Nigeria's government to begin taking into account the plight of the people who live around the oil wells that have sustained the country for so long.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1795084,"ids":1795084,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Just before it made tracks out of town, the Senate confirmed Mary Bomar's appointment as the new head of the National Park Service. Ms. Bomar testified in person in late September before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, but the bulk of her testimony took the form of written answers to written questions posed by members of the committee. Her answers were intently managerial in tone -- not particularly evasive and not particularly helpful.\n        At one point, for instance, Ms. Bomar was asked to list the ''three greatest challenges facing the Park Service.'' Number one, she said, is ''re-energizing the support of the American people,'' and number three is ''preparing a new generation of leadership.'' (Two is improving the park service's ''capabilities.'')\n        In reality, the biggest challenge facing the service is to take politics out of parks management. Again and again over the past six years, demoralized career park service employees have been forced to watch sensible decisions overturned or bad decisions made on a political basis. They have witnessed a brazen attempt to break the parks wide open in favor of commercial interests. They've seen the integrity of park service science compromised and its results disregarded.\n        If Ms. Bomar can put the national park system back on a sound managerial footing, she will not need to re-energize the support of the American people.\n        There are a lot of ways Ms. Bomar could set a new tone and demonstrate her commitment to apolitical good management. One opportunity involves the problem of snowmobiles in Yellowstone. Ms. Bomar said recent experience has demonstrated that snowmobiles ''may be operated without unacceptable impacts to park resources and visitors'' under the current limits and requirements. That is exactly what has not happened.\n        For the past two winters, snowmobile numbers have been running about 250 a day in Yellowstone -- roughly a third of the maximum allowed under a temporary plan. Even that smaller number exceeds the weakened noise standards established by the Bush administration in 2003, and the National Park Service has rejected two environmental impact statements that find the presence of snowmobiles in Yellowstone unacceptable.\n        But Senator Conrad Burns, who is facing a tough battle for re-election in Montana, has proposed legislation that would force the park to continue admitting up to 720 snowmobiles a day and strip the courts of their ability to rule on the issue. It is a classic face-off between the forces of politics and parks stewardship. Ms. Bomar had a chance to send a message about her intention to manage impartially, in her written responses. She missed the opportunity.\n        The Interior Department has recently approved a strong set of management policies that put preservation first. Ms. Bomar would do well to put those policies first and put an end, at last, to snowmobiles in Yellowstone.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1659240,"ids":1659240,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Just weeks ago, the New York Jets made a take-it-or-take-it offer of $100 million for rights to build a stadium over the railyards on Manhattan's Far West Side. The rights belong to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the region's beleaguered mass transit system. The offer was only a fraction of the appraised value, and you'd have thought Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Gov. George Pataki -- who understand the M.T.A.'s problems but have not been particularly helpful about solutions -- would have been outraged. But both men seem more interested in getting that stadium built than in protecting the commuting public.\n        The M.T.A. was forced to open the bidding, and the Jets have now offered a package of $720 million. That should be reason enough to ask why top elected officials weren't more aggressive earlier. But even now, it is still far from clear that the deal is a fair one for the authority and the city.\n        The team's bid includes $440 million from a half dozen developers who would use part of the development rights to build other projects, mainly housing. But that part of the offer is contingent on rezoning the proposed stadium site for residential use and allowing transfer of the rights to the surrounding area. That is far from a sure thing, given competing plans for residential projects on the Far West Side.\n        Further, the Jets are still expecting at least $600 million in city and state assistance to build a platform over the yards and a roof for the stadium. That's an enormous amount of public money for a team playing in one of the most lucrative sports markets on the globe. The Jets have also been assured of getting the zoning needed for the stadium and that the team won't have to pay the freight if there turn out to be environmental problems at the site that need to be fixed. These sweeteners, which considerably detract from the value of the team's offer, were not available to other bidders.\n        Small wonder, then, that there were only three bids. The only one other than the Jets' that has a fighting chance came from the stadium project's archenemy, Cablevision, which owns Madison Square Garden. If nothing else, the company deserves credit for helping the M.T.A. see the light and encouraging the public to ask questions about the entire stadium deal.\n        Cablevision made its initial offer of $600 million -- including the cost of constructing a platform -- last month. That helped to prompt the authority's chairman, Peter Kalikow, to look beyond the Jets. But the bidding took place on grounds that were far from even -- only the Jets were assured they would have no problems with zoning or environmental concerns. The authority, beset with crushing debt, an aging and ailing subway system in the city and the need to finance its multibillion-dollar capital plan, missed what could have been a golden opportunity.\n        Mr. Bloomberg's desire to jump-start development on the Far West Side is laudable, but we still doubt the stadium can accomplish that. There's no need for the M.T.A. board to rush to select a bid, as planned, at the end of the month. Finding a best price and highest use for the site may yet be possible, but only if the process is made truly open and fair.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1841158,"ids":1841158,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Just when it looked as if the Iraqi government had sunk as low as it could go, it sank still further, following a brazen power play by Moktada al-Sadr.\n        Until now Mr. Sadr, a virulently anti-American cleric with an unquenchable appetite for attention and power, had been Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's strongest political ally. But on Monday, at his direction, his party's six ministers quit the Maliki cabinet. The government still depends on the parliamentary votes of Mr. Sadr's party, the largest faction in the ruling Shiite bloc.\n        Mr. Maliki, a colorless and ineffective politician, has been prime minister for the past year. But from the beginning, his authority has depended on the backing of Mr. Sadr, a charismatic demagogue with an intimidating private army, a potent political party and an impressive capacity for sending his followers into the street.\n        Mr. Maliki had probably figured that he was better off having Mr. Sadr's party inside his cabinet, demanding patronage for its followers and official protection for its rampaging private militia, than outside, publicly challenging government policies, including Mr. Maliki's support for a continued American military presence in Iraq.\n        Now Mr. Maliki may be about to experience the worst of both options. Mr. Sadr had his cabinet ministers resign in an attempt to bully the government into setting a timetable for the departure of American troops from Iraq. Mr. Maliki cannot just say no, because if Mr. Sadr's party turns against him, he could lose his parliamentary majority. Nor can he just say yes because the physical survival of his administration probably still depends on those American troops. Meanwhile, Mr. Sadr has aligned himself with a highly popular cause that is likely to expand his following even further.\n        This squeeze play leaves the Bush administration holding what looks like an even weaker political hand in Baghdad than it held before. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, now traveling through the region pleading with Arab leaders to ignore their misgivings about the Maliki government's performance, is gamely trying to sell the idea that the departure of the Sadr ministers, and their likely replacement by politically neutral technocrats, could actually help stabilize the Iraqi government.\n        But technocratic caretaking will scarcely be enough, especially with Mr. Sadr inciting division from the sidelines. The American military drive in Baghdad has yet to show significant results. But even if it did, any security gains would be quickly erased without a series of decisive moves by the Iraqi government. These include sharing political power and economic resources with the Sunni minority, shutting down sectarian militias, and creating security forces committed to protect all Iraqis.\n        That will require political will and authority, not mere administrative competence. Mr. Maliki displayed neither before Mr. Sadr's latest power play. He seems even less likely to display them now.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1640915,"ids":1640915,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Kofi Annan has two problems -- the Bush administration's continuing annoyance with the United Nations and the organization's actual, pressing problems in fulfilling its key missions. In a perfect world, Washington would encourage Mr. Annan to focus on the second and work with him later on the first, but the U.N. exists in a highly imperfect world.\n        So, the secretary general is doing the right thing by planning additional management changes beyond his announcement that his retiring chief of staff would be replaced by a dynamic specialist on development and public communications. Further changes are certainly warranted, as is the newly announced tracking system for tsunami relief. But the housecleaning should not just be aimed at appeasing Washington and improving the United Nations' public image. Major shakeups are needed in critical areas like peacekeeping and refugee assistance.\n        It is no secret that a re-elected Bush administration would like to force out several highly competent officials who have disagreed with it over Iraq or other sensitive issues. Some may have to go, however unfairly, since the United Nations cannot do its very necessary work -- from helping tsunami victims to delivering on the promise of real help for the billions trapped in absolute poverty -- without at least minimal cooperation from Washington.\n        But helping the poor and the desperate also demands strengthening the management of peacekeeping operations. Some kind of appalling nadir was reached last month with reports that members of an international contingent of U.N. peacekeepers in Congo had been raping the young girls they had been sent to protect. Mr. Annan and his staff must spare no effort to see that these crimes are prosecuted and punished. Further steps must be taken so that adequately armed and trained troops are quickly available to back up truce agreements in the world's multiplying trouble spots. The peacekeeping department's current head, Jean-Marie Gu\u00e9henno, is generally considered up to the job, but he has not been given enough money or staff.\n        Sweeping changes are also needed at the United Nations refugee agency that is responsible for protecting the interests of some 17 million people worldwide who have been forced from their homes by armed conflict or fear of persecution. Not only has the current high commissioner, Ruud Lubbers, performed uninspiringly, but his relations with his staff have been embittered by a charge of sexual harassment. Although an internal U.N. investigation found some basis for these claims, the complainant withdrew formal charges and Mr. Lubbers says he intends to finish his term, which ends in December. He should be asked to leave now.\n        Given the unremitting hostility of the Bush administration, the U.N.'s survival as an effective organization cannot be taken for granted.

But if the U.N. is to recover from its recent serial batterings and start promoting economic and social development, fighting nuclear proliferation and nurturing democracy, bold reforms are needed right away.\n        Secretary General Kofi Annan has begun that process by calling on member states to approve a wide range of reforms at a special General Assembly meeting this September. We strongly endorse Mr. Annan's agenda, especially his call for developed countries to establish timetables for living up to their promises to commit 0.7 percent of their gross national incomes to development aid by 2015 (the United States now contributes 0.18 percent) and for poor countries to come up with strategies for putting this aid to effective use. His proposals also take on the crucial issue of climate change, asking for a broad framework to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions after the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. This new agreement would include rich and poor countries, thus meeting one of Washington's major objections to the Kyoto approach.\n        Mr. Annan made useful recommendations addressing nuclear weapons proliferation, including a treaty to cut off production of fissile nuclear materials and strengthened inspections under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The treaty needs not just tougher inspections, but also new language tightening restrictions on uranium and plutonium processing plants that can be used to make bomb fuel.\n        On the organizational side, the proposals aim at eliminating one of the United Nations' great embarrassments, a Human Rights Commission whose seats have been filled by regional rotation, letting egregious violators of human rights like Cuba, Libya and Sudan sit in judgment of other countries' performance. In place of this, Mr. Annan proposes a more credible and authoritative human rights council chosen by a two-thirds vote of all member states. He also wants this to be the year the Security Council adds new members to better reflect the realities of today's world. The current lineup, particularly the five veto-wielding permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- emerged from the geopolitics of 1945, the year the U.N. was founded. Unfortunately, most specific plans for enlargement have problems of their own, with regional rivalries over who can best represent Africa, South Asia or Latin America.\n        Many of the problems that have tarnished the U.N.'s reputation in recent years have been self-inflicted, including the scandalous maladministration of the oil-for-food program and the sexual assaults committed by U.N. peacekeepers in Congo. But the overriding problem has been Washington's virtually unremitting hostility.

Louis Kincannon, and the deputy director, Hermann Habermann, abruptly decided to quit, acknowledging tensions with their bosses in the Bush administration but giving no other details. Both men are statisticians who had served in their positions since 2002 and, before that, had decades of experience as civil servants.\n        The leadership problems -- on top of severe budget cuts -- threaten to throw the preparations for the 2010 census into disarray. At stake is the accuracy of the next count and, with it, the legitimacy of important decisions that are rooted in the census, including the drawing of electoral districts and the allocation of government resources.\n        Various steps must be taken now to ensure an accurate count, starting with an investigation by the committees that oversee the bureau -- Oversight and Government Reform in the House, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in the Senate -- into why the men quit. This will clear up a distracting mystery and is necessary to ensure that the new directors do not confront the same obstacles.\n        Equally important, the appropriations committees in the House and Senate must quickly act to restore the roughly $50 million cut by the previous Congress from President Bush's 2007 budget request for the bureau. Otherwise, the agency may have to forgo using hand-held computers for the next census, relying instead on paper and pencil, which is less accurate and would probably be more expensive in the long run because of its inefficiency.\n        An alternative and equally unacceptable way to cut costs would be to delay the economic census, which is currently conducted every five years and which serves as the benchmark for dozens of other government surveys, including reports on inflation, construction activity and retail sales.\n        Carlos Gutierrez, the secretary of commerce, should be pounding the tables in Congress to get this money; failure to do so would suggest that the administration is trying to undermine the census. For his part, Mr. Bush must swiftly nominate a new director -- a nonpartisan, professional statistician with solid management experience.\n        Mr. Kincannon has graciously agreed to remain until his replacement is confirmed, but moving forward requires a new director. For the deputy director position, administration officials must resist any temptation to make a political appointment and should choose instead a top-notch statistician from the bureau's career ranks.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1774692,"ids":"1774692,1774725,1774836","split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Last month the Supreme Court offered self-indulgent state legislatures the judicial equivalent of a hot fudge sundae when it mostly approved the wildly partisan Texas redistricting plan engineered by former Representative Tom DeLay. It was a depressing outcome and one that made it even more critical that local elected officials be mobilized to adopt more equitable methods of drawing political boundaries.\n        That is very much the case in New York, which suffers from a different form of compulsive gerrymandering than Texas. Instead of manipulating geography to give one party the political edge, the New York State Legislature -- divided for so long between a Republican Senate and Democratic Assembly -- tends to stick to protecting incumbents.\n        In some ways, this is even worse for democracy. When maps are drawn to cut down on competition, politicians worry less about pesky voters, who generally wind up choosing between the incumbent and a sacrificial lamb dragooned by an opposition that has no hope of victory. Politics and politicians stagnate: Albany is an excellent case in point.\n        A few brave souls, like Assemblyman Michael Gianaris, a Democrat from Queens, are offering a vast improvement in the state's future mapmaking. The Gianaris bill would require the state to set up an independent commission, much like the one in Iowa, which currently has the fairest system -- and some of the most competitive elections -- in the country. The commission would redraw the maps and the legislature would approve or reject then, with no tinkering allowed.\n        If anything is going to happen to make the situation better, this is the time to move -- while the 2010 census is still just a blip on the horizon. When election-bound politicians come around seeking votes, New Yorkers should make sure to ask them whether they support fair mapmaking as reflected in the Gianaris bill or the Iowa redistricting system.\n        Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the Democrat who is now leading in the polls in the gubernatorial race, has promised to veto any redistricting package that is not done the right way. At this stage, though, legislators hold the key to reform. If your local Assembly and Senate candidates want your vote this year, they should promise to do the opposite of what Tom DeLay did. That, in turn, means creating a redistricting commission that carves up the state's political maps by the numbers, not according to instructions from party headquarters.\n        Fair mapmaking won't be easy for Albany's timid lawmakers, who tend to see change as threatening. But if anything can bring some much-needed oxygen into New York's Legislature, it is something that many of them fear: real competition.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1747944,"ids":1747944,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Last spring, a battle over sewage wore on between two communities in Westchester, each with a credible claim to the moral and environmental high ground and with a comparable reservoir of virtuous stubbornness. This page held its nose and waded in between them.\n        It supported the diversion of sewage from an ailing, overtaxed treatment plant in Yorktown to a bigger, better one in Peekskill on the grounds that solving an immediate problem - keeping contaminated stormwater from fouling the source of drinking water for nine million people - was more urgent than resolving slightly more abstract, though no less significant, concerns about development, sprawl and environmental racism.\n        Better to send treated effluent into the Hudson than the raw stuff into the reservoir, our thinking went -- even if that made Peekskill hot under its blue collar and might have allowed more McMansions to sprout in leafy Yorktown.\n        Such an arrangement was fine with Yorktown, though not with Peekskill, which argued that it would not only burden working-class Peekskill with what one critic called ''the effluents of the affluent,'' but would unfairly limit Peekskill's own economic ambitions while lifting what had been a tight lid on sprawl in Yorktown.\n        But that whole argument is now dead. New circumstances make it moot.\n        The first is that the Peekskill plant cannot, after all, readily relieve Yorktown's sewage burden. A study last year by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection found that the plant would need to be expanded and given lots of new pipes and pumping-station improvements to handle the Yorktown flow, a big technical and political hurdle in a county government where diversion was becoming an ever dirtier word.\n        The second is that the Department of Environmental Protection, the agency charged with protecting the region's water supply, became willing to make exceptions to rules it had refused for years to bend. After vigorously dismissing every call to upgrade and expand the Hallocks Mills plant in Yorktown as impossible and irresponsible, the agency has backed down. Yorktown officials have, too, and are seeking to come up with as much as $40 million to upgrade and expand Hallocks Mills.\n        So far so good. It's easy to stand corrected on this, because it's easy to share Peekskill's relief at avoiding being unfairly dumped upon by Yorktown. It's also good that Hallocks Mills will someday handle stormwater surges better, and that people's water will be cleaner as a result.\n        But we reserve the right to wield our previous arguments against the ever-present danger of irresponsible growth. The upgrading of Yorktown's sewage plant must not become the catalyst for sprawl. Sewer hookups are to developers what crowded subway cars are to pickpockets: an invitation to be very, very bad.\n        The pressure to develop the area must be kept in check, or the waste flow will grow, and everyone will be back where they started.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1805118,"ids":1805118,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Last week's elections provided a lot of disturbing news about the reliability of electronic voting -- starting, naturally, with Florida. In a Congressional race there between Vern Buchanan, a Republican, and Christine Jennings, a Democrat, the machines in Sarasota County reported that more than 18,000 people, or one in eight, did not choose either candidate. That ''undervote'' of nearly 13 percent is hard to believe, given that only about 2.5 percent of absentee voters did not vote in that race. If there was a glitch, it may have made all the difference. Ms. Jennings trails Mr. Buchanan by about 400 votes.\n        The serious questions about the Buchanan-Jennings race only add to the high level of mistrust that many people already feel about electronic voting. More than half of the states, including California, New York, Ohio and Illinois, now require that electronic voting machines produce voter-verified paper records, which help ensure that votes are properly recorded. But Congress has resisted all appeals to pass a law that would ensure that electronic voting is honest and accurate across the nation.\n        Fortunately, that may be about to change. With the Democrats now in control of both houses, there is an excellent chance of passing tough electronic voting legislation. Representative Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, had more than 200 co-sponsors for a strong electronic voting bill before this month's election, and support is likely to grow in the new Congress. In the Senate, Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who will be chairwoman of the Rules and Administration Committee, which oversees elections, plans to develop a similar bill.\n        The problems with elections go well beyond electronic voting. Partisan secretaries of state continue to skew the rules to favor their parties and political allies. States are adopting harsh standards for voter registration drives to make it harder for people to register, as well as draconian voter identification laws to make casting a ballot harder for poor people, racial minorities, the elderly and students. Some states have adopted an indefensible rule that provisional ballots cast at the wrong table of the correct polling place must be thrown out.\n        Congress has failed to address these and other important flaws with the mechanics of the election system. But this, too, may be about to change. Senator Feinstein is saying that providing fair access to the ballot will be among her committee's top priorities in the coming year. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, plans to revise and reintroduce her ''Count Every Vote Act,'' which takes an admirably broad approach to overhauling the voting system.\n        Election reform has tended to be a partisan issue, with Democrats arguing for reform and Republicans resisting it. It shouldn't be. Congressional Democrats should make fixing this country's broken system of elections a top priority, and Republicans should join them.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1658140,"ids":1658140,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Last week, as Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain unveiled the commission on Africa's report to tackle poverty, Bob Geldof, the Band Aid star-turned-humanitarian, walked to the microphone with expletive-filled advice for how Mr. Blair and the British chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, should get the American president, George Bush, to step up to the plate on aid to Africa. Saving Africa, Mr. Geldof said, would cost ''half a stick of chewing gum a day'' for each citizen of the Group of 8 industrialized nations.\n        ''Tony and Gordon have to prepare to ring up George and say, 'Do this, George, do this one thing for me, it's going to cost you [nothing], do it for me,'' Mr. Geldof said. Any thoughts that Mr. Blair would disapprove of Mr. Geldof's rant were dispelled when the prime minister walked on stage and backed the aging rocker. ''Because I'm a politician in a suit, I wince at the occasional word, but, actually, what he said is really what I think.''\n        As everyone knows, Mr. Blair has made Britain an unwavering member of President Bush's coalition of the willing in Iraq, at his own political peril. The favor he asked in return was a noble one -- for America to join other wealthy countries in substantially raising aid to Africa to cut poverty there. He and the architects of the United Nations' Millennium Development Project, to which America has signed on, say the number of people living in poverty around the world -- 1.1 billion -- can be cut in half by 2015 if rich countries donate 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to development.\n        Mr. Blair's report calls for African leaders to take responsibility for the part they have played in grinding the continent into the dust. It demands that they move faster toward democracy and stamp out corruption. But it also points out that wretched dictators and autocrats have been propped up by bribes, paid willingly by international corporations.\n        The aid and attention that have gone to Africa from Europe, Japan and America pale in comparison with what rich countries have been willing to squander on far less noble causes than providing drinking water for a 3-year-old in Chad. The report asks for an additional $25 billion a year in aid by 2010. With the right tools, Mr. Blair says, Africa has the same economic potential as Asia.\n        Mr. Blair will most likely be able to get most of his European colleagues on board this year. Less certain are Japan and -- most iffy of all -- America. So what will Mr. Bush do? Well, he will certainly point to his Millennium Challenge Account, which ties development aid to good governance. Indeed, the Millennium Challenge Account on Monday approved its first project -- $110 million to help finance, among other things, microcredit agencies, agricultural building centers and land title programs in Madagascar.\n        The Madagascar project and, indeed, the Millennium Challenge Account are both very worthy projects, and we applaud the Bush administration for the initiative. But they are not enough. They are not even close to what America can afford. It is long past time for Mr. Bush to stand shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Blair on Africa, just as Mr. Blair stood with Mr. Bush on Iraq.\n        Bob Geldof's language was over the top, but his point was right.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1647260,"ids":1647260,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Last week, the Bureau of Land Management signed a decision to allow new oil and gas leasing on some of the most important and most fragile grasslands left in America. At risk is an expanse of wild Chihuahuan Desert grasslands -- the largest still in existence -- in the Otero Mesa area along New Mexico's south-central border.\n        The delicacy of the region is not immediately apparent to the eye. But under the desert grasses -- which sustain a genetically important population of pronghorns -- there is a layer of soil just thin enough to keep invasive shrubs at bay. Below that layer lies an underground reservoir of water, which also needs protection. The Bush administration is determined to force its way onto the Otero Mesa. Gov. Bill Richardson, backed by a coalition of ranchers and environmentalists, is determined to stop it.\n        The bureau's plan sounds extremely modest on paper: 141 wells disturbing only some 1,600 acres. Compared with the scope of other gas-and oil-producing regions of New Mexico, the amount of land affected would be almost nothing. But conservationists say the B.L.M.'s plan -- restrictive as it sounds -- places no real impediment in the way of future development of a much larger area. Otero Mesa's grasslands cover more than a million acres; the Wilderness Society estimates that under the bureau's land use plan for the area, 95 percent of these acres remain open to oil and gas leasing.\n        This is part of a familiar scene in the West. The Bush administration has set its sights on dozens of ecologically valuable areas that could easily be declared off limits without imperiling the country's supplies of oil and natural gas. As it is, 85 percent of the petroleum resources on public lands in the Western states are already leased or available for leasing. Any oil or gas found in the Otero grasslands is likely to make only a minuscule addition to America's domestic energy supply, but could desecrate irreplaceable natural wealth.\n        The difference this time is that the state of New Mexico will oppose the Bush administration, so the fate of these grasslands is likely to be tied up in court for a good long time to come. But it deserves more permanent protection than that. Mr. Richardson has offered a compromise that would set aside 640,000 acres of the grasslands as a conservation area, providing space for ranchers, wildlife and the ecosystem. That is a reasonable offer, which the administration would be foolish to refuse.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1846108,"ids":1846108,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Last year, Congressional Democrats allowed the Bush administration to ram through one of the worst laws in the nation's history -- the Military Commissions Act of 2006. This year, the Democrats pledged to use their new majority to begin repairing the profound damage the law has done to the nation's justice system and global image.\n        But there are disturbing signs their pledge may fall victim to the same tactical political calculations and Bush administration propagandizing that allowed this scandalous law to pass in the first place.\n        Rewriting the act should start with one simple step: restoring to prisoners of the war on terror the fundamental right to challenge their detention in a real court. So far, promised measures to restore habeas corpus have yet to see the light of day, and they may remain buried unless Democratic leaders make them a priority and members of both parties vote on principle, not out of fear of attack ads.\n        President Bush turned habeas corpus into a partisan issue by declaring that the prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, even innocent ones, do not deserve a hearing. Lawmakers who objected were painted as friends of terrorists.\n        But let's be clear. There is nothing ''conservative'' or ''tough on terrorism'' in selectively stripping people of their rights. Suspending habeas corpus is an extreme notion on the radical fringes of democratic philosophy. As four retired military chief prosecutors -- from the Navy, the Marines and the Army -- pointed out to Congress, holding prisoners without access to courts merely feeds Al Qaeda's propaganda machine, increases the risk to the American military and sets a precedent by which other governments could justify detaining American civilians without charges or appeal.\n        Consider some of the other wild-eyed liberals calling on Congress to restore habeas corpus: William Sessions, director of the F.B.I. under the first President Bush; David Keene, head of the American Conservative Union; the National Association of Evangelicals; David Neff, editor of Christianity Today, founded by the Rev. Billy Graham; a long list of other evangelical leaders and scholars; and nearly two dozen sitting and retired federal judges.\n        There are a half-dozen bills in the House and the Senate that would restore habeas corpus. But the Democratic leadership has not found a way to bring the issue to a vote. The first vehicle is the Defense Department's budget authorization bill. But Representative Ike Skelton, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, chose not to include habeas corpus in his baseline version of the measure, known as the chairman's mark, which will be taken up by the committee today.\n        We hope habeas will be added to the bill by the committee, or that other sponsors of measures to restore the ancient right, including Representatives John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Jerrold Nadler of New York, and Senators Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, will find ways to bring their bills to a vote.\n        The Democratic majority has a long list of wrongs to right from six years of Mr. Bush's leadership. We are sympathetic to their concerns about finding a way to revive habeas corpus that won't die in committee or be subject to a presidential veto of a larger bill. But lawmakers sometimes have to stand on principle and trust the voters to understand.\n        This is one of those times.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1785665,"ids":1785665,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Last year, many state Republicans and some commentators predicted that millionaires would soon stampede from Connecticut, fleeing south. The issue was not the cold winters or high property taxes. The issue was the decision to make Connecticut's estate tax permanent.\n        Some saw the move as a blatant attempt to soak the rich. Others made dire predictions that the very economy of the state would be shaken as, presumably, the well-heeled searched for a more financially advantageous place in which to die.\n        It all seemed a little tinged with hysteria. And so far these fears appear to have little basis in fact. Since the inheritance tax was first increased in 2003 (in a move that was supposed to be temporary), the number of millionaires has increased 44 percent. Those making $2 million or more are up 57 percent.\n        Higher taxes for those in upper-income brackets have long been an ideological fault line in Connecticut, with Democrats traditionally arguing in favor of inheritance taxes and higher income taxes for the rich, and Republicans fighting both concepts, partly on the grounds that they will drive away the better-off and ultimately hurt more than help.\n        The basic income tax rates have not changed since they were first instituted in the early 1990's; a married person in Connecticut making more than $20,000, for example, is taxed at a maximum marginal rate of 5 percent, no matter how high that person's salary or how great his or her assets.\n        The inheritance, or estate, tax is another story. Connecticut's estate tax for years was linked to the federal inheritance tax. But as the federal tax dwindled, so did the state's tax collections. In response, state legislators in 2003 fashioned a tax that could function apart from the federal tax and promised it would be a temporary fix for a budget shortfall. The tax applied to estates worth more than $1 million.\n        But the ''temporary'' tax brought in more money than predicted. During another budget shortfall last year, Gov. M. Jodi Rell signed a law that made the tax permanent, while raising the size of estates to which it would apply to $2 million or more.\n        The move infuriated people who believed that the tax was unfair and would hurt the economy. Others assumed that the well-off would move to places like Florida, which does not tax estates.\n        Even Governor Rell seemed to have regrets. She asked the legislature to repeal the law this year. The Democratic-controlled General Assembly refused. One reason is that the tax brings in about $150 million, though that does not loom large in a $15 billion budget. The other and perhaps more important reason is that the issue has come to symbolize the differences between the two parties.\n        The numbers reveal little negative impact so far, although the debate will surely continue, and may escalate during this campaign season. There is no reason that voters should not hear arguments for and against the tax. But these arguments should be based on the merits, not on fears of an exodus that has not happened.","adu_anecdote":16,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1676633,"ids":1676633,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Lawmakers have long known that the rich have ample opportunity to avoid paying income taxes. So, since 1969, the federal code has included provisions to crimp the excessive use of tax shelters and ensure that the wealthy pay taxes. This year, for instance, an estimated 7,600 millionaires would owe no income tax at all if it were not for the anti-sheltering provisions, known collectively as the alternative minimum tax.\n        But the alternative tax has gone haywire and is unfairly hitting a growing number of middle-income filers with fat tax bills, while failing to snare multimillionaires. By 2010, a couple in New York who earn $100,000 a year and claim tax deductions for a few children and state taxes will be more likely to owe the alternative tax than an unmarried billionaire in Montana making a much more generous living off a tax-sheltered stock portfolio.\n        The reasons for the malfunction are complex, involving the interplay of various taxes with one another and with the economy. But this is hardly the only complicated part of the tax code, and rather than deal with the complexity and repair the alternative tax, a group of influential senators recently introduced a bill to repeal it altogether. Among them are Charles Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Max Baucus, the committee's senior Democrat.\n        Outright repeal is not a serious response to a serious problem. Under the guise of protecting middle-class taxpayers, it would amount to another unnecessary and unaffordable tax cut for the very wealthy. It would also cripple the Treasury, costing the government at least $611 billion over the next 10 years. At a time when the government is already trillions of dollars in debt, that's preposterous. What is needed is a way to curb aggressive tax sheltering while preserving legitimate tax breaks for middle-income taxpayers -- without exploding the deficit.\n        For starters, Congress should protect middle-income filers by adjusting the alternative tax for inflation. Currently there is no such adjustment, so over time, ever more taxpayers reach income levels at which the alternative tax kicks in. Congress should also enact a provision that would exempt anyone making $100,000 or less from the alternative tax. Presto! The alternative tax would no longer be a scourge on the middle class.\n        Then, to fight excessive tax sheltering, Congress should close a gaping loophole in the law that allows wealthy investors to avoid paying the alternative tax on much of their investment income. Here's how the loophole works: The tax rate on investment income is typically much lower than the rate on wages and salary. For example, the tax on a $1,000 capital gain from the sale of stock generally comes to $150, while the tax on $1,000 of salary can be as high as $350. The special low rate on investment income allows investors to avoid paying tens of billions of dollars in taxes each year. And yet the alternative tax does not treat that super-low rate as a tax shelter.\n        To be fair and efficient -- and to help make up the revenue that would be lost by shielding middle-income taxpayers from the alternative tax -- investment income should be taxed the same as ordinary earned income under the alternative system. That would be anathema to anti-tax crusaders for whom the mere mention of taxing capital gains is blasphemy. But there are no easy fixes to thorny tax problems. Congress must face up to its difficult choices, the sooner the better.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1837157,"ids":1837157,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Lawmakers in Albany have a bad habit of waiting until the chaotic closing days of the legislative session to focus on important legislation.

Ultimately, though, it will take Mr. Spitzer's firm leadership to sustain the momentum.\n        Fortunately, Mr. Spitzer is no stranger to the issue, having seen the need for a strong state anti-trafficking law during his years as attorney general. Fortunately, too, this year's quest for comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation need not start from scratch. Mr. Dinowitz's current bill provides a good working draft, and the city's bar association has suggested a number of useful refinements.\n        This is a matter lawmakers of both parties in both chambers of the Legislature should be able to agree upon, given a timely nudge from the governor.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1777981,"ids":1777981,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Leading medical journals seem to be having a difficult time disentangling themselves from the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. If they cannot stop printing articles by scientists with close ties to these businesses, they should at least force the authors to disclose their conflicts of interest publicly so that doctors and patients are forewarned that the interpretations may be biased.\n        Two disturbing cases were described in detail by The Wall Street Journal in recent weeks. One involved The Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA; the other an obscure journal known as Neuropsychopharmacology, which is published by a leading professional society in the field.\n        The article in JAMA must surely have pleased all makers of antidepressant drugs. It warned pregnant women that if they stopped taking antidepressant medication they would increase their risk of falling back into depression. Hidden from view was the fact that most of the 13 authors had been paid as consultants or lecturers by the makers of antidepressants. Their financial ties were not disclosed to JAMA on the preposterous grounds that the authors did not deem them relevant.\n        An even more egregious set of events occurred at Neuropsychopharmacology, which recently published a favorable assessment of a controversial new treatment for depression resistant to conventional therapies. Left unmentioned was that eight of the nine authors serve as consultants to the company that makes the device used in the therapy. The ninth works directly for the company. Just to make things particularly incestuous, the lead author of the study is the journal's editor and a consultant to the company. He has been accused in the past of promoting therapies in which he had a financial stake.\n        It is hard to know whether to be more upset at the journal's failure to disclose these ties or at its decision to let such interested parties serve as authors in the first place. Early drafts of the article were prepared by a professional writer hired by the company. With all those ingredients coalescing, it is no wonder that the new therapy was judged ''a promising and well-tolerated intervention'' for treatment-resistant depression.\n        Many journals have been tightening their disclosure and publication policies in recent years, and both JAMA and Neuropsychopharmacology plan further tightening. But the reforms are not likely to go far enough. It seems imperative that more muscle be put into forcing disclosure and publication of conflicts of interest. If all leading journals agreed to punish authors who fail to reveal their conflicts by refusing to accept further manuscripts from them, a lot more authors would be inclined to fess up. Better yet, journals should try much harder to find authors free of conflicts. That is the best hope for retaining credibility with doctors and the public.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1838691,"ids":1838691,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Less than two weeks ago, Gov. M. Jodi Rell became the first Connecticut governor in decades to propose a state law to cap property tax increases.\n        Almost immediately, in what is beginning to be a pattern here, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate dismissed the move. The House speaker, James Amann, called it ''mumbo jumbo.'' The Senate president pro tempore, Donald Williams, called it ''a gimmick.''\n        It is neither of these things. Connecticut residents, who suffer under the second-highest property taxes in the country, deserve more consideration on this issue than they have received from the majority Democrats.\n        The governor's idea got predictable criticism for not being proposed sooner. But she offered this latest plan in reaction to opponents who said that her February proposal to spend millions more on education was not balanced by curbs on the rise in property taxes.\n        People were afraid, and rightly so, that towns would take additional state money while continuing to raise property taxes. For residents of a state whose property taxes are second only to New Jersey's, this was unacceptable. Because the tax cap would be coupled with big increases in state aid for education, limiting the rise of local taxes should not adversely affect school districts.\n        Every cap has exceptions, and Ms. Rell's has four. A town budget could increase more than 3 percent if there's an emergency; if the tax roll grew more than 1.5 percent; if the state did not keep its promise to finance education at specified levels and if the town's governing body and residents voted to override the cap. This last option is not unheard of; many Massachusetts towns have voted to override their state-mandated cap of 2.5 percent.\n        The cap could potentially limit arbitration awards. When negotiations between unions and towns deadlock, state arbitrators decide on the level of raises for teachers, police officers and firefighters. This proposal would force arbitrators to take into account the ability of a municipality to stay within the 3 percent cap before deciding the awards. But given the additional state money for education, this clause should not hurt the school budgets.\n        Finally, there are those who protest that such a cap would handcuff town officials and throw the budget process into chaos. But voters already roil the budget process. Many Connecticut municipalities pass their budgets at town meetings, and it is not unusual to see the ornery electorate vote against budgets several times.\n        More than half the states impose limits on the rise of property taxes. New Jersey just voted for one, and Massachusetts has had one for 27 years. There is no reason that Connecticut should not be among them.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1796191,"ids":1796191,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Let us all agree: North Korea's government is too erratic, too brutal, and too willing to sell what it has built to have a nuclear bomb. There is also no military solution, not least because intelligence experts haven't a clue where Pyongyang has hidden its weapons labs or its stock of plutonium.\n        So after years of temporizing and denial, the world's leaders need to figure out how to force this terrible genie back into the bottle. It is a truism that no country that has tested a nuclear weapon has ever been pressured or cajoled into giving it up. But neither has any nuclear postulant been as vulnerable to outside pressure and bribery as this regime.\n        The Bush administration seems to want to impose limited sanctions on North Korea -- and inspections of all cargo going into and out of the country -- until it agrees to abandon its entire weapons program. We fear that won't be enough to quickly change Pyongyang's mind -- while key players like China won't sign on to never-ending punishments.\n        We believe this must instead be a two-step process, starting with a Security Council-ordered ban on all trade, until the North agrees to stop expanding its arsenal. Pyongyang must be told that there will be no further attempt at negotiation until it halts all plutonium production, forswears additional tests and readmits United Nations inspectors.\n        In practice, the North Koreans are likely to back down only if China chokes off their oil supply and other essential trade. Until now Beijing has refused to use its enormous leverage, fearing that too much pressure could topple the North Korean government and unleash a mass of refugees over its border. When told they were enabling their neighbor's nuclear ambitions, Chinese diplomats blithely insisted that the North was likely bluffing about having a weapon. Now, Washington, Tokyo, Moscow and others have to make clear that China will be judged by its willingness to confront this problem.\n        The Security Council must also make clear that it is still demanding the complete dismantlement of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. For that, negotiations are the only hope. It is impossible to know whether North Korea will give up its weapons at any price. But it has never been tested -- mainly because the Bush administration has not made the sort of serious offer, including security guarantees, that might make a bargain worthwhile.\n        The administration has indulged in its own denial and temporizing. Last year, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice dismissed the North's declaration that it had nuclear weapons as a bid for attention. ''I do think the North Koreans have been, frankly, a little bit disappointed that people are not jumping up and down and running around with their hair on fire,'' she told The Wall Street Journal.\n        Since then, United States policy has whipsawed between negotiations and posturing, incentives and sanctions. It has been months since negotiators even sat down at the table. Administration hawks suggested last week that perhaps the best thing would be for the North to test, so the world would know exactly what it was dealing with. The hawks appear to have gotten their way.

Even he would not deny that any more. His many friends gave lots of money to his political campaign, presumably to buy advertising to convince other people that Mr. McGowan was what he said he was: an honest public servant who deserved re-election.\n        He wasn't and he didn't. But the money piled up anyway.\n        Mr. McGowan put that money to other uses: trips to Ireland and Florida, credit card bills, steak dinners and visits to a spa. He took bribes from a campaign vendor and tampered with campaign records and a witness in the investigation.\n        Mr. McGowan lived as if it were Mardi Gras all the time, said Thomas Spota, the Suffolk district attorney, whose office has bagged political cheats, dirty-dealers and thieves, one after another, with the cool efficiency and energy of a pest-removal company.\n        As with termites and wood-borer beetles, selfish politicians are part of the Long Island landscape. Removing them usually gives only temporary relief, because others emerge to take their place. They cannot be wished away; they have to be chased, hounded, trapped and punished. Long Island is lucky to have the relentless Mr. Spota and his anti-corruption squad on the job. It is impossible to tell where and whom he will strike next, but it is comforting to know that the county's as-yet-unindicted public servants are surely watching their backs.\n        Which brings us to the Peter J. McGowan Concourse at MacArthur Airport. While it's not possible to peer into Mr. McGowan's heart to see exactly why he went to the dark side, the ingredients of his corruption are easy to spot. The airport terminal was a dead giveaway. Mr. McGowan played a key role in luring Southwest Airlines to Long Island in the 1990's, spurring MacArthur's growth and giving the town's economy and stature a major boost.\n        Politicians hate not getting credit for things, and the ambitious, ruthless and self-absorbed Mr. McGowan must have hated the thought of having to retire before having something so sleek and magnificent as an airport concourse named for him. Passengers flying into Islip to do business and people watching him promote his town in TV spots would always know whom to credit: Proud Pete.\n        We all know what pride goeth before. The question is whether Mr. McGowan should have to tumble into obscurity as a result of his corruption. While many would just as soon be rid of a townwide embarrassment, maybe it isn't crazy to suggest that his name should stay where it is, perhaps with a sign explaining the charges he pleaded guilty to and the days remaining in his sentence.\n        Such a display would evoke winces, smirks and rueful shakes of the head. But it would be a useful reminder of what our public servants can turn into, if we let them.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1721070,"ids":1721070,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Let us pause and count the ways the conduct of the war in Iraq has damaged America's image and needlessly endangered the lives of those in the military. First, multilateralism was tossed aside. Then the post-invasion fiasco muddied the reputation of military planners and caused unnecessary casualties. The W.M.D. myth undermined the credibility of United States intelligence and President Bush himself, and the abuse of prisoners stole America's moral high ground.\n        Now the use of a ghastly weapon called white phosphorus has raised questions about how careful the military has been in avoiding civilian casualties. It has also further tarnished America's credibility on international treaties and the rules of warfare.\n        White phosphorus, which dates to World War II, should have been banned generations ago. Packed into an artillery shell, it explodes over a battlefield in a white glare that can illuminate an enemy's positions. It also rains balls of flaming chemicals, which cling to anything they touch and burn until their oxygen supply is cut off. They can burn for hours inside a human body.\n        The United States restricted the use of incendiaries like white phosphorus after Vietnam, and in 1983, an international convention banned its use against civilians. In fact, one of the many crimes ascribed to Saddam Hussein was dropping white phosphorus on Kurdish rebels and civilians in 1991.\n        But white phosphorus has made an ugly comeback. Italian television reported that American forces used it in Falluja last year against insurgents. At first, the Pentagon said the chemical had been used only to illuminate the battlefield, but had to backpedal when it turned out that one of the Army's own publications talked about using white phosphorus against insurgent positions, a practice well known enough to have one of those unsettling military nicknames: ''shake and bake.''\n        The Pentagon says white phosphorus was never aimed at civilians, but there are lingering reports of civilian victims. The military can't say whether the reports are true and does not intend to investigate them, a decision we find difficult to comprehend. Pentagon spokesmen say the Army took ''extraordinary measures'' to reduce civilian casualties, but they cannot say what those measures were.\n        They also say that using white phosphorus against military targets is legal. That's true, but the 1983 convention bans its use against ''civilians or civilian objects,'' which would make white phosphorus attacks in urban settings like Falluja highly inappropriate at best. The United States signed that convention, but the portion dealing with incendiary weapons has been awaiting ratification in the Senate.\n        These are technicalities, in any case. Iraq, where winning over wary civilians is as critical as defeating armed insurgents, is no place to be using a weapon like this. More broadly, American demands for counterproliferation efforts and international arms control ring a bit hollow when the United States refuses to give up white phosphorus, not to mention cluster bombs and land mines.\n        The United States should be leading the world, not dragging its feet, when it comes to this sort of issue -- because it's right and because all of us, including Americans, are safer in a world in which certain forms of conduct are regarded as too inhumane even for war. That is why torture should be banned in American prisons. And it is why the United States should stop using white phosphorus.","adu_anecdote":14,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1767932,"ids":1767932,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Let's hope no rock is left unturned by federal investigators looking into the shady Congressional art of winning friends and dishing ''earmarks'' -- the lucrative favors that lawmakers secretly cram into spending bills at the behest of deep-pocketed contractors. Former Representative Randy Cunningham massaged earmark abuses into a prison term for bribery. And now investigators are focusing on the office of one of Congress's budgetary potentates -- Representative Jerry Lewis, the California Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, which writes the major spending bills.\n        Mr. Lewis denies any wrongdoing, as does his former staff aide and earmarks maestro, Letitia White. Ms. White honed the process well enough to become a high-powered lobbyist dubbed ''queen of earmarks'' for her continuing knack for attaching special-interest contracts to spending bills written in her former boss's committee.\n        As a Capitol Hill staffer, Ms. White helped direct hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks to clients of the lobbying firm that she eventually joined, and where she has lately been making more than $3 million a year. Investigators suspect there's been a tidy taxpayer money churn in which Mr. Lewis may have traded earmarks for political campaign donations from defense contractors and lobbyists enjoying the inside track. Illegal or not, the facts of money-greased politics slowly emerging deserve full attention from voters who fantasize that lawmakers are battling nobly for lobby-bereft little people.\n        In her first year in the private sector, Ms. White bought a Capitol Hill house for $1 million cash, according to the Times reporter David Kirkpatrick, and half of the cost turned out to be paid by a defense contractor who reaps millions in earmarks via the lobbying firm. The house, in turn, became the locus for a fund-raising organization founded by the defense contractor, who -- like Ms. White's lobbying firm -- is a leading donor to Mr. Lewis's campaign kitty.\n        If this circle of insider back-scratching is not dizzying enough, it should be noted that Congressman Lewis's stepdaughter was hired to direct the fund-raising shop at the million-dollar house.\n        Thus goes business as usual on the Hill, where lawmakers refuse to properly police themselves but have the gall to rail at criminal prosecutors showing up on behalf of the public. The earmark cornucopia shows how the fear of President Dwight Eisenhower 45 years ago about the rise of the military-industrial complex was dead-on prophecy: ''The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.''","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1647821,"ids":1647821,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Lewis Carroll would have liked Albany a lot. Sometimes, the New York Legislature feels like one big, mad Alice in Wonderland tea party where language becomes loopy and turns inside out like a kind of accidental M\u00f6bius strip. For example, the concept of legislative reform has for some people come to mean almost anything, including the status quo.\n        Take the recent comments of Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, when the Senate voted for its new rules last month. Some of these rules are less enlightened than the old ones. Yet Mr. Bruno declared them part of a ''broad package of reform.''\n        To Democratic senators who tried to explain that these ''reforms'' would steer the Legislature deeper into dysfunction, Mr. Bruno offered an argument so circular it could have come from the Cheshire cat. He said that ''reform is in the eye of the beholder,'' that as far as he was concerned the rules adopted that day constituted reform, and that if you don't like that, then ''we are where we are.''\n        The Assembly, by contrast, has made a small dent in the old way of doing things. It has ended the practice of empty-seat voting, requiring the presence of members while legislation is being passed. This has caused some grumbling but has also inspired real debate.\n        Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, a Democrat from Buffalo, recently gave an impassioned speech against a sales tax in Erie County that does not bring any money to his urban district. To the dismay of Assembly leaders, who are not accustomed to any bill being voted down, the Assembly decided Mr. Hoyt had a point; they rejected an extension of the tax. Assembly whips suddenly had to do their jobs, scurrying about and coaxing members to vote for the tax, which passed the second time around. In most legislatures, this would hardly bear noting. In Albany, it was almost revolutionary.\n        Mr. Bruno claims that senators too have ended ghost voting. Let's hope it really works that way. It is also possible that the new rules have simply added to Mr. Bruno's considerable power over his fellow senators. Senators now have to vote in person unless they get a pass from the Senate -- that is, from Mr. Bruno.\n        Right now, some of the Senate's votes aren't even recorded. And there is no easy way to obtain a transcript of the debate. One small hope for the public is that Mr. Bruno would like sessions to be televised in the future.\n        Perhaps the Senate's worst change will allow the majority party to confine future rules reforms to the Rules Committee, which is controlled by Mr. Bruno and his crowd. Senator John Sabini, a Democrat from Queens, was so incensed by it all that after a long night's debate he said, ''I'll bet you that the Iraq National Assembly will have better rules than we have.'' So far, his bet has had no takers.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1712752,"ids":1712752,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Like any structures begun over a century ago, the pieces of New York's aging transportation system desperately need updating. Most commuters know this already. When a fire destroyed one 70-year-old signal room in New York City's antique subway, it nearly rerouted thousands of riders for years. People taking trains or buses to work have dealt with regular, sudden breakdowns and disruptions, often explained on intercoms that cannot be understood in any language. Bridges and overpasses across the state also need work, and some highways are so patched and ragged that the only people enjoying the ride are those selling shock absorbers.\n        Any voter who has complained about bumpy commuting in recent years now has a decent option: to vote for Proposition2 on the Nov. 8 ballot. That proposal, the Renew and Rebuild New York transportation bond issue, would pay for $2.9 billion in structural improvements over the next five years in a fiscally responsible way.\n        The bond issue would allow the state to borrow half of that money for bridges and highways upstate, and the other half for the whole complex transportation structure downstate. For New York City, it would mean $60 million for new subway cars and $90 million for new buses. Money would also be available to enhance tunnel lighting, to replace tracks and to set up a better system for tracking and regulating buses. The money would finally launch the first new subway routes since World War II: the Second Avenue subway and East Side access from Long Island to Grand Central.\n        Critics of this bond issue note that a recent surplus will allow the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to give riders a lower rate for the holidays, and they point to New York State's mounting debt. But the surplus appears to be a one-time bonus that should help with one-time costs, not the renovation of an old system. As for state debt, most of it is the wrong kind, debt contracted on the sly by the quasi-public authorities that don't have to play by the state rules. This bond issue is straightforward: a request to the voters, as the law requires. Such ''front door'' debt comes at a better rate, which ultimately costs the state and its taxpayers less money.\n        If the bond issue fails, look for worse news for anybody who uses the roads or the rails in this state. Somebody will have to pay to keep things running, and more bad debt is one solution. Or commuters can face even higher fare increases even sooner than the ones planned for 2007.

These programs sorely need better coordination and predictability -- and a clear way to measure whether they are working. Randall Tobias, the new director of foreign assistance, is a good manager and could impose much-needed coherence.\n        But there are worrisome signs that the administration is also planning deep cuts in antipoverty spending as aid is supposedly reoriented to promote democracy and fight terrorism. A little-noticed statement on the Web site of the Agency for International Development says the goal is to ''focus all U.S. foreign assistance on helping to build and sustain democratic and well-governed states.''\n        Of the nearly $24 billion requested by the State Department for foreign aid this year, a little over $1 billion is devoted to democracy programs, including training legislative staffs, helping reform courts, and working with women's and business organizations. Privately, officials say that number is likely to rise substantially in next year's budget request, while the roughly $3.7 billion devoted to antipoverty programs -- fighting disease, promoting education, providing microcredit loans -- is likely to fall to make up the difference.\n        While foreign aid spending is up over all in the Bush administration, the increase has come almost entirely in four programs: aid to Iraq and Afghanistan, the 15-country global AIDS initiative and the new Millennium Challenge Corporation, which seeks to help well-governed poor countries.\n        In a worrisome sign, money for programs to address childhood disease and maternal mortality is down by one-third in this year's budget request. The administration is also cutting antipoverty spending in Latin America and Africa to pay for programs in Islamic countries, considered to be front-line states in the war against terror.\n        Promoting democracy and fighting terrorism are laudable goals. But such work needs to come on top of -- not instead of -- financing antipoverty programs, which save hundreds of thousands of lives and earn untold good will for the United States. There is also little indication that America knows how to build democracy. There are too many worrisome reports of programs to encourage privatization turning into boondoggles for contractors, or new anticorruption agencies dissolved or made toothless by those in power.\n        This is no time to cut off the world's poor, especially for programs with such an uncertain record.

If a buffer ever existed between them and the lawmakers they seek to influence, it was breached long ago.\n        When they arrive for work, the Speaker of the Council and the chairs of major committees regularly hit a wall of glad-handing and generous lobbyists just outside their office doors. More than likely, these same lobbyists contributed to (and may even have helped manage) the political campaigns of the very people they're now asking for favors.\n        This kind of Jack Abramoff-on-the-Hudson scenario has made a lot of lobbyists wealthy, and pumped up many a local political career. But the coziness has been a huge disservice to New York voters, whose interests have regularly been trumped by those with the money to hire lobbyists.\n        So it was refreshing when the city's two leading political forces recently joined to reform lobbying. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Christine Quinn, the Council's speaker, proposed new rules that include a complete ban on gifts -- a mostly symbolic ban, since it would replace a limit of only $50. They also called for a fuller accounting of lobbyists' activities, including fundraising and consulting. Ms. Quinn has vowed to severely limit lobbyists' access to her colleagues on the Council.\n        In addition, to limit the influence of lobbyists' campaign contributions, the two officials proposed ending publicly-funded matches that treat lobbyists' donations like everyone else's. Right now, a lobbyist's contribution of $250 is eligible for the standard taxpayer match, in this case $1000.\n        These are impressive proposals. But legislation must still be written, the technology to track lobbyists must still be designed, and most important, the mayor and the Council will need to come to an agreement on how to enforce the regulations.\n        The current system puts the City Clerk, who is appointed by the Council, in charge of enforcing lobbying laws that mostly affect Council members. The clerk's primary job is dealing with matters of record in the city. Finding lobbying information online requires navigating from a site called nycmarriagebureau.com. It's hardly a shock, but not a single lobbying violation has been detected in the last five years, although lobbyists getting married at least had to answer questions about that.\n        This is clearly no way to enforce bold new rules. Someone has to be assigned the task of seeking out violations and attacking them with real teeth, and given the resources and authority to do so. Besides the lobbyists who can be seen and heard, there is much behind-the-scenes influence-peddling that also needs addressing -- for example, lawyers who lobby and then hide behind client-attorney privilege. As things now stand, the full extent of the lobbying problem can only be guessed at.\n        If the announcement last week had a rushed quality about it, it may have been because good government groups like Citizens Union were raising pointed questions about influence peddlers. The mayor alluded to the need to take action now, saying that his purpose was to strengthen the integrity of city government before there is a ''lurid tinge of scandal.'' We hope Mayor Bloomberg and Speaker Quinn can concoct the means to match that worthy end, and soon.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1690129,"ids":1690129,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"London's bombings continue to echo throughout the urban world. In New York City, commuters have been facing random searches of backpacks, duffel bags and briefcases by police officers who are trying to thwart a potential terrorist attack. The extra precautions, originally planned to continue for a few weeks, have already drawn complaints from some civil libertarians.\n        The searches must be done in an evenhanded manner. They must also be done for far longer than a few weeks.\n        Travelers have long since gotten used to extensive searches before they board airplanes, and they should be relieved to see security measures on the subways and commuter trains as well. The New York City Police Department seems to have taken some pains to make sure that people's constitutional rights are respected. It has, to its credit, issued a directive that while people who refuse to have their belongings examined can be stopped from riding the subways, no one can be arrested simply for leaving and not allowing a search.\n        The police officers must be careful not to give the impression that every rider who looks Arab or South Asian is automatically a subject of suspicion. They will naturally choose to search the bags of those people who appear suspicious, like those wearing bulky clothes in warm weather. But those who are selected simply because they are carrying packages should be chosen in a way that does not raise fears of racial profiling -- by, for example, searching every 5th or 12th person, with the exact sequence chosen at random.\n        Finding a way to treat people fairly and still pursue any real threat is a particularly difficult and important task in a city as diverse as New York. The last thing the city or the Police Department needs is a shooting like the one in London last week, when officers misjudged the situation and gunned down a Brazilian immigrant who had nothing to do with that city's bombings.\n        Making sure that the searches and other security measures are continuing and widespread may be harder than keeping them constitutional. New York City has doubled the number of officers patrolling the subway system since the London bombings on July 7, at a cost of about $1.9 million a week in overtime. That is a national defense burden that Washington should be ready to shoulder quickly, not only for New York, but for every large mass transit system in an area that is judged a likely terrorist target.\n        Protecting the New York subways -- and subways in Washington, Atlanta and other cities -- against terrorists is a vital national interest. Congress has been favoring pork over risk in giving the states money for homeland defense, but it can now show that it takes the lesson of London seriously by making more money available for this weak link in the nation's defenses. Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary -- who, in a recent unfortunate quotation, appeared to dismiss the federal government's duty to protect subway riders -- must make this an urgent priority.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1820290,"ids":1820290,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Long Island on a map looks like one big flat fishy slab, but maps are deceptive. Politically, it's an archipelago: a chain of hundreds of governmental bodies, all separate and independent, and all floating in a sea of taxes.\n        The proliferation of overlapping taxing districts -- counties, towns, villages, hamlets, fire departments, school systems, sanitary districts -- has left Long Islanders in a trap. They love the amenities of multiple governments but ache under the burden of paying for them all. The cost of living here keeps rising in ways that seem beyond anyone's control, since things like garbage collection and gleaming firetrucks, while expensive, are also seen as essential. Or, if not essential, then at least immovable. In many cases the taxing districts have become politically tenacious fiefdoms: secretive, highly fortified and resistant to siege.\n        People like to complain about the problem, but it took the Nassau Comptroller, Howard Weitzman, to sink his watchdog's teeth into it. Last month he issued a report highlighting ways that the more than 200 special taxing districts in Nassau -- whose total tax bill was more than $473 million last year -- can save large amounts of money.\n        But not, he says, by dissolving themselves or consolidating with other districts. These options have often been suggested, most recently by Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who wants to create a Commission on Local Government Efficiency to study the problem across the state, which has more than 4,200 taxing districts. Instead, Mr. Weitzman proposes smart trimming around the edges of the problem by imposing greater oversight and by pooling resources.\n        The first line of defense against special-district overspending -- watchful voters -- is faulty, since special-district elections are obscure rituals in which only the tiniest sliver of the electorate participates. So Mr. Weitzman suggests that town governments step in to control spending. As he interprets state law, towns have the authority to review the budgets of special districts, to compel them to justify expenses and to trim their budgets as needed. Two of Nassau's three towns -- North Hempstead and Oyster Bay -- have already begun doing so. The third, Hempstead, should join them.\n        Mr. Weitzman's report outlines common-sense ways districts could band together to reduce insurance costs, pooling their risk through group self-insurance and saving money that would otherwise be spent unecessarily on brokers' fees and redundant contracts with private insurance companies. The same cooperation could apply to buying goods and services in bulk, or contracting with town governments for services like snow plowing and tree pruning at rates cheaper than those charged by private companies.\n        If there was ever any doubt that special-district spending could be tightened, it was shattered in 2005. That was the year Mr. Weitzman conducted eye-opening audits of sanitary districts in Nassau, finding numerous examples of wastefulness and lack of oversight, and Newsday published a series of articles detailing the sometimes grotesquely lavish spending by volunteer fire districts across Long Island. Mr. Spitzer's commission has not yet gotten off the ground. When it does, it would do well to take a page, or several, from Mr. Weitzman's report.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1779419,"ids":1779419,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Long Islanders who know Thomas Suozzi know that his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor of New York could be a credible one, but for the following: nobody knows him, his ads have been ineffective and he has been unable to shorten the overwhelming distance between him and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in the polls.\n        But in their debate last week -- an hour of rapid fire sparring that somehow generated both heat and light -- Mr. Suozzi attacked the front running Mr. Spitzer with a punchy effectiveness rarely seen in a single digit candidate.\n        Mr. Spitzer punched back, and the voters won. New Yorkers outside Long Island who had known nothing about Mr. Suozzi or had only a hazy notion of where he and Mr. Spitzer stood on the issues got inklings, at least, as well as a sense of whose ideas might be worth listening to, and where the troubling gaps and lingering questions might lie. The debate did a lot to pull the campaign into focus.\n        Voters deserve to see Mr. Spitzer tested, and Mr. Suozzi has now shown himself perfectly capable of doing that. When asked -- by Mr. Suozzi -- why Mr. Suozzi should not be governor, Mr. Spitzer had no answer. Mr. Suozzi effectively harried Mr. Spitzer over his refusal to hire outside counsel to represent the state when he disagreed with the governor.\n        Mr. Spitzer's counterattacks, meanwhile, distorted Mr. Suozzi's record -- Nassau County's fiscal recovery was not, as Mr. Spitzer claimed, merely a case of raising taxes, and Mr. Suozzi is not the simplistic tax-and-spender that Mr. Spitzer made him out to be.\n        In our ideal primary campaign, the candidates would revisit and amplify those and other points of disagreement. Mr. Suozzi, too, would clarify his own positions -- on why, say, a mere $2.5 billion would be enough to satisfy a court order to increase financing for New York City schools, when court estimates of what the schools need each year are easily twice that amount.\n        Regrettably, though, Tuesday's debate was to have been the first and last of the campaign, and now that it is out of the way, Mr. Spitzer may find it possible simply to coast on to November, ignoring all the underdog yapping coming from the Suozzi camp. And while Mr. Suozzi may have sunk some baskets on Tuesday, he will need a lot of unanswered three-pointers to win the game.\n        The small knot of Suozzi supporters who cheered and sang outside the debate hall at Pace University were a telling indication of the state of his candidacy. They had plenty of boisterous energy, but they also had a lot of unused campaign signs, which they dumped into piles when they went to a nearby bar for a post-debate party.\n        The plain truth is that Mr. Suozzi has so far not fulfilled his promise to mount a potent challenge to Mr. Spitzer, or even to be a speed bump on Mr. Spitzer's flower-strewn path to the governor's mansion. Even so, it is hard for us to tell him not to stick with it. And while few believe that Mr. Suozzi has any real chance of becoming governor, Mr. Suozzi himself seems to think he does. As the curious, substance-hungry voters who tuned in Tuesday night discovered, that's not a bad thing at all.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1768230,"ids":1768230,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Long and hot. That's the forecast for the summer of 2006 -- that is, if you are a member of the New Jersey Legislature.\n        There will be no mass exodus to Cape May Ocean City or Spring Lake once legislators pass a budget later this month. The Senate president, Richard Codey, and the Assembly speaker, Joseph Roberts, have scheduled a special session in July to discuss the eternal issue of property tax reform.\n        Gov. Jon Corzine's bad-news budget, the minirevolt that led to voter rejection of nearly half of the state's school budgets and the absence of any legislative elections this fall make the summer of 2006 as good a time as any to tackle the state's perilous finances. The question is whether the special session will yield substantative discussion of difficult issues or the lawmakers will simply issue a stack of press releases before turning their attention to more congenial summertime pursuits.\n        At the moment, there seems to be some inclination to begin talking about previously unmentionable issues like New Jersey's devotion to home rule. Mr. Roberts, a Democrat from Camden County, seems determined to inspire a debate about shared services -- a touchy subject because it seems to threaten the identities, and bureaucracies, of New Jersey's 560 or so self-governing municipalities.\n        Mr. Roberts points out that New Jersey has more than 300 laws meant to encourage neighboring municipalities to save money by sharing or consolidating services like education and police and fire protection. But these laws are as irrelevant as the speed limit on the Garden State Parkway on a Friday night in summer. In theory governments can share services, just as in theory one can zip along the parkway at 55 miles an hour for a weekend at the Jersey Shore. But try doing it.\n        ''If two towns want to consolidate services, residents naturally fear that their town will be taken over by the other,'' Mr. Roberts points out. ''In a state like ours, the name of a neighborhood or town matters. You have to try to preserve that sense of identity.''\n        With that in mind, he is trying to to make it easier for local governments to share services without sacrificing their separate identities. Among other things, he would streamline those 300-plus laws, and tie some state grants to efficient delivery of services. He points to the township model, where small communities retain their identities even as basic services are delivered by a larger municipality.\n        That is an ambitious agenda, one that will take more than a few weeks in summertime to address. It is, however, a step in the right direction.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1777601,"ids":1777601,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Louisiana has begun the long process of distributing federal housing aid, giving hurricane-ravaged homeowners a chance to rebuild at last. It is only a pilot program as officials try to work the kinks out, but the doors are open at the first of what will be 10 offices, and checks should begin to arrive in August. At the same time, debris removal and the demolition of ruined houses have finally sped up. The number of permits issued by the city for home renovations continues to rise. And there is optimism in many corners about the Katrina-induced reform of New Orleans's troubled old school system.\n        These are hopeful signs for a city that has seen so much suffering, so many setbacks, but let's not forget where we really are. When the hurricane ended, did anyone imagine that nearly 11 months later there would be no citywide rebuilding plan? No one warned evacuees that many would still be in a cramped, miserable, unemployed stasis as Katrina's anniversary approached. Over a quarter of displaced evacuees remain jobless, compared with just 5.9 percent of those who could return.\n        It is a rebuilding effort on an unprecedented scale, but that is no excuse for dithering. There will be some waste and there will be some bad feelings; the effort is too large and too complicated for there not to be. We do not want haste, but people have a right to demand urgency.\n        While the federal government has designated $107.8 billion for the Gulf Coast, only a fraction is for long-term reconstruction. The money is spread across five states, from Florida to Texas. Much has already been spent on the immediate sheltering of evacuees and the ill-conceived trailer program.\n        New Orleans will rise again only with the help of private banks and builders. But without a clear plan for the city, developers don't know where they can build and where they can't. Everyone is waiting for someone to take the lead. The federal government and the state have done their part. The city is still playing catch-up.\n        Where some see progress, others see a comeback stalled. A Brookings Institution report found that the availability of public services like transportation and health care had gone flat. Evacuees wishing to return are plagued by a shortage of houses. As a result, the rent for a one-bedroom apartment has risen to $803, using a government fair-market estimate, compared with $578 before the storm. Those trying to rebuild have watched the cost of construction materials go up by 20 percent. And even as the power company pushes for a big rate increase, the city is still without reliable electrical service.\n        Without sufficient progress, residents may opt to take state buyouts rather than tackle the difficult task of rebuilding. City leaders need to realize that they are still in a fight for the city's survival. The road home leads out of town as well.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1684108,"ids":1684108,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Lung cancer is such a remorseless killer that any gain against it is reason for applause. That is why the latest news about startling improvements in treating early-stage victims of the most common form of lung cancer is especially heartening.\n        Lung cancer will kill more than 160,000 Americans this year, making it the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Those found to have the disease have, on average, only a 15 percent chance of surviving for five years, mostly because the cancer has already invaded nearby regions or spread to distant sites by the time it is detected.\n        Even when the disease has been detected at a relatively early stage, surgery to cut out the tumor has had only moderate success. Some 20 percent of all lung cancer patients have surgery, but only 30 to 60 percent survive for five years after treatment, depending on the size and status of their tumors.\n        Now a report says that adding chemotherapy after surgery can greatly improve the survival rate. A paper published recently in The New England Journal of Medicine described the results of a 10-year clinical trial with 482 patients, half of whom had received two chemotherapy drugs after surgery.\n        The patients all had early stages of non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of the disease. Of those given the drugs, cisplatin and vinorelbine, 69 percent were alive five years later, compared with only 54 percent of the control group. Over all, the patients given chemotherapy lived for 94 months, while those who had surgery without the added drugs lived only 73 months.\n        In a field where gains are often marginal, these advances were hailed as ''stunning'' and ''astonishing'' by leading experts. About 50,000 people a year in this country will probably be candidates for the combined surgical and drug treatment. If all of them received the combined treatment, some 7,500 more people per year might survive for five years after treatment, a significant gain.\n        Still, the overall outlook for lung cancer patients remains gloomy. There is no accepted screening test to detect lung cancer early, when it is most treatable, and chemotherapy does not work well against the most advanced stages. Only 2 to 8 percent of those patients survive for five years.\n        Smoking remains the main cause of lung cancer, accounting for perhaps 90 percent of the deaths. While smoking rates have been inching down, they are still alarmingly high. The best cure for lung cancer is to prevent it, by not smoking and by avoiding the exhalations of those who do.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1692083,"ids":1692083,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Tehran mayor who won a landslide victory in Iran's presidential elections in June, will begin his term today. The rest of the world will be watching his performance with interest, to say the least.\n        Iran has been escalating tensions on the nuclear front. This week a senior Iranian official announced plans to resume the country's nuclear program by removing the seals placed by the United Nations' nuclear agency at a site where uranium is converted into a gas for enrichment. Europe, which has taken the lead in dealing with Iran's nuclear ambitions, responded with incoherence.\n        First, European officials threatened to end negotiations and take the matter to the United Nations Security Council -- presumably to bring up the issue of sanctions. But since China dislikes sanctions, any such proposal would probably run into a veto. France, Germany and Britain then followed up with pleas to Tehran not to do anything because they are just days away from delivering a package of incentives as part of their effort to bribe Iran to keep it from enriching its uranium.\n        Given all this floundering, it was a welcome piece of news when a new United States intelligence assessment projected that Iran was farther away from a nuclear weapons capability than had been thought. The most likely time frame would be the early or middle years of the next decade, it said.\n        Meanwhile in Tehran, Mr. Ahmadinejad has other disturbing issues awaiting his attention. For one, there's the failing health of Akbar Ganji, a jailed journalist who is now on a hunger strike. And, even though assassinations are rare in Iran, the judge in Mr. Ganji's trial was killed yesterday. Then there's the recent arrest of Abdolfattah Soltani, a lawyer who defended Mr. Ganji and also worked with Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner. Ms. Ebadi has been successful enough as a champion of human rights that she is now being accused in government-controlled news media reports of a slew of absurd charges, including burglary.\n        Untangling all of this will determine whether Mr. Ahmadinejad is the independent populist he claimed to be during the campaign, or just another pawn of the clerical power brokers who backed him. No Iranian president to date has ever been able to defy the wishes of the unelected ayatollahs who rule Iran, and it is highly unlikely that Mr. Ahmadinejad will prove to be any different. Still, he ran on an economic platform that implicitly challenged the cronyism and corruption of clerical rule. It would be a welcome surprise if a radical conservative like Mr. Ahmadinejad could cut a nuclear deal, just as the fiercely anti-Communist Richard Nixon was able to reach out to Communist China.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1773358,"ids":1773358,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Many of the nations that have left the United States behind in math and science have ministries of education with clear mandates when it comes to educational quality control. The American system, by contrast, celebrates local autonomy for its schools. When Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act, it tried to address the quality control problem through annual tests, which the states were supposed to administer in exchange for federal dollars. But things have not quite worked out as planned.\n        A startling new study shows that many states have a longstanding tradition of setting basement-level educational standards and misleading the public about student performance. The patterns were set long before No Child Left Behind, and it will require more than just passing a law to change them.\n        Policy Analysis for California Education (PACE), a research institute run jointly by Stanford and the University of California, showed that in many states students who performed brilliantly on state tests scored dismally on the federal National Assessment of Educational Progress, which is currently the strongest, most well-respected test in the country.\n        The study analyzed state-level testing practices from 1992 to 2005. It found that many states were dumbing down their tests or shifting the proficiency targets in math and reading, creating a fraudulent appearance of progress and making it impossible to tell how well students were actually performing.\n        Not all states have tried to evade the truth. The tests in Massachusetts, for example, yield performance results that are reasonably close to the federal standard. Not so for states like Oklahoma, where the score gap between state and federal tests has averaged 48 points in reading and 60 points in math, according to the PACE report. The states that want to mislead the government -- and their own residents -- use a variety of dodges, including setting passing scores low, using weak tests and switching tests from year to year to prevent unflattering comparisons over time. These strategies become transparent when the same students who perform so well on state tests do poorly on the more rigorous federal exam. Most alarming of all, the PACE study finds that the gap between student reading performance on the state and federal tests has actually grown wider over time  -- which suggests that claims of reading progress in many states are in fact phony.\n        States have always resisted the idea of one national set of tests, citing local autonomy. But if the United States wants to equal its competitors abroad, it must move away from a patchwork system based on weak standards and a frankly fraudulent system of student assessment. Under one promising proposal, the government would finance creation of a rigorous, high-quality test that would be provided free to the states -- as long as they agreed to use federal scoring standards. That would finally give the country an accurate and all-encompassing view of student performance.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1659245,"ids":1659245,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Maybe Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel doesn't quite get it yet, but this new era of hope in the Middle East means he needs to restrain his instincts for settlement building.\n        On Monday, Israel publicly confirmed plans to expand the already large settlement a few miles east of Jerusalem called Maale Adumim. In a community already housing 30,000 residents -- not to mention a Blockbuster Video, Ace Hardware and other shops -- Israel plans to build an additional 3,500 new housing units.\n        The Palestinians have rightly criticized this as a major obstacle to ever resolving one of the most emotional and intractable issues between the two: the final borders of Israel and eventually Palestine, and the dividing up of Jerusalem.\n        We all know that any final peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians will have to include an adjustment of borders; returning to the 1967 lines is fine in theory, but there are too many Israeli Jews living outside those boundaries to expect all of them to move. But that is precisely why adding to those numbers right now is so cynical. And claims by the Israelis that they never intend to give certain settlements back anyway just don't cut it.\n        Mr. Sharon is unfairly trying to stack the deck before peace talks even begin by expanding the Jewish presence around the traditionally Arab eastern parts of Jerusalem. Such a move could further seal off those Israeli Arabs in east Jerusalem from Palestinian areas in the West Bank.\n        Mr. Sharon deserves credit for the upcoming withdrawal of Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip. The disengagement promises to be emotionally gut-wrenching, pitting young Israeli soldiers against Zionist settlers who believe that God gave them the land from which they're about to be evacuated. But building new settlements is the wrong way to ease that political pressure.\n        Israel can't simply exchange Gaza for more settlements in the West Bank. There is no realistic substitute for a negotiated resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, and such a pact will never happen without Israeli withdrawal of most of its settlements. That's withdrawal, not expansion.\n        The Maale Adumim expansion is also a slap in the face of the new Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. Mr. Abbas, at his own political peril, has gone further in three months toward making peace with Israel than Yasir Arafat ever did.\n        But the Palestinian people must have confidence that their new leader can eventually get them a fair deal; that their growing willingness to lay down their arms will one day win for them an independent Palestine with enough land in the West Bank and Gaza to make a viable country. How is Mr. Abbas supposed to make that case when Mr. Sharon is building more settlements?\n        President Bush has done an admirable job since the death of Mr. Arafat in applying the right amount of carrots to encourage the Palestinians to start acting as if they're interested in a real peace deal.

We're going to be waiting to see how well he and Mr. Klein deliver on his promise to make this questionable deal pay off.\n        As of right now, the arguments that the contract could not be put out to competitive bidding seem thin. Mr. Klein's choice was the consulting firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal, a New York-based group that has stepped in to reorganize everything from the government of Orange County, Calif., to the company that makes Twinkies. The firm also has experience working with school systems in St. Louis and New Orleans.\n        The city's Public Advocate, Betsy Gotbaum, is demanding an investigation of the consultants' previous work with those two educational systems. That's not unreasonable, but even if the work in St. Louis and New Orleans went well, finding ways to save money and streamline systems in a medium-sized city with completely dysfunctional schools is very different from working in New York, with its $15 billion budget, 1.1. million students and 80,000 teachers. For all its problems, New York's system has also been the target of reform efforts by several different chancellors over the last decade. Many of the more obvious fixes have been made.\n        But Mr. Klein, who first hired Alvarez &amp; Marsal for a few months of work that was paid for by private donations, quickly signed the firm for the big project, which is being paid for by taxpayers and involves more money than all the department's no-bid contracts awarded in the last fiscal year. He says the firm has already produced savings that has sent nearly $50 million to the schools for the hiring of more than 300 teachers and other workers.\n        As they've tackled a myriad of education problems, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Klein -- who both lack previous education management experience -- have frequently shown a lack of respect for the education department's own experts. While both men clearly have the schools' best interests at heart, it's sometimes hard to tell whether their eagerness to reach outside for help is based on real need or a simple impatience with people who don't fit the corporate model. And in the past they have not always been right. In 2003, they rushed a no-bid contract to put Snapple soft drinks in the schools, a deal criticized by Comptroller Bill Thompson. It produced only a fraction of the profit promised.\n        In the not-so-long-ago bad old days, whenever the Department of Education wanted to enter into a contract over $50,000, an approval required a request for bids, a public hearing and a vote by the school board. Nobody wants to go back to that cumbersome process again. But in this case, the mayor and his schools chancellor haven't done the argument for expediency much good.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1712278,"ids":1712278,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Mayor Michael Bloomberg has made it clear that he wants more say over what happens with the former World Trade Center site. Anybody who yearns for a speedy revival of Lower Manhattan should applaud the mayor's re-entry into this difficult arena. But we should also make certain New York's mayor stays involved in one of the most important and emotionally fraught urban renewal projects in the nation's history.\n        Four years after the attack at ground zero, the rebuilding is progressing in fits and starts. And Gov. George Pataki, who holds many of the levers of power, seems to be losing the political will needed to continue dealing fairly with all of the complicated interests involved. So we welcome Mayor Bloomberg to the fray and have some ideas about how he can help.\n        First, the mayor should breathe life into the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the quasi-private entity set up to run the planning and rebuilding of the site. Governor Pataki gave the corporation's hard-working and prestigious board a swift kick in the stomach last month when he caved in to a group of victims' relatives and squashed the long-planned International Freedom Center at the site. Already the governor's action has resulted in the resignation of Roland Betts, a key member of the corporation's board. But other board members are said to be angry and demoralized. Mr. Bloomberg, who gets to choose eight members of the board, has four vacancies to fill. This would be an ideal time for the mayor to pick energetic and powerful new members, like the head of Goldman Sachs or the president of Pace University downtown.\n        Mr. Bloomberg has also let it be known that he would like for the city to buy out or find some other way to get free of Larry Silverstein, the developer who held the lease of the trade center when it was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. While Mr. Silverstein might not be the ideal developer for this site, moving him at this stage might only further slow an already slow process of rebuilding.\n        Mr. Bloomberg's main complaint about Mr. Silverstein seems to be the push to restore the same square footage of commercial space that was once housed in the twin towers -- about 10 million square feet. The mayor is pitching more apartments for the booming residential market downtown. As slowly as the rebuilding is going, Mr. Bloomberg should have enough time to argue for a readjustment of the square footage in future buildings to more residential than commercial space.\n        It would be easy to criticize the mayor for being tardy here, especially since he wasted so much energy promoting the stadium on Manhattan's West Side. But now he has turned to a problem in his city that not only deserves his attention, but also needs a strong and thoughtful leader to go forward.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1669422,"ids":1669422,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Mayor Michael Bloomberg's obsession with building a football stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan is in danger of leaving other development projects in its shadow -- including the rebuilding of ground zero. Since Lower Manhattan is where Melville began the saga of ''Moby-Dick,'' it seems appropriate to wonder whether Mr. Bloomberg is turning into a modern-day Ahab, pursuing his great white elephant of a stadium as the former World Trade Center site sinks into trouble.\n        Lower Manhattan isn't the only issue that seems to be left in the lurch while the mayor devotes a disproportionate amount of energy to getting the Jets and new office buildings on the Far West Side and landing the Olympics. Governors Island has been standing lonely and empty out in the harbor while years of talk about development have come to nothing. But shepherding the rebirth of the site of the terrorist attack should rebound to the top of Mr. Bloomberg's priority list. That's true for Gov. George Pataki as well. Mr. Pataki too often gets distracted -- by the elections or the state budget, or, lately, his vague quest for higher office. The governor won't have a political future to worry about if he doesn't keep a clearer eye on the very complicated rebuilding of the World Trade Center site.\n        One of the reasons for the sudden sense of crisis downtown is that the Police Department -- headed by one of the officials closest to Mr. Bloomberg -- has suddenly come up with new, detailed security plans that could require substantial changes in the development plans. Security is obviously critical, but since the police and the deputy mayor have been sitting in on planning sessions since the beginning, it's both strange and disturbing that this sudden shift of course is occurring at this late stage. The mayor needs to be at the center of efforts to make the revitalization of downtown work.\n        This is also the time for Mr. Bloomberg to be making an all-out effort to persuade Goldman Sachs, whose new building was supposed to be a critical anchor for the area, to rethink its plans to move elsewhere in the city. The mayor's staff insists that he has been engaged in every corner of the city. One way to prove that would be to keep such financial stalwarts as Goldman Sachs downtown.\n        As for the Freedom Tower, right now engineers, architects and the developer are all scrambling to figure out how to deal with the new police security standards as quickly as possible. The master plan designer, Daniel Libeskind, has already sketched a few possibilities for turning the office tower into a thinner building, set back farther from the street and merged with the cultural center. It is an interesting possibility that deserves to be part of the give-and-take between Mr. Libeskind and David Childs, who is the architect for the lead developer, Larry Silverstein.\n        Mr. Silverstein, who wants the maximum amount of office space, is not likely to be enamored with the idea. But the bottom line cannot be the bottom line here. The tower must be designed to be a spectacular focal point that will draw people to live, work and visit. Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg know that and sometimes even say that. Now it's time to put some sustained energy behind those convictions.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1660243,"ids":1660243,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg assured the city last year that forcing some third graders to repeat the year and sending thousands of others to summer school would ensure that students who reached fourth grade were actually prepared to succeed.\n        That sounded promising. But the effectiveness of Mr. Bloomberg's program has been called into question. Nearly a third of New York's fourth graders -- roughly the same percentage as last year -- recently received warnings that they were in danger of being held back.\n        This could be a statistical aberration. It could also signify deeper trouble in the schools, including problems with basic reading instruction in the primary grades.\n        City officials say that the large number of letters stemmed not from any shortcoming in the strategy but from the fact that the schools broadened the definition of students who need extra help. Only a fraction of those who received warning letters will actually be held back, they said, describing the letters as a wake-up call to the parents of children who need special attention.\n        But scaring people by making empty threats is not the smartest way to get your point across. The system should have less explosive ways of reaching out to parents so that problems are dealt with earlier in the year. Letters that upset families and inevitably stigmatize students should be issued only as a last resort and for good cause.\n        Instead, the city needs to look closely at the children who received warning letters in both third and fourth grades. Continued failure in this group could suggest problems with instruction in the primary grades, as well as flaws in the remedial summer programs that are supposed to bring the children up to speed in reading.\n        The city is said to have revised its reading curriculum last year after the federal government threatened to withhold aid and criticized the program as being too loosely structured. Even so, the city needs to keep getting better in this area. Struggling students need smaller classes and the strongest possible instruction.\n        City officials should also check into suggestions that the school districts are using too much valuable instruction time for test preparation. A study last year by the nonpartisan Educational Priorities Panel suggested that the system was drifting in that direction even before Mr. Bloomberg took office.\n        A recent survey by the United Federation of Teachers found chronic complaints about this issue. More than half of the teachers surveyed said that they spent five hours or more a week of classroom time preparing students for standardized tests. That strategy might raise scores in the short run, but over time it robs students of the basic skills they need to succeed in the upper grades.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1661997,"ids":1661997,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is doing more to clean up New York's garbage problem than might have been expected when he took office. The recycling program, parts of which he suspended early on, owes its revival to him. Now he wants get rid of the diesel-belching trucks that haul away most of the city's 50,000 tons of rubbish daily. There are still questions to be answered involving costs and the ultimate destination of the trash. But on balance the plan seems responsible and forward-looking. This being an election year, though, that may not be enough.\n        The mayor wants to retrofit or rebuild existing marine and rail transfer stations in every borough. The garbage would be shipped from these sites either by barge or by railcar. But getting the garbage to the sites would inevitably mean an increase in street traffic from shorthauling garbage trucks. This is not an attractive prospect for local residents.\n        One of these sites would be a former marine transfer station on East 91st Street in Manhattan, on the Upper East Side between the East River and FDR Drive. By almost any standard, that site is a questionable selection. It would be check-by-jowl with residential buildings -- closer to where people live than any other station in the mayor's proposal -- and it would handle less rubbish than any other, possibly making it the least cost-effective.\n        The station, perhaps not coincidentally, would be in the home district of Gifford Miller, the council speaker, who hopes to unseat Mr. Bloomberg.\n        This unseemly mix of politics and trash is not new. After all, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had the interest of his Staten Island political base in mind when he closed the Fresh Kills landfill, without a backup plan. The result was battalions of 18-wheelers hauling garbage out of state, increasing costs, pollution and health risks.\n        We agree that the burden of handling trash should be equitably distributed. Less privileged neighborhoods like Greenpoint-Williamsburg and the South Bronx have borne most of the load for too long. The Bloomberg plan wisely seeks to make each borough self-sufficient in handling its waste. Most of Manhattan's unrecyclable, residential trash would still be trucked to a New Jersey incinerator. That leaves about 700 tons a day to be handled at East 91st Street.\n        This load could be diverted to another site. Manhattan has two others planned, in the West Village and at West 59th Street. The city says they are spoken for, respectively handling recycling and commercial trash. But surely that cannot be the end of the discussion. Mr. Miller should offer workable alternatives and he must not throw out the mayor's plan to serve his own political ends. But neither should Mr. Bloomberg sabotage his own blueprint by stubbornly insisting on every aspect of his original proposal. This is a disagreement that can and should be worked out.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":18,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1804699,"ids":1804699,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Michael Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, says he does not want the power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, but Democrats should give it to him anyway.\n        The Democrats have pledged to move on the issue as soon as they take control of Congress. If they succeed, it would allow an important test of the hypothesis that government negotiators can wring lower prices from the manufacturers than those obtained by the private drug plans and pharmaceutical benefit managers that currently negotiate on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries.\n        The 2003 Medicare drug law -- written by a Republican-dominated Congress in thrall to big drug company contributors -- explicitly prohibits the federal government from negotiating drug prices or establishing a list of preferred drugs.\n        The Democrats are only beginning to explore what they want the government to do. Some advocates want the government to mandate hefty discounts for all Medicare drug purchases -- an approach that some experts fear could deprive the industry of revenues needed to develop new drugs. Others would have officials step in only when private plans prove inept or when there is no alternative to a high-priced drug.\n        The approach that most appeals to us would direct the secretary of health and human services to set up one or more government-operated drug plans to compete with the private plans. That could be started while the new Congress holds hearings to examine broader possibilities.\n        There is no guarantee that government negotiators would do better. Medicare's chief actuary concluded last year that the government would be unlikely to get bigger discounts, and the head of the Congressional Budget Office judged in 2004 that for most drugs that was true. Some experts believe the government would not press manufacturers hard, because of the lobbying clout of the pharmaceutical industry and of Medicare beneficiaries seeking access to the newest (and most expensive) medicines.\n        Right now, private plans are not doing all that well at obtaining discounts for their clients. Surveys by House Democrats, consumer groups and academic experts have found that the prices charged to beneficiaries when their coverage runs out -- a rough surrogate, perhaps, for what the plans actually paid for the drugs -- are significantly higher than the drug prices negotiated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Medicaid program for the poor, and foreign governments, among others.\n        President Bush might be inclined to veto any bill that tried to insert the government into price negotiations. But if presented with a bill to set up government-operated drug plans to go head to head with the private plans, he would have to explain why he is afraid of a real market competition.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1654540,"ids":1654540,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Military veterans are crying foul over President Bush's budget proposals to cut spending on their health care. The budget must not be balanced ''on the backs of veterans,'' wrote Stephen P. Condon, the chairman of the Air Force Association, in a recent letter to The Times, a point that was echoed by other veterans at Congressional hearings last month. We agree with the veterans -- but for somewhat different reasons than they have put forth.\n        The veterans' goal is to block the president's attempt to impose new hospital fees, higher prescription co-payments and other spending constraints -- all of which would add up to an estimated 16 percent reduction in veterans' benefits in 2010. (The estimate is from the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities because the administration, breaking with 16 years of budget tradition, did not provide five-year projections for specific programs.) But if veterans succeed in preserving only their own benefits, they will have been outfoxed by the administration.\n        Mr. Bush knows that wartime is no time to go after veterans' benefits. But by proposing changes that are politically implausible while challenging Congress to cut spending, the administration gains a bargaining chip: if lawmakers aren't willing to make the veterans' cuts the president has proposed, they will be pressured to make even deeper cuts in programs for people who don't have the veterans' ability to fight back.\n        In effect, Mr. Bush's budget pits veterans against the 660,000 women, infants and children whose food assistance is on the chopping block; against the 120,000 preschoolers who would be cut from Head Start; against the 370,000 families and disabled and elderly individuals who would lose rental assistance; against the whole communities that would lose support for clean air and drinking water; and so on.\n        The only way for veterans to avoid those unacceptable trade-offs is to refuse to fight on the president's terms. The size and scope of Mr. Bush's proposed spending cuts are a direct result of his refusal to ask for tax-cut rollbacks -- that is, to ask wealthy investors, who have had lavish, deficit-bloating tax cuts over the past four years, to contribute toward deficit reduction. On the contrary, Mr. Bush's budget proposes even more tax breaks, specifically for people with six-figure incomes or more and overflowing investment portfolios.\n        Most galling, the new tax cuts would be, in themselves, so large that the net spending cuts Mr. Bush has requested would not be enough to pay for them, let alone reduce the existing deficit.\n        Veterans have the moral and institutional clout to argue that no one group should be singled out to make sacrifices until all groups are asked to sacrifice. Bolstering that case is the fact that all successful deficit-cutting budgets have included tax increases on the affluent, including President Reagan's 1983 budget, the first President George Bush's 1991 budget and President Bill Clinton's 1994 budget. Mr. Bush's 2006 budget must do the same. If veterans drive that point home, the benefits they'll save will be their own, and those of many women and children, too.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1764904,"ids":1764904,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Minor league baseball in New Jersey has grown from a novelty to a cottage industry over the last dozen years. Eight farm teams toil in the Garden State -- up from zero in 1993.\n        Minor league baseball might seem like a growth industry, but growth surely is in the eye of the beholder. On a fine spring evening in Somerset County, where the Somerset Patriots regularly draw near-capacity crowds of more than 5,000 fans, baseball in New Jersey appears to be prospering. But a visit to stadiums in Atlantic City, Camden or Newark might offer a less sanguine view of the game's appeal.\n        Gov. Jon Corzine should take a hard look at a plan to add another team, this one in Bergen County. The developers of the Xanadu complex in the Meadowlands, along with a prospective team owner, Steve Kalafer, want to build a stadium in the sports complex for the new team. The state would contribute a $3 million loan and $10 million in bonds. The Xanadu developers -- the Mills Corporation and Mack-Cali -- would kick in $6 million, and Mr. Kalafer, $1 million. Mr. Kalafer would pay the state $1.15 million in annual rent for the park.\n        Before Mr. Corzine decides whether or not to commit scarce public money to this project, he should check out the Newark Bears, Camden Riversharks and the Atlantic City Surf, which all play in the independent Atlantic League with Mr. Kalafer's Patriots. There's a good chance he won't have a problem getting a good seat, nor will he face long lines for peanuts and Cracker Jack. The Bears, whose stadium on Broad Street cost Essex County taxpayers $34 million, are averaging about 2,700 fans a game this year in a ballpark built to hold about 6,000. The Riversharks are drawing about 3,300 people to their 6,400-seat stadium. And the Surf are managing to lure only about 1,300 people away from the casinos of Atlantic City.\n        The Bears in particular offer a cautionary tale: they were supposed to be part of Newark's renaissance. Their ballpark is convenient to highways as well as public transportation. Newark once was home to two minor-league teams, albeit more than a half-century ago. So the team hoped to capitalize on nostalgia -- always a smart strategy when selling baseball.\n        The team, however, has never caught on, despite the presence of former big-league stars like Rickey Henderson and Jose Canseco. Mr. Kalafer bought the franchise three years ago in hopes of replicating the success he has enjoyed as owner of the Patriots. But most fans still come disguised as empty seats.\n        It's true that some minor league teams, like the Lakewood Blue Claws, the Trenton Thunder and Mr. Kalafer's Patriots, draw impressive crowds. And there's no question that minor league baseball offers a family-friendly environment.\n        But how many teams can the state support? The record suggests that the market may already be saturated. Even hockey's New Jersey Devils and basketball's New Jersey Nets -- two big-league, winning franchises -- have trouble filling the Continental Airlines Arena, a fact that hardly bodes well for the Devils' new taxpayer-supported playground in downtown Newark.\n        One could go broke overestimating New Jersey's appetite for professional sports. That's something Mr. Corzine needs to consider.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1809448,"ids":1809448,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"More than 50 years after the Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education, the nation still has not abolished de facto segregation in public schools. But thanks to good will and enormous effort, some communities have made progress. Today the Supreme Court hears arguments in a pair of cases that could undo much of that work.\n        Conservative activists are seeking to halt the completely voluntary, and laudable, efforts by Seattle and Louisville, Ky., to promote racially integrated education. Both cities have school assignment plans known as managed or open choice. Children are assigned to schools based on a variety of factors, one of which is the applicant's race.\n        The plan that Jefferson County adopted for Louisville has a goal of having black enrollment in every school be no less than 15 percent and no more than 50 percent. Seattle assigns students to its 10 high schools based on a number of factors, including an ''integration tiebreaker.'' This tiebreaker, which is applied to students of all races, requires that an applicant's race be taken into account when a school departs by more than 15 percent from the district's overall racial breakdown.\n        Parents in both districts sued, alleging that the consideration of race is unconstitutional. In each case, the court of appeals upheld the assignment plans. In the Seattle case, Judge Alex Kozinski, a Reagan appointee who is highly respected by legal conservatives, wrote that because the district's plan does not advantage or disadvantage any particular racial group -- its pro-integration formula applies equally to all -- it ''carries none of the baggage the Supreme Court has found objectionable'' in other cases involving race-based actions.\n        The Louisville and Seattle plans are precisely the kind of benign race-based policies that the court has long held to be constitutional. Promoting diversity in education is a compelling state interest under the equal protection clause, and these districts are using carefully considered, narrowly tailored plans to make their schools more diverse.\n        It is startling to see the Justice Department, which was such a strong advocate for integration in the civil rights era, urging the court to strike down the plans. Its position is at odds with so much the Bush administration claims to believe. The federal government is asking federal courts to use the Constitution to overturn educational decisions made by localities. Conservative activists should be crying ''judicial activism,'' but they do not seem to mind this activism with an anti-integration agenda.\n        If these plans are struck down, many other cities' plans will most likely also have to be dismantled. In Brown, a unanimous court declared education critical for a child to ''succeed in life'' and held that equal protection does not permit it to be provided on a segregated basis. It would be tragic if the court changed directions now and began using equal protection to re-segregate the schools.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1647884,"ids":1647884,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Most Americans do not want to know how the meat they eat is produced, if only so they can continue to eat it. Nearly every aspect of meat production in America is disturbing, from the way animals are raised, to inadequate inspection of the final product. When it comes to what happens in the slaughterhouse, most of us mentally avert our eyes. Yet in the past decade, the handling of livestock on their way to the killing floor has actually been one of the parts of the business that has improved most significantly. What is most alarming at the slaughterhouse is not what happens to the animals -- they have already met their fate. It is what happens to the humans who work there.\n        A large slaughterhouse is the truly industrial end of industrial farming. It is a factory for disassembly. Its high line speeds place enormous pressure on the workers hired to take apart the carcasses coming down the line. And because the basic job of the line is cutting flesh -- hard, manual labor -- the dangers are very high for meat workers, whose flesh is every bit as vulnerable as that of the pork or beef or chicken passing by.\n        The problem of worker safety is compounded by the fact that meatpackers, driven by the brutal economics of the industry, always try to hire the cheapest labor they can find. That increasingly means immigrants whose language difficulties compound the risks of the job. The result, according to a new report by Human Rights Watch, is ''extraordinarily high rates of injury'' in conditions that systematically violate human rights.\n        In fact, the report finds, some major players in the American meat industry prey upon a large population of immigrant workers who are either ignorant of their fundamental rights or are undocumented aliens who are afraid of calling attention to themselves. As a result, those workers often receive little or no compensation for injuries, and any attempt to organize is met with hostility.\n        The industry has little incentive to improve conditions on its own, except a decent regard for human rights. The only reasonable prospect of improvement depends on the enforcement of federal and state law. Unfortunately, those laws at present are too weak and too riddled with loopholes to provide the regulations needed to increase worker safety and improve workers' rights. A systematic regulatory look at the meat industry, with an eye to toughening standards, is desperately needed.\n        In recent years, Americans have had the habit of thinking of wide-scale workplace abuses as foreign affairs -- the kind of thing that turns up in Southeast Asia, for instance. And, in a sense, the abuses found in American slaughterhouses are international matters, because so many of the workers are actually citizens of other countries. But in this case, the abuses are taking place right at home, and as part of our food chain. In a carb-conscious era, the meat processing industry should be a place of opportunity for workers who put all that protein on your plate. Right now, that is hardly the case.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1767931,"ids":1767931,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Most Palestinians are believed to favor a two-state solution that would acknowledge Israel's pre-1967 borders and thus, explicitly or implicitly, Israel's right to exist. But the Hamas-led government that Palestinians elected this year refuses any such gesture.\n        The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is now trying to exploit that inconsistency to force Hamas to endorse the mainstream Palestinian position and thereby make it possible to restart peace talks and renew international aid. He is prepared to call for a referendum next month to rally popular support behind his efforts.\n        We hope Mr. Abbas can succeed, despite some very serious problems with the specifics of the plan he is now promoting.\n        The vehicle that Mr. Abbas has seized upon to use as leverage with Hamas is a proposal put together by Palestinian prisoners now serving in Israel jails. Many of these come from Mr. Abbas's own political party, Fatah. But others come from Hamas. The proposal's political appeal to Palestinians comes from the popularity of its authorship and the ambivalence of some of its provisions. Its weaknesses as an actual peace plan come from some of those same ambivalences.\n        For example, unlike the unfulfilled Oslo agreements of the 1990's and the Arab League peace plan of 2002, the prisoners' proposal offers only implicit, not explicit, recognition to Israel. Even worse, it appears to legitimize Palestinian violence against Israelis in the West Bank and other occupied territories. And in contradiction to the spirit of a two-state solution, it asserts the right of Palestinian refugees to return to pre-1967 Israel.\n        For these and other reasons, the prisoners' proposal is unacceptable even to dovish Israelis, and, in its present form, can represent no more than an initial bargaining position. Serious talks could begin only after some of the plan's most glaring omissions and ambivalences have been remedied.\n        Five years ago, such a plan would have represented a step backward. But that was then. Today's climate is considerably bleaker. No real peace talks have taken place for more than five years. Current Israeli peace proposals talk mostly of unilaterally imposed boundaries. Palestinians have saddled themselves with a government that endorses terrorism, refuses to recognize Israel implicitly or explicitly and shuns any talk of a two-state solution. In this dark picture, Mr. Abbas's embrace of the prisoners' proposal, with all of its obvious problems, can only be greeted as a welcome step in the right direction.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1807892,"ids":1807892,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Much has changed in New York since Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was killed in a hail of 41 bullets fired by city police officers in 1999. Mr. Diallo's death sent racial tensions in the city nearly to a boiling point -- helped along by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who regularly shunned meetings with black leaders and failed to treat the crisis with the urgency it required.\n        Now Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, are dealing differently with their own Diallo-style disaster. Police officers firing 50 rounds early last Saturday killed Sean Bell, an unarmed man who was to have married his high school sweetheart later in the day. The mayor and the commissioner moved quickly to answer questions and to hear the concerns of the victim's family and the community. But their responsiveness will not bring back Sean Bell. The challenge here is far greater than good communications.\n        The officers who killed Mr. Bell were part of a sting operation at a Queens nightclub suspected of narcotics, prostitution and weapons violations. According to published reports, the officers have said that as Mr. Bell and his friends left the club and headed toward their car, an undercover detective heard one of them say he was going to get a gun. They also reportedly said that when the men entered the car, the detective pulled his gun and identified himself, but the car suddenly gunned forward, hit him in the shin and then struck an unmarked police minivan. The officers then opened fire.\n        The tragedy may simply involve two sets of very frightened men who reacted instinctively to what they thought was imminent danger. But only one of the sets was armed. There was no gun in the car, nor on the shooting victims, who sat helpless inside while five police officers began firing 50 rounds at them. One emptied his gun, a 9mm semiautomatic, reloaded and emptied it again, accounting for 31 rounds. The shooting appears to have been frantic, with bullets shattering windows as far away as the AirTrain station, hundreds of yards from the scene. Two of Mr. Bell's companions were injured; miraculously, there were no other casualties.\n        Unlike the Diallo tragedy, the officers involved in the Queens shooting were not all white. They were also not inexperienced. The first bullet came from an officer with five years on the job, and the detective who fired the 31 rounds had 12. But it is hard to explain their actions as anything but panic.\n        Police rules mandate that an officer pause after firing three rounds to assess the situation. If the shooters had followed procedures, they might have seen there was no threat before it was too late. Mayor Bloomberg has rightly called for a quick and impartial investigation. The officers must be held accountable for what has happened. But the Police Department must also confront the fact that a disaster that everyone swore to prevent seven years ago has repeated itself in Queens.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1721721,"ids":1721721,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Muscular diplomacy is one thing. But John Bolton has been all muscle and no diplomacy as the United States ambassador to the United Nations. Now he's threatening to hold up its entire two-year operating budget unless his demands for major reforms are met almost immediately.\n        As it happens, the American reform agenda contains many good elements. No one can seriously argue that the U.N. is a rationally structured, efficiently managed body. And letting countries like Cuba, Libya and Sudan sit on a human rights commission that judges the records of other countries diminishes the U.N.'s most important authority, its moral authority. But just as the Senate feared when it declined to confirm Mr. Bolton in the job, his blustering unilateral style is turning him into one of the biggest obstacles to achieving changes that had been within reach before he appeared on the scene.\n        Two basic changes are needed to repair the U.N.'s tarnished reputation. First, significant authority over appointments and management needs to be shifted from the General Assembly, which has 191 members, to the secretary general's office. Just as important, the secretary general (a new one will be chosen next year) must exercise this new authority wisely, boldly and effectively.\n        The most important specific reforms include establishing a permanent human rights council made up of countries that respect human rights, creating a commission to oversee the reconstruction of societies devastated by armed conflict, and giving the secretary general the authority to recommend ending missions that have outlived their usefulness and to make senior appointments based on merit, not regional quotas.\n        Doing these things will require a close alliance between reformers and the secretary general's office and the ability to convince General Assembly members that a more credible and effective U.N. is in their interests. Those are exactly the areas where Mr. Bolton has done the most damage. His demands and his threats to bypass the U.N. if it doesn't bow to them have fed the impression that the whole reform agenda is a power grab by Washington. Hard as it is for Americans to believe, much of the world now suspects Secretary General Kofi Annan of being Washington's lackey.\n        Mr. Annan made a promising start earlier this year at building a consensus for reform, only to have it derailed by Mr. Bolton. Soon after taking over the American mission this summer, he issued a long list of last-minute demands. As a result, a special international summit meeting that had been organized to adopt real reforms ended up endorsing a document that was mostly fudge and mush.\n        Mr. Bolton's latest threat, to block the next U.N. budget, is likely to be equally counterproductive. America's most successful U.N. ambassadors, whether they served Republican or Democratic presidents, have known how to harness American power to patient, skillful diplomacy. Regrettably, Mr. Bolton has failed to profit from their example.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1851769,"ids":1851769,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"MySpace.com, the Internet social networking site, has gained tens of millions of users in the four short years it has been in business. But as users have multiplied, creating their own web pages on the site, rare but troubling incidents have increased, too. Sexual assailants have monitored MySpace Web sites to prey upon minors who ill-advisedly post highly personal information about themselves.\n        That's one reason the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, led a coalition of attorneys general from several states to demand that MySpace do more to make its site safer for children. The group persuaded the company to remove the Web pages of 7,000 known sexual predators. My Space.com also says it supports state and federal legislation to force sexual offenders to register their e-mail addresses with law enforcement authorities, or risk up to five years in prison.\n        Now Mr. Blumenthal and others want MySpace to check the age of people who use the site, including children, and raise the minimum age for registered users to 16 from the current 14.\n        Mr. Blumenthal has done the company a favor by his insistence that more safeguards be put in place. But it is not clear that children's ages can be verified without violating the privacy of school records or Social Security numbers, especially since minors rarely have widely-accepted identification.\n        Yet another possibility, Mr. Blumenthal suggests, is to require parental consent for children to register their profiles on the site. But critics say predators could simply create fake Internet identities as minors and use their real names to submit the needed ''parental'' consent, thus making it even easier for them to lure children into social interactions. Restrictive laws could also wind up causing unnecessary regulation of popular Web pages used by bloggers, or sites where people play video games together. A law written with the best of intentions could wind up casting a too-wide net. And there is nothing to prevent Web site companies from moving offshore and out of the reach of American law.\n        This is a complicated issue that requires energy from lawmakers, Internet companies and attorneys general. There will not be just one solution to the problem, but several, and none will be foolproof.\n        One step in the right direction might be for social networking sites to require users under 18 to take an Internet safety course before they are allowed to create Web pages. It seems obvious, but when teenagers post explicit photos and suggestive information about themselves, they not only invite unwanted attention from criminals but they also diminish their chances of obtaining jobs in the future.\n        Parents should also become familiar with Web sites their children are using; software that will monitor what their children are doing is readily available.\n        These Web sites are popular because they are fun, enabling kids to socialize with the click of a few buttons.

The proposed new space vehicles look like a sensible way to put astronauts and cargo into space after the shuttle fleet is retired and will be built to facilitate landings on both the Moon and Mars. Michael Griffin, the new administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, deserves credit for putting real flesh on what had been little more than an aspiration. Unfortunately, the new plan lacks the pizzazz to inspire public support and will be operating under budget constraints that make delays or overruns likely.\n        The new crew exploration vehicle will be built around well-known space technologies, with booster rockets and engines derived from the shuttle program and a crew capsule like the one used in the lunar program, only bigger. That has the great advantage of letting NASA use much of its current shuttle work force on the new program and the great disadvantage of making the technology look retrograde. This approach will not excite those looking for cutting-edge hardware, but it seems reasonable at a time when reliability is the main goal.\n        The configuration largely eliminates the two hazards that destroyed the Columbia and the Challenger. NASA calculates that the new vehicle should be 10 times safer than the shuttle, with perhaps a 1 in 2,000 chance of a catastrophe.\n        The plan pays only the barest lip service to international cooperation; Europe, Japan, China and India all have lunar programs of one kind or another under way. Mr. Griffin said NASA hoped to send Americans back to the Moon by 2018 under its own program but was open to partnerships on what to do or build on the lunar surface. Given that most experts say international collaboration will be imperative on a high-cost mission to Mars, it seems desirable to enlist international partners very early.\n        It is hard to see how NASA can complete all the tasks on its agenda while operating on a constrained budget, which is scheduled to grow at only the rate of inflation. The agency needs to repair the damage to its facilities from Katrina, fly the shuttle safely until 2010, complete the space station by that date, fly the new crew exploration vehicle by 2012 and return to the Moon by 2018 or 2020, all the while carrying out its science, aeronautics and robotics programs. The safety valve is that NASA will carry out the exploration program on a ''go as you can afford to pay'' basis, without raiding money from other space programs. That means that cost overruns may stretch out the completion dates, and leave the exploration vision a more distant prospect.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1761532,"ids":1761532,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Nassau County's executive, Tom Suozzi, has found a place in Garden City to put housing that people of modest means can buy. It's a little out of the way. Reporters invited to the news conference were told to follow the road ringing Roosevelt Field mall to the edge of a distant office building parking lot: ''You will see a dumpster or two along the wooded area (on the curb) on the left hand side,'' the e-mail said. ''Keep going past that and the little dirt path after those dumpsters, behind that office building.''\n        The nearly 12-acre site is home to towering weeds, chunks of concrete, a car battery, beer cans, poison ivy and ailanthus trees. On a recent morning, a yellow warbler flitted out of the shadows, past a bushwhacking squirrel. The site is owned by the county and zoned for commercial use, but at the moment it appears to be zoned for a dump.\n        But it's in Garden City! And that's the important thing.\n        Many people in gentle Garden City resist working-class housing. A plan two years ago to build affordable units in a former county building in the village was fought so bitterly that Mr. Suozzi, who has made a career of picking fights with institutions more powerful than he, bowed meekly to the prevailing winds. Nassau County needs affordable housing, he once told a Garden City crowd, ''but Garden City is not the location.''\n        Such exceptionalism seems to be the norm for Garden City. It is tidy, safe, and has fine schools and parks and huge houses. It cherishes its coziness, but has not always been averse to new development -- luxury homes and condominiums have been built there with little fuss. But Mr. Suozzi is not focusing on luxury housing on the weedy lot near the Stewart School. Without offering specifics, he says he wants it to include at least some ''next-generation housing,'' which in Nassau is a euphemism for government-subsidized housing that working-class people can afford.\n        Such housing is a good idea anywhere in Nassau County, not only because so many young people and families on Long Island desperately need it, but also because -- depending on where it goes -- it can help end longstanding patterns of racial and economic separation on Long Island, one of the most segregated suburbs in the country. Long Island's shameful apparatus of redlining and racial steering should have been dismantled generations ago. There may be no finer place than Garden City, which is 94 percent white, to begin that process.\n        Mr. Suozzi, while not exactly leading that charge, has at least slipped the ball into Garden City's court. He has found a site that is technically within the village, but one that hardly any villagers will have to look at. It is hard to imagine what credible objections Garden City might raise. The mayor, Gerard Lundquist, and other village officials have been silent so far on the Suozzi plan. They say they want to wait until a meeting with him on May 26.\n        We can hope that they will embrace this proposal as an opportunity to prove that Garden Citizens are not only happy to let people of moderate means into the village to shop, cook, babysit, repair, mow, teach, serve and protect -- but are also generous enough to let them live there, too.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1788897,"ids":1788897,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Nearly 18 percent of New Jersey workers leave their homes before 6:30 a.m. every day, according to Census Bureau figures. While the state no doubt is home to many high-achieving go-getters, not all of those early risers are Type A personalities. Many of them simply cannot afford to live near their offices and workplaces. So their commutes, whether by car, train or bus, begin early and end late.\n        Thanks to state and federal subsidies, there are pockets of affordable housing throughout the state. But they are shrinking. The state must act quickly and creatively to prevent more New Jerseyans from being priced out of the real estate market.\n        Gov. Jon Corzine recently unveiled a plan to construct 100,000 affordable homes and apartments over the next 10 years using a mixture of low-cost mortgages, tax incentives and housing vouchers. This ambitious agenda, modeled on a program implemented by Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration in New York City, is as crucial to New Jersey's future as the political reforms under discussion in Trenton.\n        The governor's proposal comes at a critical time. The state may soon lose thousands of previously affordable housing units, thanks to the expiration of agreements between the public and private sectors.\n        Thirty years ago, developers accepted government subsidies for housing construction. In return, they agreed to keep prices affordable. But those agreements are beginning to expire. A housing advocacy group, the National Housing Trust, estimates that price limits on about 24,000 housing units will expire over the next five years. Owners will then be free to sell or rent the units for market rates.\n        Many state and municipal governments are confronted with similar scenarios, 30 years removed from a subsidized building boom. But New Jersey's problem is particularly acute, given the high -- and ever-escalating -- cost of real estate, particularly in the state's most populated regions.\n        Fortunately, some of the affected units were built by not-for-profit organizations that have expressed no interest in walking away from a commitment to affordable housing. Still, there is a genuine danger of losing a large stock of moderate-priced housing.\n        State Senator Ronald Rice of Essex County recently introduced a bill that would prevent housing units built with state subsidies from slipping out of government price regulations. But the state cannot simply rewrite the terms of an agreement it made with developers years ago. Mr. Corzine's blueprint, which won praise from affordable housing advocates, is a much more realistic and more equitable solution.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1712751,"ids":1712751,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Nearly 30 years ago, in the waning days of the Ford administration, a compendium of tax-reform proposals entitled ''Blueprints for Basic Tax Reform'' was pronounced dead on arrival in government offices throughout Washington. A decade later, many of the ideas bore fruit in the vast and generally constructive Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n        The final report of President Bush's tax reform panel, due Tuesday, may have a similar fate. Popular discontent with advance word on its recommendations is sure to spook Congress into inaction in the coming election year, especially on proposals to limit the mortgage-interest deduction, abolish the deduction for state and local taxes, and reduce the write-off for employer-provided health insurance.\n        Tackling a job as challenging as tax reform in a serious and fair way requires exceptional leadership. Even if Mr. Bush has the desire and ability to take on such a task, there is the danger that the midterm elections will leave him too much of a lame duck to do it. Bipartisanship is also essential to rewriting the tax code, and that is hardly this president's strong suit. Mr. Bush is not even likely to have the support of his own right wing, which wants a less progressive tax code than the panel envisions.\n        That's fine with us. The panel's expected report deserves the death sentence that awaits it -- but not because it's entirely unworthy. The panel appears to have done an admirable job of addressing many difficult issues in a competent way. Even the limits on popular deductions, which have inspired visions of a dagger pointed at the heart of the middle class, are not as objectionable when combined with other proposed changes that would make up for the loss of valuable write-offs for working Americans.\n        What damns this particular effort are the constraints placed on it from the outset. Mr. Bush directed the panel to assume that the temporary tax cuts passed during his first term -- which mainly benefit the wealthy -- would be made permanent, rather than expiring as scheduled in the next two to four years. The president also told the panel that a reformed tax code should raise the same amount of revenue that would be raised by a tax system in which his tax cuts had been made permanent.\n        Those assumptions build in a huge cut in future revenues that would ensure never-ending deficits and, with them, either tax increases to narrow the gap or sharp reductions in vital government programs like Medicare and Social Security. In fact, the cost of making the tax cuts permanent is three times as large as the long-term shortfall in Social Security.\n        The country needs a better tax system. But the president's insistence on making his tax cuts permanent has undermined his panel's efforts to address long-term needs.\n        The short-term answer, however, is simple: Congress must stop the bleeding from this administration's reckless tax-cutting agenda.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1806599,"ids":1806599,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Nearly every month for the past two and a half years, inflation has eaten up whatever wage gains most American workers have managed to eke out. In August, however, the cost of living started to moderate, thanks largely to falling energy prices. As a result, wages outpaced prices substantially in September. And in October, according to a government report last week, average hourly earnings were 2.8 percent higher than a year earlier, after adjusting for inflation -- the biggest annual increase since 1998.\n        A real increase is something to cheer for a broad swath of working Americans -- non-managers who make up 80 percent of the labor force and whose wages up until now have not reflected their impressive productivity over the past several years. But behind the headline numbers, the wage picture -- and what it says about the economy -- is still cloudy.\n        The gains of September and October were due to declining inflation, not faster wage growth. And with most economists predicting a slower economy through the middle of next year, it's unlikely that American workers will get a sustained pay boost any time soon.\n        In other words, Americans' purchasing power now depends almost entirely on the up and down of energy prices. That's not encouraging for anyone worried about America's dependency on the countries that produce most of the world's oil. It's also not likely to make for a confident consumer in an economy that has long depended on enthusiastic borrowing and shopping to fuel growth. And sure enough, retail sales have been disappointing even as gas prices have declined. An economic analysis released this week by Merrill Lynch shows that fatter paychecks in September fed into just three spending categories: music, clothing and eating out, rather than big-ticket categories like cars or appliances. In October, consumers backed off even more, with most all of the ''extra'' pay going into groceries and pharmacy items.\n        The coming holiday shopping season will be the true test of consumer resiliency. But the modesty of recent purchases -- in the face of the best real wage growth in eight years -- does not bode well.\n        There are early signs that Americans, untypically, may choose to pay down debt in the weeks and months ahead, rather than spend their money. The savings rate, though still negative, has improved of late, while bank lending to households has flattened.\n        Debt reduction would help families clean up their balance sheets, but it risks slowing the economy even further as spending winds down. That may be an inescapable bind. Working Americans, who have yet to participate fully in the Bush-era economic expansion, may not be ready or able to rev up the economy out of its current slow pace.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1759881,"ids":1759881,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"New Jersey drivers apparently do not like the smell of gasoline in the morning. Or at any other time of day or night.\n        Like just about every other elected official in the United States, Gov. Jon Corzine recently felt obliged to produce a plan to save drivers a few pennies on a gallon of gas. In doing so, he took on a New Jersey tradition: The full-service gas station.\n        Mr. Corzine proposed an experiment with self-service for a limited time at gas stations along the New Jersey Turnpike, hoping that it would yield 5-cent savings in the price of a gallon. New Jersey is one of only two states -- the other is Oregon -- that does not allow drivers to pump their own fuel. The ban on self-service dates to the late 1940's and was prompted by safety concerns that now are wildly out of date.\n        Mr. Corzine's proposal was a cautious-enough move on the highly charged political issue of soaring gas prices. It's not as though he wanted to open up the nation's strategic oil reserve, one of Senator Charles Schumer's favored strategies. Nor did he promise to send $100 to New Jersey drivers in exchange for allowing oil companies to drill in the Pinelands.\n        Even so, state legislators and the public reacted as though Mr. Corzine had proposed changing the color of the Margate elephant from pink to yellow.\n        It turns out that many New Jerseyans regard the mandatory full-service gasoline station as an important cultural artifact, a remnant of the days when the state's highways were filled with Pullman-style diners and drive-in movie theaters, and desirable in its own right. Last week, the Assembly speaker, Joseph Roberts, said that lawmakers from both parties had heard nothing good about the proposal from their constituents.\n        Mr. Corzine has now withdrawn the plan. But the public's hostile reaction to an idea that was meant to save them money is worth noting. Perhaps it means that New Jersey drivers are more realistic than others about the cost of gasoline and the inevitability of price spikes in an uncertain world. A more likely explanation is that smart New Jersey drivers are well aware that their state is already a haven for thrifty motorists, even without self service: the state's 14.5-cent tax on a gallon of gas is about half the tax imposed by neighboring states.\n        That's why full-service gas in New Jersey still is cheaper than self-service in New York or Pennsylvania. And that's why you see so many out-of-state plates in gas stations on the west side of the Hudson River and the east side of the Delaware.\n        At least for local motorists, lightly-taxed gasoline and full service make a good combination that few New Jerseyans wanted to disturb.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1773217,"ids":1773217,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"New Jersey is known for its bare-knuckle politics -- veterans will remember the savaging Pete Dawkins, a retired general, a Rhodes Scholar and a Heisman Trophy winner, received at the hands of Frank Lautenberg in the 1988 Senate campaign.

Kean Jr. and U.S. Senator Robert Menendez showed that it is never too early to cast aspersions. Though November's general election is months away, the candidates engaged in the parry and thrust one associates with weapons more dangerous than words.\n        Mr. Kean's attacks were particularly noteworthy -- in part because they seemed out of character for a candidate who generally prefers to talk about ideas rather than personalities, in part because he reached so far back in time to portray Mr. Menendez as a clubhouse politician, dredging up a forgotten corruption case from the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n        At the time, Mr. Menendez was a young official on the Union City school board. His mentor, Union City Mayor William V. Musto, and other officials were indicted on corruption charges; Mr. Menendez gave testimony that helped convict them. Mr. Kean and his campaign asserted that Mr. Menendez testified only to save his own skin, implying that far from being a principled whistleblower he was in fact part of the city's corrupt political machine.\n        But as the Jim Dwyer reported last Sunday's New York Times, federal prosecutors who tried the case disagree with Mr. Kean's assessment. ''It's a sad commentary that Menendez's role in the trial is being used against him,'' said one of the prosecutors, Samuel Rosenthal.\n        Undaunted, Mr. Kean reprised the case during the first debate, asserting again that Mr. Menendez' testimony was anything but an act of courage. Lest voters miss the point, he turned to Mr. Menendez and said, ''Bob, I think you're unethical.''\n        Mr. Menendez reacted as any wounded victim would, then retorted with a cheap shot of his own, attacking his opponent for accepting a $5,000 contribution from a casino operator. Casinos are barred from contributing to state political campaigns, but the Senate race is governed by federal rules that contain no such prohibition.\n        Perhaps these early debates will prove to be the low-water mark of this year's campaign.

But significant redevelopment is unlikely to occur if the current campaign to demonize eminent domain and restrict its uses is allowed to succeed.\n        Joseph Maraziti Jr., a prominent land use lawyer and a driving force behind the effort to steer developers to the cities, argued at a conference in Trenton last month that eminent domain is an essential tool if urban land is to be cleared for redevelopment and that without it a handful of holdout property owners could block almost any redevelopment project. If that were to happen, he suggested, New Jersey's economy would eventually suffocate since the state -- already the most densely populated in the country -- is running out of open land.\n        The New Jersey Legislature is nearing final approval of a measure that would tighten the standards for eminent domain and increase significantly what cities and towns would have to pay unwilling sellers. Approved by the Assembly but stalled in the State Senate, the bill arises in part from the negative reaction to a 2005 United States Supreme Court decision in a Connecticut case that upheld the use of eminent domain for private development, even if the land is not blighted. It also stems, however, from a well-founded reaction against politicians in a few New Jersey towns who have invoked the threat of eminent domain to pressure owners of viable small businesses to sell to favored developers.\n        Redevelopment advocates agree that legislation is needed to stop heavy-handed tactics and to make compensation reflect today's prices. But they also fear that by providing incentives for property owners to hold out for exorbitant prices, the bill would make it difficult, if not prohibitively expensive, for cities to invoke eminent domain.\n        The sponsor, Assemblyman John Burzichelli, a Gloucester Democrat, says this is not his intention and that he only wants to insure that residents and owners are paid fair prices and are given adequate advance notice of plans to take their property, and that only truly blighted areas are condemned.\n        But one section of the bill is especially troublesome. It would base payments to owners on a combination of fair market value and estimates of the income that the redeveloped property would generate. While that approach might have merit in the case of long-term owners and residents, it would be an outrageously high price to pay slumlords, speculators and owners who leave toxic waste on their property.\n        Mr. Burzichelli says there is no way his bill could constitutionally distinguish between good owners and bad owners. But the state's public advocate, Ronald Chen, who supports Mr. Burzichelli's bill, says the flaw can be ''fixed in a minute.

Many factors help to wrap these crimes in silence, especially the immigrants' ignorance and shame, and their fear of arrest and deportation.\n        It is thus cause for considerable cheer that New York State's leaders last week agreed on a long-awaited measure that would crack down on the trafficking of people for sex and labor while offering help to the victims. Any doubts that we badly need such a law were dispelled by a horrifying story of exploitation and cruelty that surfaced last week in Long Island.\n        According to federal prosecutors, a couple in Muttontown, a wealthy enclave near Oyster Bay, kept two Indonesian women in virtual slavery for years, paying them a pittance for long hours of domestic labor punctuated with sickening abuses. The couple, Varsha Mahender Sabhnani and Mahender Murlidhar Sabhnani, who run a multimillion-dollar perfume business from their home, are said to have given the women little food and forced them to sleep on mats on the floor and to hide when visitors came. According to court papers, Mrs. Sabhnani often beat one of the women with a stick and burned her with cigarettes and scalding water.\n        The story came to light early on Mother's Day, when one of the women showed up at a Dunkin' Donuts, bruised and disheveled, wearing only pants and a towel. Employees invited her in and offered her a jacket and coffee, then called 911 after seeing her injuries. The couple have been charged with violating a federal law against slavery.\n        The Sabhnanis are entitled to the presumption of innocence about what their lawyers say is merely ''an assault allegation.'' But the accusations against them should jolt people awake to a wider problem that law enforcement officials and human-rights advocacy groups have been warning about for years. Although there is a federal law against human trafficking for sex and labor, the Justice Department is usually forced to spend its limited resources in breaking up larger operations, like prostitution rings, and not individual cases of exploited nannies or maids.\n        For its part, New York has long needed an aggressive anti-trafficking law that contains tough penalties, helps victims to escape their tormenters and offers an array of social services once they do. A good bill sponsored last year by Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Bronx Democrat, was badly weakened in committee, and the session ended without a chance to improve it and hammer out a final bill with the Senate.\n        The news is better this year. Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Legislature reached a deal last week on an anti-trafficking bill that would turn such forms of modern slavery, particularly prostitution, into felonies and offer victims emergency housing and health care and other services from the state. Their action comes too late for the Indonesian women. But for others who are out among us, suffering mutely, the hope for justice has improved.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1709093,"ids":1709093,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"New York City officials inconvenienced a large number of people over the past week for what appears to have been a false alarm about a terrorist plot against the subways. Fortunately, New Yorkers have a high tolerance for inconvenience. We are put out of our way virtually every day by parades, accidents, movie shoots, demonstrations, traffic jams, track fires and visiting heads of state. If something comes up that makes city officials particularly worried about a potential bombing, they should feel free to go right ahead and disrupt our routines.\n        It's hard to imagine how the Police Department could have responded any differently once it had been told that an informer in the Middle East who had been useful on at least some occasions in the past had reported plans for a large series of attacks that would begin last Friday. The police had to step up security, and being open about it was the only rational course; deploying hundreds of officers on the subways without explanation would have caused endless rumors and alarm. Mayor Michael Bloomberg also did the right thing by holding a news conference and being as forthcoming as he could, even though he had to take flak for the coincidence in timing. (He stayed away from a campaign debate in Harlem on that very evening.)\n        What bothers us is that this alert showed that the antiterrorism operations for this huge and vital city are hardly the seamless affair we were promised after 9\/11. The Homeland Security Department was scoffing about the alert -- on background, of course -- minutes after it was announced. It's been pretty clear that the department was enjoying the behind-the-scenes chance to make a local police force that prides itself on its expertise and independence look amateurish. Meanwhile, a number of big cities have chafed at what some officials claim is a failure of the Homeland Security Department to share information speedily, and some make it clear that they believe the top urban police departments could do a better job of coordinating intelligence on their own.\n        This territorial politics and press spin is not how things should be four years after the 9\/11 attacks. Background sniping confuses the public, dilutes the value of making these security announcements in the first place and leaves people wondering whether all the interlocking parts of the nation's security apparatus are really all that interlocking.

The most damning analysis came from the community group ACORN. It called for sweeping curriculum changes at minority neighborhood middle schools, which typically lack the math, science and critical reading instruction necessary to prepare students for the entry test at the city's flagship high schools -- Stuyvesant, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech.\n        The city should have seized on these findings as an opportunity to build a new middle school infrastructure in underserved neighborhoods. Instead, it opted for a poorly conceived and poorly run tutoring program that has now been exposed as a failure.\n        As a result, the percentage of minority students who pass the entry tests for Stuyvesant, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech high schools has dropped precipitously. Equally distressing is the news that minority enrollment is also dropping at some of the City University's most prestigious campuses.\n        The city claims to have been taken by surprise by the high school data, and the results surely must have been disappointing in view of the fact that Mayor Michael Bloomberg has chosen to make education his signature issue.\n        The high school data have raised questions about Mr. Bloomberg's school reforms. Some critics now argue, for example, that he has focused too heavily on basic math and reading tests scores in the primary grades and has neglected to take the steps needed to encourage high-performing minority students in the upper grades.\n        Mr. Bloomberg and his educational team face many challenges, but among the most pressing is the need to renovate the notoriously terrible middle schools in poor neighborhoods. For starters, the city should find out where the elite high school students received their middle school education -- and then emulate those programs in minority neighborhoods. The data will likely show that most of the public school students who enter places like Stuyvesant hail from just a few districts.\n        The idea that students with decent preparation in the lower grades will automatically thrive is faulty. The city needs to attack the weaknesses of middle schools with the same urgency it has directed toward the elementary schools. New York needs a kind of Marshall Plan for its middle schools, especially in minority areas, with the specific aim of producing more high-performing minority students.\n        Getting there won't be easy.

The college seems perfectly willing to tolerate that group, as well as clubs for devotees of ballroom dancing, chamber music, a capella singing and other extracurricular endeavors. What the school cannot stomach, to its great discredit, is a group called Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People in Medicine.\n        It is a shame that any institution of higher learning would ban a student club over issues of sexual identity, even a school like New York Medical College, which has direct connections to the Roman Catholic Church, whose doctrinal positions on homosexuality are neither in the cultural mainstream nor open to debate.\n        The college is run by a corporation whose members are appointed by New York's archbishop, and declares itself to be ''in the Catholic tradition.'' That, so far at least, has been its justification for banning the gay student club, whose activities it says are ''inconsistent with the values'' of the college.\n        The college's ban has caused a stir in Westchester, with consequences that are regrettable and so far thoroughly predictable. Cries for inclusion and tolerance from aggrieved supporters of the gay group and its president, Joshua Sahara, have had no success; the school is private and not subject to such coercion from outsiders.\n        On an official level, the county executive, Andrew J. Spano, has issued scolding news releases and vowed that the county would not work with the college on future projects. But that is about as far as it goes. The county's Human Rights Commission has concluded that the school's private status exempts it from county antidiscrimination law.\n        It seems clear that further pressure -- assailing the decision as shortsighted and counterproductive, say, or warning that the school will become an academic pariah, an outlier even among its Catholic peers -- is likely to fail in the short run. Critics of the college have repeatedly pointed out that other Catholic institutions, like Iona College and Fordham University, have found it possible to accept gay student groups without fearing the compromise of their religious identities.\n        The most disheartening fact in this sorry situation is that the banned club at New York Medical College operated under a different name -- the Student Support Group -- without problems for several years. Only after it took on the more explicit name chosen by Mr. Sahara last fall did it lose its financing and meeting space, suggesting that college officials were moved more by semantics and their own queasy feelings and emotions rather than by simple decency and good sense.\n        William O. Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, has suggested to The Journal News, unhelpfully, that those who do not like the school are free to go somewhere else. Perhaps there is a better solution -- through the good-natured evocation of the sort of tolerance and compassion espoused by Christ in the New Testament. We suggest that Mr. Sahara form a club called Pharisees, Tax Collectors, Prostitutes and Sinning People in Medicine, with membership open to all, if only to see how the good people of New York Medical College could possibly object.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1716687,"ids":1716687,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"New York State announced Wednesday that it would adopt California's strict new limits on automobile emissions of carbon dioxide, a major global warming gas. The announcement fulfills Gov. George Pataki's pledge in his State of the State address in 2003 to make all cars sold in New York State adhere to the California standards. It also puts him on a direct collision course with the Bush administration, which has joined with the major automobile manufacturers in opposing the California program.\n        The California program, approved by the State Legislature in 2002, requires manufacturers to begin cutting carbon dioxide emissions in the 2009 model year, with a goal of reducing these emissions by 30 percent by the 2016 model year. This is an ambitious target, and absent a sudden technological breakthrough, the only feasible way to meet it is to force the automakers to produce more fuel-efficient cars, which produce less emissions.\n        The program faces a legal siege. The automakers and the administration argue that this is merely a backdoor way of mandating tougher fuel-economy standards, which under current law are the responsibility of the federal government. California's reply is that it has a right -- indeed, an obligation -- under the Clean Air Act to remove pollutants of any kind from California's air.\n        The larger issue here is one of political leadership. President Bush has refused to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from any source -- cars, power plants or industrial sites -- preferring instead a softer, voluntary approach that has yielded little progress. Congress, meanwhile, has refused to mandate significant increases in fuel efficiency.\n        Impatient governors who take global warming more seriously than Mr. Bush and Congress do -- including Republicans like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mr. Pataki -- have therefore decided to take matters into their own hands.\n        Altogether, more than 30 states have approved global warming laws of one sort or another. And in a few weeks, a consortium of Northeastern states will announce a breakthrough program imposing regional caps on power plants' emissions and setting up a trading program to help cut these emissions in a cost-effective manner.\n        The impact of the automobile program could be huge if it survives legal challenges. Cars and light trucks (a category that includes sport utility vehicles) account for one-fifth of America's greenhouse gas emissions and about 40 percent of its oil consumption. In addition to New York, seven Northeastern states as well as Washington and Oregon have either adopted the California program or are moving in that direction.\n        This means that by the end of the year, nearly one-third of the automobile retail market is likely to be covered by the new regulations -- a tremendous incentive to the industry to start making fuel-efficient cars for everyone.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1850319,"ids":1850319,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"New York State government has two parts, one public and one carefully tucked out of sight.\n        The public part includes the Legislature and the governor, who enact laws and hold news conferences.

The Legislature appears poised to do one important thing right: to require that touch-screen voting machines produce voter-verifiable paper records. But it is in danger of doing another important thing wrong: giving short shrift to optical-scan voting, the most reliable and cost-effective of the current technologies. As it finalizes voting machine legislation, Albany should ignore lobbyists for high-priced voting machines and come out strongly for optical-scan machines.\n        The big voting machine companies, which are well connected politically, are aggressively pushing touch-screen voting. These A.T.M.-style machines make a lot of sense for the manufacturers because they are expensive and need to be replaced frequently. But touch-screen machines are highly vulnerable to being hacked or maliciously programmed to change votes. And they cost far more than voting machines should. If touch-screen machines are going to be used -- and they have spread rapidly in recent years -- it is vital that they produce voter-verifiable paper records of every vote to ensure that their results are accurate.\n        The better course would be not to use them at all. The best voting technology now available uses optical scanning. These machines work like a standardized test. Voters mark their choices on a paper form, which is then counted by a computer. The paper ballots are kept, becoming the official record of the election. They can be recounted, and if there is a discrepancy between them and the machine count, the paper ballots are the final word.\n        Optical-scan machines produce a better paper record than touch-screen machines because it is one the voter has actually filled out, not a receipt that the voter must check for accuracy. Optical-scan machines are also far cheaper than touch-screens. Their relatively low cost will be welcomed by taxpayers, of course, but it also has a direct impact on elections. Because touch-screen machines are so expensive, localities are likely to buy too few, leading to long lines at the polls.\n        The draft bills that the Legislature is working on do not rule out optical-scan voting, but they are far more focused on touch-screen voting. That may be because voting machine manufacturers have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying legislators, or it may simply be that optical-scan equipment has had a lower profile. Whatever the reason, the Legislature owes it to the voters -- and the taxpayers -- to promote optical-scan voting.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1822111,"ids":1822111,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"New York lawmakers and the State Board of Regents are rightly nervous about the school reforms recently announced by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The third package of reforms to hit the nation's largest school system in five years, this one radically alters funding formulas and guts the existing management structure -- roiling a system already struggling to digest earlier changes.\n        The Regents and State Legislature have been fretting about the cold shoulder the city has shown to parents and communities since soon after legislators gave Mr. Bloomberg full control of the public schools. That's when the city did away with the longstanding system of 32 community school districts and combined them into 10 regions.\n        It may have saved money, but it also put more distance between the school system and families. Schools Chancellor Joel Klein has promised to rectify those problems. But the new reform, which sweeps away the 10 regions altogether, runs the risk of making the situation worse.\n        This page has long supported turning principals into school managers and holding them accountable for how staffs and students perform. But the young, inexperienced principals who have flooded the New York schools require guidance and support. Sweeping away the remains of the regional system might make it harder for them to get the help they need.\n        Urban school systems have a long and shameful history of dumping the least-qualified teachers into underfinanced schools that serve the poorest children. Mr. Bloomberg's proposal would drive more money to the neediest schools, but there are serious questions about whether it will be sufficient.\n        At the same time, an analysis by a nonpartisan group, the Educational Priorities Panel, takes issue with a related scheme for changing the school personnel budgeting process. Currently, schools are held harmless for teacher salaries. The new system would eventually chalk up teacher salaries against a school's budget. The panel believes that would penalize schools with the highest-paid, most-experienced teachers, driving principals to hire less-experienced teachers. The new formula would also be subject to tampering by politicians.\n        The Bloomberg plan expresses some noble ideals. But reforms that affect the lives of more than a million schoolchildren should not be made in haste or on the basis of consultants' hunches. Given the mayor's habit of ignoring reasonable criticism, the City Council, the Legislature and the Regents should use what leverage they have to ensure that the reforms are closely scrutinized and modified where necessary to produce the best possible result.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1645960,"ids":1645960,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"New York started a disastrous national trend when it passed the draconian Rockefeller drug laws 32 years ago. These laws erased the common-sense distinction between petty drug users and kingpins, sending even first-time offenders to jail for periods of 15 years to life. The laws drove up the inmate population markedly, committed the state to spend billions to build and run new prisons, and did nothing to curb the drug trade.\n        Prosecutors who rightly viewed the laws as impractical and unfair began to get around them by never bringing novice offenders to trial at all, instead diverting them to drug treatment and other rehabilitation programs. The Pataki administration has also developed forward-looking programs in prisons and has begun to stress post-prison strategies that help people who get out of jail to actually stay out.\n        Gov. George E. Pataki took credit for this shift in his State of the State address earlier this month. He told listeners that the prison population had dropped by about 8,000 people, or 11 percent of the total, over the last five years.\n        But county officials and prison rights advocates noted a glaring discrepancy between the governor's sentiments and the actual behavior of the Pataki-controlled State Commission of Correction.\n        Founded in the late 19th century to promote humane treatment at state prisons, the commission has historically concerned itself with training and administrative issues. But recently it has been pressing counties around the state to build new local jails. A recent study released by a watchdog group, the New York State Network for Jail Alternatives and Safer Communities, asserts that since 1995, 36 of New York's counties have built, are constructing or are considering new jails -- thanks partly to pressure from the state.\n        This has made several counties unhappy. They do not believe they should be asked to build new jails when the prison population is declining. On Long Island, Suffolk County has recently sued the commission, accusing it of arbitrary and capricious enforcement of state law in a dispute over jail expansion. Tompkins County refused to expand its jail in a manner suggested by the state, and other counties are poised to follow suit.\n        The counties argue further that they should not be spending millions of dollars on jails at a time when the country as a whole is moving away from mass incarceration and toward rehabilitation, job training and other forms of nonjail approaches. Their complaints make sense; local jail populations are often made up mainly of mentally ill persons and other low-level offenders who would not be in jail at all if they could afford bail. Some critics of the building plan fear that the state is preparing to shift responsibility for incarceration to the local level.\n        Finally, the counties argue that state officials who got into the prison business in the post-Rockefeller years may be assuming that jail and prison populations can only go up, when in fact, as Mr. Pataki himself noted, they can go down as well.\n        The state should take these criticisms seriously. It should also make sure that it is not pressing the counties to build massive new jails that local sheriffs will then feel compelled to keep full.\n        Mr. Pataki should use his influence to straighten out this dispute. He should also make sure that the counties understand and have access to the methods that have successfully reduced the state prison population.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1821780,"ids":1821780,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"New York's Legislature is expected to choose a replacement soon for Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who resigned after pleading guilty last year to a felony. To inject some quality control into a process that could have been all political horse-trading, legislative leaders and Gov. Eliot Spitzer set up an excellent vetting process. Three former comptrollers -- two Democrats and a Republican -- screened candidates and were asked to pick up to five finalists.\n        This week, the former comptrollers narrowed a field of 18 to three finalists: Howard Weitzman, comptroller of Nassau County; Martha Stark, tax commissioner for New York City; and William Mulrow, a businessman and friend of Mr. Spitzer's.\n        The Legislature's job now is to choose one of these three. Assembly Leader Sheldon Silver and some fellow Democrats are threatening to overturn the entire process, mainly because none of the Assembly members who applied made the cut. Their disappointment is understandable. But it cannot be allowed to carry the day.\n        The comptroller is responsible for ensuring the integrity of government, and with managing a $150 billion state pension. It is far too important a post to be given out based on friendship or group loyalty.\n        Of the three recommendations, Mr. Weitzman is clearly the best fit. As Nassau's comptroller, and a partner in a top-four accounting firm before that, he has the strongest background, and he has shown in his current job that he can be steadfastly independent. Ms. Stark is also impressive, although her credentials are not as close a match.

Ms. Stark would also add diversity to the top levels of state government.\n        Mr. Mulrow, a businessman who has run for this office before, has a great deal of knowledge about investments and experience as a manager. But his closeness to Mr. Spitzer and his connections to a bidder for the state's lucrative racetrack business make him the least suitable.\n        With reform starting to take hold, at long last, in Albany, it would be a disturbing slide backward if members of the Legislature abandoned the process in order to pick one of their own.

The State Senate, dominated by Republicans, has failed to beef up the attorney general's enforcement budget, and the Assembly, controlled by Democrats, has rebuffed the Senate's ideas for Medicaid oversight.\n        What all state officials share is the ability to cower like Harry Potter's Dobby before the lobbyists from health unions, nursing homes, hospitals and big pharmaceutical companies. It's time for them to stop catering to this powerful shadow government. New York was once in the forefront in investigating Medicaid fraud, with charges against ''Medicaid mills'' a routine item on the docket. Now the state spends the most money but ranks way down the list for the number of on-site audits or cases referred for prosecution.\n        Every dollar stolen from Medicaid is a dollar taken from a single mother with a feverish child or an elderly person who needs a steady doctor. This is a scandal and a disgrace for the government of New York State and those who run it.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1823693,"ids":"1823693,1823782","split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"New York's State Capitol is like a beehive, a beehive that has just been given a few hearty kicks by Gov. Eliot Spitzer. In almost every quarter, legislators or lobbyists are buzzing about the budget, about ethics reforms, about the election of a new comptroller. Some are so angry that they are threatening to use all the nasty little political weapons at their disposal to bring the energetic new governor down to their level.\n        Mr. Spitzer's promise to cut Medicaid costs and consolidate state hospitals has sent the powerful 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East union and hospital lobbyists into a high-intensity flap. The union is opposing Mr. Spitzer's candidate for State Senate in Nassau County, using taped telephone messages -- purportedly from a local nurse -- warning of future problems for ''local hospitals'' if Mr. Spitzer's candidate wins.\n        Meanwhile, Mr. Spitzer's fellow Democrats in the Assembly have been fuming about the governor's ''meddling'' in the Legislature's choice of a new state comptroller. Furious that not a single Assembly Democrat was a finalist for the job, they vented their displeasure at a closed-door meeting Tuesday and are said to be seeking revenge. This in turn has led to rumors that the ethics package that Mr. Spitzer and legislative leaders agreed on last month has moved off the fast track. If the aim is to have more public input, that's fine. If the idea is to nibble these reforms into oblivion, it's not fine.\n        The other big power center in Albany -- the State Senate Republicans -- is also in a state of controlled panic about Mr. Spitzer's proposals for education financing. For years, Long Island Republicans have made it clear that one untouchable is the Rube Goldberg formula for parceling out state funds for schools. Mr. Spitzer proposes not merely to adjust the formula, but to shred it. In return, he promises to cut property taxes for the middle class, a vital concern for most residents outside the cities.\n        To top it all off, the governor wants to separate judicial pay from legislators' pay. This upsets a lot of legislators because lawmakers have traditionally used judicial pay raises as a way to get increases for themselves. But making sure that judicial pay is not held hostage to legislative pay is clearly the right thing to do. So is revamping the education formulas, and reducing the property tax burden for the middle class. Modernizing the health care system also makes sense, as does selecting an expert comptroller who is more than a politician.\n        All this positive energy has left lawmakers wandering around the State Capitol looking like people who had just lost their identity cards. Yet it makes no sense for them to plot revenge on a governor with a national reputation and with local popularity that continues to soar. Instead, they should rally to Mr. Spitzer's cause and clean up their houses together.\n        We also have some advice for Mr. Spitzer and how he might court this hive of politicians. He should not, of course, cave on the important changes in government he has proposed, and he should continue to use the bully pulpit to whip them into line. But that's the cudgel. As a carrot, he should be careful to give credit where credit is due -- and sometimes even where it is not quite deserved. Credit is a very big deal in Albany, almost as big as campaign donations. Which, by the way, is something else that needs an overhaul.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":18,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1788800,"ids":"1788800,1788866","split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"New York's State Senate is planning a quick session in Albany on Friday, with an agenda that involves tidying up a few loose ends.

But even within that disturbing universe, some areas are worse than others. Take the ''housekeeping'' accounts for state political parties, a gaping loophole that allows donors to give unlimited amounts of money for party housekeeping. You want to write a $500,000 check to the state Democratic Party? Write away. Mayor Michael Bloomberg sent a $705,750 donation to the state Republicans in 2001 before he was elected mayor.\n        The money is supposed to go for party building. But despite laws forbidding use of the money for ''promoting the candidacy of specific candidates,'' most donors know their housekeeping dollars are not going for floor wax.\n        When challenged on the housekeeping scam, New York's politicians routinely spew the same excuse: This money is used by the parties to register and reach voters, they protest. Not so, Common Cause\/N.Y. reported earlier this month. Of the $53 million donated to party housekeeping accounts since 1999, only about $45,000 has been spent for voter registration and outreach. Great chunks went for mailings, polls and advertising, especially during election years.\n        Donors to the housekeeping accounts are the big league political givers in state campaigns. Besides Mr. Bloomberg, other contributors include the hospital lobby; 1199\/S.E.I.U., the health care workers union; teachers; correctional officers and police unions; the pharmaceutical industry; and the National Rifle Association.\n        Invitations to fund-raisers often include a reminder of soft money's limitless possibilities. From his first days in office, Gov. George Pataki reminded individuals, PAC's and corporations that there were no limits on gifts to the party as long as the word ''housekeeping account'' was written on the memo part of the check.\n        Of the two major parties, the Democrats are the least forthcoming about where the money goes -- a lot of items are simply listed as ''other'' expenses, which seem to spike every election year.\n        The Republican Party is more dutiful about filling out the forms. For example, in 2002, the Pataki campaign paid $3.5 million for radio ads developed by a California firm. The party, meanwhile, shelled out another $150,000 in ordinary campaign contributions for television ads made by the same outfit. The party also paid the same company $375,000 in housekeeping money for ''issue ads.''\n        Was all this coordinated to help Mr. Pataki? How could one think such a thing?\n        Rest assured that this is still going on, and that all those businesses and unions giving housekeeping money are not in it for the civic joy of getting out the vote. They want tax breaks, pension bonuses, and all the things that taxpayer money can buy in return for a small down payment in the name of party housekeeping.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1654869,"ids":1654869,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"New York's ethics law has a very large escape clause for state employees. If a state worker gets in trouble with the New York State Ethics Commission, the commission's investigation ends the moment the employee leaves the state payroll. This extraordinary grant of immunity is Albany's version of racing the cops to the county line.\n        The escape clause does not apply if the employee has committed a crime like larceny or bribery. In that case, the employee can expect to face the judge like everyone else.\n        But suppose the worker has done something that is merely sleazy: unethical but not quite a full-fledged criminal act. According to Karl Sleight, executive director of the Ethics Commission, the typical case involves an employee who is using an official position for personal benefit.. Because of the escape clause, absolution is only a resignation away.\n        Ethics Commission officials say that in the last decade they have been unable to pursue about 50 such cases involving suspected violations of state ethics law because the employees have suddenly -- very suddenly -- left their state jobs. Had the employees been found guilty of committing an ethics violation, they could have faced fines of up to $10,000, removal from their jobs and, of course, considerable public embarrassment.\n        Last month, an article by Michael Slackman of The Times described several cases in which state employees suspected of ethics violations simply walked away from their jobs. In one case, two employees of the Long Island Rail Road retired rather than face ethics complaints that they accepted free meals and free tickets to the Viennese Opera Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria.\n        In another case, an investigation by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Jill Konviser-Levine, the state's inspector general, found favoritism and ethical lapses among people involved in a state proposal to sell development rights to land along the Erie Canal for $30,000. The suspects could not be pursued because they had already moved off the state payroll.\n        The main focus of The Times's story was a case involving Dr. Karen R. Hitchcock, who resigned unexpectedly last year as president of the State University of New York at Albany. Dr. Hitchcock said she was leaving to deal with family matters. She was also facing an inquiry into charges that she had contacted a developer to arrange a housing contract in return for the developer's endowing a chair that Dr. Hitchcock would fill once she left the presidency. Dr. Hitchcock, who is now principal of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, says there is ''no substance'' to the ethics complaints.\n        Everyone in Albany professes to favor closing the loophole. But a bill proposed by Mr. Pataki in 1996 that would allow ethics commissioners to pursue former employees has languished. It is time for the assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, to let this bill go to the floor. When it passes, Mr. Pataki can add his signature. For Albany politicians in need of a reform notch on their belts, this one should be easy.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1740534,"ids":1740534,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"New York's state government has been a standing joke for ages, but last year legislators and Gov. George Pataki made a good start at airing out their secret club. That first step will look pretty feeble, though, if they sit back now and pat their bellies in satisfaction. New York deserves a government people can look up to -- not laugh at. This is how to keep moving in the right direction:\n        At the top of the list for this election year is getting candidates for governor and the Legislature to promise publicly that they will reform the way New York creates voting districts. Right now a legislator can draw his own district to fit like a plaster cast. This is the most politically charged issue imaginable, and to get reform the next governor would have to create an independent redistricting commission far in advance of the next redistricting, in 2011 or 2012. Next year would be a good time.\n        Overhauling New York's shameful campaign finance system is also crucial. Connecticut, reeling from its rash of political scandals, has created a gold-standard system, but most advocates of reform in New York see little appetite in Albany for turning off the spigot of easy money from special interests. The initiative will probably have to come from the governor. Before he starts running for president, Mr. Pataki should finally put some muscle behind his dusty old promise to reform the campaign finance system in his home state.\n        A decent series of reforms should include lower contribution limits and at least a modest public financing program. It's also time to tighten the laws on how campaign funds are used. In Albany, politicians have been known to use donations to pay for a pool cover, a plane ticket to send an aide to Italy, a fleet of cars and food for the office pet.\n        The state's lobbying commission should set a limit of $75 per year on gifts from a lobbyist to a legislator, but legislators would do better to ban all but token gifts altogether. Perhaps the most sweeping and useful way to transform business as usual would be to prohibit fund-raisers during the session, as proposed by Assemblyman Alexander Grannis of New York City. Right now legislators in Albany routinely spend their days passing bills and their nights collecting checks. Sometimes the whole place has the feel of Dodge City.\n        There are other ways New York can help erase its reputation as a failed state government. Budget reform is still a necessity. Comptroller Alan Hevesi has come up with promising proposals for more transparency. And citizen activists have devised an impressive 70-page reform bill that would create such improvements as an independent state ethics commission, like those in 39 other states. There's plenty to do. This will be the year that determines whether Albany is really on the upturn, or just recovering from an uncharacteristic spate of reforms.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1768329,"ids":1768329,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Next December, in the final month of Gov. George Pataki's administration, a commission made up mostly of his appointees is set to make its recommendation on how to address the financial crisis facing the state's health care facilities. Mr. Pataki won't be around to implement their recommendations, but we hope the next governor, and the state legislature, take them very seriously.\n        Among other recommendations, the commission is supposed to come up with a list of hospitals and nursing homes that are superfluous and should be closed -- something like the list of targeted military bases prepared for Congress.\n        But it has already done important work in prodding troubled facilities to make changes on their own. Several hospitals that have reason to believe they might be endangered are preemptively taking the scalpel to their own budgets, or finding new purposes for underutilized wards.\n        The fact that facilities are making changes on their own rather than taking a chance on what the commission is euphemistically calling ''right-sizing'' is a useful beginning. The commission should get credit for helping them face reality, as well as for taking on a chore that has been anathema to politicians who feared repercussions from health care workers and community advocates.\n        Closing hospitals and cutting services is unpleasant work. But it's impossible to duck the fact that New York's health care costs appear to be spinning out of control. Long term care is the most expensive in the nation, thanks to generous Medicaid coverage and fraud that has mostly gone uncurbed. Hospital costs are driven up by huge numbers of uninsured -- 1.3 million in the state in 2005, about a third of that number in the city.\n        These people, usually lacking even an ounce of preventive care, arrive needing pounds of cure. Treating uninsured patients in public hospitals costs hundreds of millions of dollars a year in New York City alone. Mayor Michael Bloomberg's new budget would reduce the looming deficit for city-owned hospitals, but clearly a more fundamental solution is called for.\n        Some of the biggest problems, like the uninsured, won't be solved by closing down facilities. But the commission, headed by the former Port Authority chief Stephen Berger, believes that one of the main causes of financial difficulties is that there are too many hospital beds because many patients use walk-in clinics or require only brief hospital stays. The commission says there may be as many as 20,000 excess beds around the state. Opponents say that number is grossly overstated. It's important that the final report makes its case thoroughly.\n        Any hospital closing is painful to the community involved, and particularly to the staff that works there, and it's far from certain that closings will do as much to curb costs as the commission hopes. But the issue needs to be addressed. It makes no sense at a time of budgetary contraints -- or at any time, for that matter -- to be saddled with an inefficient allocation of health care dollars. Moreover, the state, battered by charges about its inability to combat Medicaid fraud, does not have a lot of credibility on cost issues to being with.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1671628,"ids":1671628,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Next month Rotary International turns 100. Rotary clubs, a staple of small-town life, are celebrating the construction of innumerable parks, the holding of myriad blood drives, the awarding of countless college scholarships -- and the imminent global eradication of polio.\n        Twenty years ago, there were a thousand new cases of polio every day. Now polio strikes only about a thousand children a year. By next year, that number should be zero. People who think of Rotary as a congregation of service-minded dentists and funeral directors may not have noticed, but the dentists and funeral directors have created the largest, most successful private health initiative ever.\n        When Rotary celebrated its 75th birthday, its leaders decided to find a project that all its clubs -- now in 168 countries -- could work on together. A Rotarian ophthalmologist in the Philippines, where polio was rampant, asked Rotary to vaccinate Filipino children. It vaccinated six million, then made similar efforts in five other nations. In 1985, Rotary decided to wipe out polio completely.\n        By the time polio is eradicated, Rotary clubs will have directly contributed at least $600 million, more than any other organization except the United States government. And they offer more than cash.\n        ''We realized the task of getting vaccines to children, persuading mothers and fathers of the value of immunization, was a problem of distribution, logistics and social mobilization,'' said Herb Pigman, an American who was one of the campaign's early leaders. ''And here's an organization with boots on the ground in hundreds of thousands of communities.''\n        Big boots, too. ''Every polio meeting you go to, you see them,'' said Rima Salah, deputy executive director of Unicef. ''They have commitment, credibility and influence with leaders.'' This is crucial, as the challenge today is political. In August 2003, Muslim clerics from the northern Nigerian state of Kano charged that America had laced the polio vaccine with drugs to render African girls infertile. Kano stopped vaccinating. Kano's cases doubled, and Nigerian strains of polio have spread to 16 other nations that had beaten the virus.\n        Coincidentally, the president of Rotary International that year, Jonathan Majiyagbe, was from Kano. He helped broker a compromise: Kano would use vaccine made in Indonesia, a Muslim country. In August 2004, Kano's governor publicly vaccinated his infant daughter.\n        Although the countries Kano infected will have to spend millions on emergency vaccination campaigns, they will probably be successful. The real challenge is to eliminate polio at its epicenter, Nigeria. If Kano does not bolt again, this will probably happen in a year. ''We would not be here without Rotary International,'' Dr. Salah said. ''Rotary is the heart and soul of polio eradication.''\n        TINA ROSENBERG","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1678205,"ids":1678205,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Next month could be a historic turning point for the more than 300 million Africans who live on less than a dollar a day.

The leading nations of Europe have pledged long-term financial support. Leading entertainers like Madonna, Bono, Will Smith and Elton John have announced a set of simultaneous concerts to take place in London, Rome, Berlin and Philadelphia to mobilize grass-roots enthusiasm.\n        Only one crucial element is still missing -- the wholehearted support of the United States government. Unless President Bush joins this effort in the five weeks remaining before the summit meeting to be held in July in Scotland, Africa's hopes will be disappointed and America's image in the eyes of a world that once looked to it for enlightened leadership will be further diminished.\n        Mr. Blair will be in Washington this week trying to persuade Mr. Bush to do the right thing.\n        This really should be a no-brainer. At a time when the image of the United States abroad is at rock bottom in many parts of the globe, President Bush could go a long way toward re-establishing the world's richest country as the moral leader it was in the last century. He can do that by supporting his most reliable international ally in this crucial effort and taking to heart the world's poorest and most wretched place.\n        Two weeks ago, the European Union announced that its members would double their aid to poor countries by 2015. The announcement came after France, Britain and Germany -- all members of the G-8 -- had each laid out timetables for meeting the United Nations' target of increasing foreign assistance to poor countries to 0.7 percent of gross national income by 2015. The European announcements further isolated the American government, which gives only 0.18 percent, and has remained mute about getting to 0.7 percent.\n        Africans, after long years of accepting the rule of brutal and corrupt dictators, are finally dragging themselves to their feet to say, ''Enough.'' But there are two paths they can take. With help, African countries can take the route of development and progress, and finally enjoy lives that are about more than just scrounging day in and day out for food in one's stomach and shoes on one's feet. Without that help, those same countries can take the path that cycles back into civil war, poverty and life expectancies so low that 13-year-old girls are considered old women.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1723264,"ids":1723264,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Next week, the World Trade Organization will hold its big meeting in Hong Kong to discuss an agreement that was supposed to free up trade in farm products and manufactured goods around the world. Liberalizing farm trade helps poor countries; liberalizing trade in manufactured goods and services helps rich countries.\n        That's why it's no surprise that for the past 50 years, the world trading system has done a whole lot of the latter -- helping the industrialized nations -- without doing so much to help poorer countries. This trade pact had its beginnings in Doha, Qatar, in 2001, when the rich were reeling from Sept. 11 and talking about getting more of the world onto the global economic prosperity ladder; it was supposed to fix that distorted system.\n        Given that grand design, it is pathetic to see how this pact has been stalled by the intransigence of the European Union, which has allowed itself to become hostage to France's refusal to take its farmers off the government dole. In the past few weeks, the finger-pointing and posturing have reached new extremes. The British actor Colin Firth, of ''Bridget Jones's Diary'' fame, even presented the European Union's trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, with a petition asking that the rich world make trade rules work for the poor; the petition was said to have 10 million signatures. And Tony Blair, running on the fumes of his expiring E.U. presidency, hatched a proposal to help revive the trade talks, but it was quickly slapped down by France et al.\n        Yesterday, Brazil's president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, called President Bush to propose a meeting of world leaders in January to take up the issue.\n        That's not a bad idea because at the rate things are going, the big meeting in Hong Kong will be a bust. And that's just sad, particularly because this is the year when the big industrialized countries promised to finally do something about making poverty history. Helping poor countries is not just about debt relief and aid. It also means ending the trade-distorting giveaways that rich countries have sustained for years to coddle special interests, particularly farmers.\n        The developed world funnels nearly $1 billion a day in subsidies to its farmers, encouraging overproduction. That drives down prices and leaves farmers in poor nations unable to compete with subsidized products, even within their own countries. In recent years, farmers from America, Europe and Japan have dumped products on world markets at prices that do not begin to cover their cost of production. Europe's system is particularly odious; the United States' farm subsidies are only a third of Europe's. What's more, tariffs in agricultural products are obscenely high, in another attempt to keep the farm products of poor countries out of the supermarkets of Paris, Frankfurt and Chicago.\n        It's past time to fix this broken system, and make trade rules work for the world's poor.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1692293,"ids":1692293,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Nine years ago, Elouise Cobell sued the Interior and Treasury Departments on behalf of more than half a million Native Americans who are the beneficiaries -- if that is the right word -- of individual trusts held for them by the federal government. Since that time, she has won the legal skirmishing, but has been impeded by obstruction on the part of the government. It's time she also got real justice.\n        This case harks back to a 19th-century attempt by Washington to break up some reservations and assign land to individual Indians instead. But the new property owners were not permitted to manage any timber, oil or mineral deposits. Instead, those assets were kept in trust for them by a paternalistic federal government. And those trusts have been criminally mishandled.\n        Records have been lost and destroyed, and Indians who should have enjoyed the benefit of the valuable leases on their property have died. Ms. Cobell's successes in court -- and repeated contempt citations against the Interior Department -- have illuminated the ongoing deceit over these accounts, but they have not yet resulted in real paybacks for the defrauded Indians.

The bill calls for the Treasury and Interior Departments to figure out how much money has flowed through the individual accounts since 1980, and use that as a basis for a guesstimate of what the overall amount should be.\n        The Indians do not actually expect to get all the money that they would be entitled to based on a strict accounting. But they do want their negotiations to be based on reality. While Ms. Cobell worked hard to strike a positive note in her testimony before the committee last week, she pointed out that the bill would do nothing to uphold her consistent victories in court, and in fact would end the court's role in this case. What's worse, it would do nothing to reform the supervision of individual Indian trust accounts.\n        There are good reasons for seeking a legislative resolution to this case. The Interior and Treasury Departments have shown no willingness to come to terms with the plaintiffs. But the Indians who are owed this money cannot be paid off with good intentions. When Congress returns from its recess, Mr. McCain and Mr. Dorgan should reframe their bill in a way that has justice as its guiding purpose.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1638699,"ids":1638699,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"No matter how you look at it, the new year is not going to be as blank a slate as you hope. It never is. The starting over is always figurative, a moral effort rather than an actual fresh start. In fact, a new year like this one feels very much like the revenge of the old year. Quarterly taxes -- for 2004 -- will come due pretty soon, and then President Bush will be inaugurated. The enormous momentum of life as we know it is not poised to turn on a dime just so we can start out on Jan. 1 refreshed with possibilities. You can feel the gravity of the past pulling at your back the way real gravity pulls at your shoes.\n        But deep within us is the habit of looking forward, a habit as powerful as the belief that our lives are somehow external to us and that we can pick them up and rearrange them at will. We live profoundly in time, painfully aware of the way the new years stack up one by one.\n        We also live immersed in intention, trying to make the most of what time has to offer. There are days when the likelihood of real renewal seems almost impossible, when our lives seem utterly conditioned by the past. And then there are those days when renewal seems certain, merely a matter of making the right choices, consciously. It would be a coincidence if one of those days of rebirth happened to fall on the first of the year.\n        It's easy to dismiss the feeling of renewed intentions aroused by the new year, easy to think of resolutions as party favors of a sort, nothing more than wistful daydreams of being thinner, healthier, richer or happier than we are, forgotten as soon as made. But just ask anyone who's ever made a real change for the better. There's nothing wistful about it. It isn't a daydream. People who have fulfilled a latent possibility in themselves can sense the possibilities lying hidden in so many human lives. It doesn't take a revelation or a flash of light from heaven. It takes getting out of the habit of standing apart from your life, watching yourself as if you were two people instead of just one.\n        Most animals do not make resolutions, as far as we know. The dog isn't planning to do less dinner-table begging this year, nor is the cat going to try to take fewer catnaps. Things are as they are. But a human without hope, a human who has stopped trying to reform himself or excel herself, has a very hard time being fully human.\n        By custom, we think of New Year's Day as a personal time, a moment for thinking about the course our lives are taking. It's a private matter, we somehow feel, whether you choose to try to make any changes for the better. After all, you can't force hope on a person. But looking at the world around us, we see the need for all the hopefulness and resolution that each of us can muster We need all the commitment to change we can stir up for the year ahead.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1818421,"ids":1818421,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"No one who has followed President Bush's policies on detainees should be surprised when a member of his team scorns American notions of justice. But even by that low standard, the administration's new attack on lawyers who dare to give those prisoners the meager representation permitted them is contemptible.\n        Speaking this week on Federal News Radio, a Web site and AM radio station offering helpful hints for bureaucrats and helpful news for the administration, Cully Stimson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs, tried to rally American corporations to stop doing business with law firms that represent inmates of the Guant\u00e1namo internment camp.\n        It does not seem to matter to Mr. Stimson, who is a lawyer, that a great many of those detainees did not deserve imprisonment, let alone the indefinite detention to which they are subjected as ''illegal enemy combatants.'' And forget about the fundamental American right that everyone should have legal counsel, even the most heinous villain.\n        In his interview, reported yesterday by The Washington Post editorial page, Mr. Stimson rattled off some of the most respected law firms in the country that, after initial hesitation, have courageously respected that right. He called it ''shocking'' that they were ''representing detainees down there'' and suggested that when corporate America got word of this dastardly behavior, ''those C.E.O.'s are going to make those law firms choose between representing terrorists or representing reputable firms.'' He added: ''We want to watch that play out.''\n        When his interviewer asked who was paying these firms for the work, Mr. Stimson said, ''It's not clear, is it?''\n        Actually, it is quite clear. Mr. Stimson surely knows that the vast majority of those cases are being handled for free by law firms that have not signed on to Mr. Bush's post-9\/11 revision of the American rules of justice. Still, he persisted, saying some lawyers were ''receiving monies from who knows where.''\n        The interview was a greatest-hits remix of Bush administration nonsense about Guant\u00e1namo, including Mr. Stimson's message to corporate executives that lawyers ''are representing the very terrorists who hit their bottom line in 2001.'' The only terrorists at Guant\u00e1namo associated with 9\/11 were transferred there recently after being held for years in secret C.I.A. prisons where no lawyer could enter.\n        Not only do we find Mr. Stimson's threats appalling, we differ with him about 9\/11. The tragedy and crime of that day was that thousands of innocents were slaughtered -- not that it hurt some companies' profit margins.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1802593,"ids":1802593,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Nobody knows why the North Koreans decided to come back to the negotiating table or whether any pressure or promise could persuade them to give up their nuclear weapons. But after a year of nothing happening -- except for Pyongyang churning out more plutonium -- it is far past time to find out.\n        Administration hawks are claiming that sanctions and the threat of a naval blockade -- after last month's nuclear test -- wrestled the North back to the table. The more diplomatically minded suggest that Washington's offer to also discuss American financial sanctions may have helped tip the balance.\n        So what do we do now? The best approach is to try more of both -- pressure and promises -- and see if it works. That is pretty unremarkable advice. Except, of course, for the Bush administration, which can't decide if it wants to negotiate with Kim Jong-il or try to overthrow him.\n        Last year President Bush agreed to offer economic and security incentives to North Korea. And Pyongyang may -- or may not -- have agreed to give up its weapons. But we never got to find out because Washington quickly undercut its own offer, imposing tough new financial sanctions, ostensibly to punish the North for selling counterfeit dollars. The North walked away from the table.\n        North Korea more than deserves to be punished for testing a nuclear weapon. And the sight of a unified United Nations Security Council meting out even limited sanctions has caught its attention. We suspect that China's undeclared suspension of oil deliveries during the month of September (after the North's missile tests) also helped. That is a clear argument for the Security Council to keep up the pressure. More nudges from Beijing would help, too.\n        But this is certainly not the time for backtracking. It is also not the time for more unilateral American sanctions, intemperate rhetoric or anything else administration hawks might cook up to scuttle the talks. If President Bush is serious about trying to negotiate his way out of the nightmare of a nuclear-armed North Korea, he needs to end debate within his administration and empower Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to cut the best deal she can. She should start with a clear pledge that the United States will not try to overthrow the North Korean government if it gives up its weapons program.\n        It's impossible to know whether North Korea's Dear Leader will trade away his weapons at any price.

Jon Corzine, expected this year's budget negotiations to fly through some fiscal E-ZPass lane. Still, the barrier presented by Assembly Democrats to the governor's proposed sales tax increase led to an unsightly pileup just as the journey's end was in sight.\n        With the July 1 budget deadline approaching, the Assembly speaker, Joseph Roberts, and other top Assembly Democrats announced their opposition to the governor's plan to raise the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent. The increase would add $1.1 billion in revenue at a time when New Jersey needs to close a $4.5 billion deficit in the coming year.\n        Raising the sales tax was the simplest way of avoiding a genuine fiscal train wreck, and when he announced the proposal, Governor Corzine took pains to note that New Jersey does not impose the tax on food and clothing. That makes it somewhat less regressive. But it's far from the fairest way to raise money -- poor people still have to buy many items that come under the tax.\n        The worst thing about the sales tax idea is what Mr. Corzine liked about it most: it's a very easy way to patch up the immediate problem. The same thing goes for the grab bag of alternatives offered by the Assembly, some of which Mr. Corzine has dismissed as unrealistic.\n        The state's fiscal problems run very deep, and they cannot be resolved without painful decisions that everyone would much prefer to avoid. State labor unions have rallied behind Mr. Corzine because his budget raises money to fund benefits long promised to existing employees. But the union leadership is particularly enthusiastic because the budget does not demand any sacrifice in return. That's bad -- if the tax is to be more than just another fiscal gimmick, it must be seen as a piece of a larger effort to reform the way New Jersey finances its government. Union leaders have to realize that no true reform can be achieved without changes in work rules and benefits for future workers.\n        If this drama over a penny on the dollar seems slightly overwrought, that is because it really isn't only about the penny. Speaker Roberts, new to his job as the Assembly's leader, is trying to establish himself as a statewide figure. The governor suddenly found himself fending off a rebellion within his own party. Their battle over the tax increase is a surrogate war of sorts -- a test of resolve that other political figures will watch with great interest.\n        Mr. Corzine feels that if he can prove he is in charge now, that will make future political battles easier to win. But it's equally possible that he will simply have empowered all the people who want to put off making the hard decisions forever.\n        The real issue is whether all parties truly realize the extent of New Jersey's discontent and have the will to do something about it. Voters will find out soon enough -- legislators will be back in Trenton next month for a special session devoted to reform.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1649067,"ids":1649067,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"North Korea put all of its worst instincts on display yesterday, announcing that it had produced nuclear weapons, intends to go on producing them and has no further interest in talking. Experts already knew the North was probably producing nuclear bombs, and it has been painfully obvious for months that diplomacy was getting nowhere. But by waving its nukes around so contemptuously and then kicking over the negotiating table, North Korea has managed to make a terrible situation even worse.\n        The world cannot simply resign itself to the prospect of a nuclear-armed North Korea. It directly threatens South Korea, Japan and China. It raises the risk of nuclear blackmail against the United States, and only strengthens concerns that North Korea may be exporting nuclear ingredients and technology.\n        Stepping back from this nightmare will require a very different attitude on the part of North Korea. It will also require a drastic change of approach by the United States. The Bush administration did not create this problem, but, with a series of avoidable errors, it has made it much worse, much faster than might otherwise have been the case.\n        When President Bush took office four years ago, he immediately began distancing himself from the Clinton administration's approach, which had stopped the most imminent North Korean nuclear weapons program in its tracks. It's easy to distrust North Korea and to detest Kim Jong Il's monstrous police state. The Bush administration's response, however, was more visceral than rational, and only drove North Korea into deeper isolation and paranoia.\n        As Washington turned increasingly confrontational, North Korea unfroze its plutonium program, sent home the international inspectors and started building bombs. Still, the Bush administration put North Korea on a diplomatic back burner as it followed its obsession with Iraq.\n        The strategy of listing North Korea as one of three partners in an axis of evil and then proceeding to invade the partner that was furthest away from a nuclear weapons program was no way to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear deterrent. Washington's nonproliferation diplomacy has also been handicapped by the Bush administration's double standards about the nuclear proliferation offenses of Pakistan and other allies.\n        As if to compensate for the costly unilateralism of its Iraq adventure, Washington insisted on talking to North Korea only in the presence of four other nations, even though any deal must be built around a set of core understandings between North Korea and the United States. Then, to punish North Korea for a secret uranium-processing program, Washington waited many months before putting a serious offer on the table. North Korea apparently used the delays to build more bombs.\n        What makes this litany of diplomatic errors particularly alarming is that diplomacy is still the only path. The United States does not have any realistic military options, and intermediate steps, like United Nations sanctions, would require more international unity than the Bush administration seems able to generate. North Korea caused the problem. More enlightened, flexible and sophisticated American diplomacy must provide a way back to the negotiating table.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1837980,"ids":1837980,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Not since the Roaring Twenties have the rich been so much richer than everyone else. In 2005, the latest year for which figures are available, the top 1 percent of Americans -- whose average income was $1.1 million a year -- received 21.8 percent of the nation's income, their largest share since 1929.\n        Over all, the top 10 percent of Americans -- those making more than about $100,000 a year -- collected 48.5 percent, also a share last seen before the Great Depression.\n        Those findings are no fluke. They follow a disturbing rise in income concentration in 2003, and a sharp increase in 2004. And the trend almost certainly continues, spurred now as then by the largess of top-tier compensation, and investment gains that also flow mainly to the top. For the bottom 90 percent of Americans who are left with half the pie, average income actually dipped in 2005. The group's wages picked up in 2006, but not enough to make up for the lean years of this decade.\n        Sensing a political problem, administration officials from President Bush on down have begun acknowledging income inequality. But in their remarks, they invariably say it has been around for decades and is largely driven by technological change. Translation: ''We didn't cause it, and trying to do something about it would be silly.''\n        Let's get a few things straight: First, the economic gains of the last few years have been exceptionally skewed. From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, the gap between rich and poor widened considerably, but produced nothing like today's intense concentration of income at the very top. And from 1995 to 2000, the long trend toward inequality was interrupted by general prosperity. The richest Americans did best, propelled by stock market gains. But the lower rungs also advanced.\n        Second, government policies do matter. Part of the reason for the shared prosperity of the late 1990s was an increase in the minimum wage and a big expansion of the earned income tax credit. During the same period, a strong economy coupled with fiscal discipline -- including tax increases, spending cuts and binding budget rules -- conquered budget deficits and furthered job growth while providing a foundation for reasonably adequate social spending.\n        In contrast, the economic policies of the Bush years have failed to benefit most Americans. The tax cuts have overwhelmingly benefited the richest. As a result, the tax code does less to narrow the income gap now than it did as recently as 2000. At the same time, important social spending has been cut. That exacerbates disparities, because middle-class and poor Americans use government services more than affluent Americans.\n        The nation needs an administration that will offer solutions for the scourge of income inequality.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1835446,"ids":1835446,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Now that the General Assembly session is at the halfway mark, one Democratic legislator summed up its biggest challenge this way: ''Who is going to be the grownup?''\n        In other words, with a budget surplus and two huge proposals dominating the agenda, what's a responsible legislator to do?\n        Democrats won a veto-proof majority in both houses last year, promising to pass a law granting health care to the uninsured. That's a daunting task for any legislative session. But when Gov. M. Jodi Rell, a Republican, not only offered her own health care plan but also proposed raising the income tax to give millions more to education, Democrats blinked. They lost their single-minded focus on health care -- and the spotlight.\n        Some Democrats haven't bothered to hide their churlishness about the governor's unexpected proposal overhauling education funding. ''I don't think we'll do education this session. The governor's budget is pie-in-the-sky,'' said James Amann, a Democrat and the speaker of the house. Yet with towns clamoring for the windfall and traditional Democratic groups such as teachers unions urging support, saying no will not be easy.\n        Few quarrel with the purposes of the governor's education bill. The money is aimed at erasing the reprehensible educational disparity between Connecticut's poor and well-to-do school districts -- an achievement gap between white and minority students that is the worst of any state. The proposal also attempts to match spending with accountability. It mandates summer schools for students falling behind, all-day kindergartens, and a state takeover of systems that don't improve.\n        However, Ms. Rell still has a ways to go to sell the painful part of the proposal -- raising the income tax to pay for it. To begin with, she did a poor job of warning legislators -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- that the proposal would not be cost-free. She'll have to use her considerable persuasive powers inside the Capitol to rectify that gaffe.\n        To make matters worse, she sold the plan as a way to ease the education burden on local communities and thus reduce property taxes. But the plan did not require lower taxes even though it gave communities more money. The governor has now wisely promised to add that requirement to the bill.\n        The plan has also been criticized because some towns would get back just a fraction of what they contribute in new taxes. This is especially true in Fairfield County. Greenwich would only get back 4 cents in education money for every dollar raised in income taxes. Stamford would get 25 cents.\n        But any tax proposal has winners and losers, and this one is no different. And this, too, is clear: the state can't base its future prosperity on a large, undereducated population.\n        ''We can't promise to pay for education two years at a time,'' Governor Rell said last week. ''My budget will help pay for education for the next 20 years.''\n        Some of the opposition to the governor's proposal is kid stuff, a tantrum over political advantage. Others have legitimate concerns about the cost. There's enough time in the session for soothing egos and debating the price tag. But the bigger question remains: Can the state afford not to do this?","adu_anecdote":14,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1855424,"ids":1855424,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Now that the Group of 8 industrialized nations has pledged to commit $60 billion to combat AIDS and other diseases around the world in coming years -- a substantial sum by any reckoning -- Congress and other national legislatures ought to look hard for additional funds to close a looming gap between the funds committed and the needs of desperate patients.\n        The advanced nations -- both the G-8 countries and other donor nations -- have greatly increased their funding for AIDS programs in recent years in belated recognition that the epidemic threatens to destroy not just its victims, but also the social and economic fabric of many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We are pleased that President Bush has proposed spending some $30 billion to combat AIDS abroad over a five-year period, from 2009 to 2013, but in truth that represents only a modest increase from the spending trajectory we were already on. At its recent summit meeting, the Group of 8 pledged to commit $60 billion to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria ''over the coming years,'' including the American contribution.\n        Yet even these pledges will not be enough to keep up with the devastating epidemics. Tens of billions of dollars more will be needed to provide treatment, care and preventive services for AIDS alone over the next five years.\n        Although the Group of 8 pledges are welcome, they actually represent a retreat from previous goals. In 2005, at its meeting in Gleneagles, Scotland, the group pledged to provide ''as close as possible to universal access to treatment'' for all people suffering from AIDS by 2010. That should mean at least 10 million people in treatment by then, judging from estimates by United Nations AIDS experts. Yet at the recent meeting, the G-8 said it was aiming to treat only some five million patients in Africa by an unspecified date. That sounds like consigning millions of untreated people to death and disability.\n        To its credit, the United States has been by far the largest AIDS donor in recent years, providing almost half of the funding commitments made by donor governments. But when measured against the size of the national economy, the American donations rank only fifth. There is room to do more.\n        As Congress wrestles with the fiscal 2008 appropriations bills this year, it ought to provide the full $1.3 billion being sought by Congressional health advocates as the American contribution to a global fund to combat the three diseases -- not just $300 million as proposed by the administration or the $850 million approved by the House Appropriations Committee.

This is not idle curiosity. Unless these electronic devices are redeployed as coffee tables, they might wind up as trash on the streets of New York. That is not illegal -- although it should be. E-waste, as it is known, is toxic. It is also the next big challenge in managing the city's mountain of garbage.\n        A computer monitor or TV can contain seven pounds of lead, buried beneath the screen. Usually there are various amounts of two other heavy metals, mercury and cadmium, in the cathode ray tube or in components like circuit boards. Cellphone batteries contain some of the same pollutants.\n        Many discarded electronic devices end up with the regular trash at an incinerator in New Jersey, where they can produce toxic fumes. Or they are taken to a landfill, where pollutants leach into the soil. Within two years, there may be 500 million obsolete computers in the United States, many of them here. Add to that the televisions orphaned with the proliferation of flat-screen models, and you begin to get the picture.\n        The city has addressed the problem in a limited way, by, for example, sponsoring recycling events with equipment makers Dell and Lexmark. One event on Staten Island last fall retrieved five tons of electronics. But by one estimate, there are more than 75,000 tons of personal computers discarded yearly in the city and that doesn't count those stored by owners who would like to get rid of them. A bigger push is needed. Mayor Michael Bloomberg seemed to acknowledge that when he called for an initiative for electronics recycling in his solid waste management plan last year, a good first step, especially coming on the heels of the example the mayor has set on other recyclables. His decision to restore programs to recycle glass, plastics and metals was good for both the environment and the economy.\n        The City Council is taking its own lead on e-waste and is working on recycling legislation that may call on the Department of Sanitation to schedule several special pickup days for electronics. That promises to be a useful element in a wider solution.\n        New York can learn what not to do by studying California's struggles with an e-waste recycling program, which it finances with an upfront fee of as much as $10 on the purchase of televisions, PC's and other devices. The program has created a whole new bureaucracy and a process so inconvenient it may be discouraging participation.\n        A better approach may be to hold manufacturers responsible for the products they produce. Some companies do have programs to take back computers, although they charge the consumer. Maine -- taking a cue from European countries and Canada -- requires municipalities to help collect the items for delivery to a consolidator, who manages the recycling and bills the manufacturers. Besides providing a way to keep poisons from the air, soil and water, this system might also encourage a more intelligent and less toxic design of our machines.\n        E-waste deserves urgent attention. In the meantime, New Yorkers need to do their part and resist the urge to just dump stuff on the street. We recommend that consumers explore recycling options. One way is to go to www.nycwasteless.org and examine its lists of manufacturers' take-back programs for old computers.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":20,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1726912,"ids":1726912,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Now that there's a truce in the transit strike that should never have happened, a contract can be negotiated without using working New Yorkers as cannon fodder. The illegal walkout by the nearly 34,000 transit union members lasted through two and a half days, six commuter rush periods and countless missed appointments. The tales of perseverance are impressive, but the short strike inflicted plenty of pain -- physical, financial and emotional -- on the millions of people dependent on the city's subways and buses.\n        If winners emerge, they almost certainly won't be the transit workers. The strike was a senseless move; when the workers voted to authorize a strike, they probably never believed it would happen. Now, because of the state's Taylor Law, each worker faces a fine of two days' wages for every day missed -- in effect, about a week's pay. When the union last walked out, 25 years ago, the fines were dismissed only for those members who had verified and reasonable excuses for not working. That is probably the best the workers can expect now.\n        The city had been on a roll, by many measures, when it was stopped cold by the strike, and there's a chance to regain some momentum before year's end. No one, though, should mistake any happiness over the end of the work stoppage for approval of the people who helped to create the mess -- namely the top leadership of the union and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n        Roger Toussaint, the union president, talked about needing respect for his members after he ordered a strike that may have only diminished the public's good will toward the rank and file. The M.T.A.'s chairman, Peter Kalikow, went a long way toward meeting union demands. But he and his boss, Gov. George Pataki, clearly need to work harder to understand Mr. Toussaint's position -- or even Mr. Toussaint himself. And Mr. Toussaint, who rose to power from the rebellious back bench, should have been able to find advantage at the table without firing the only missile in his arsenal, a strike that hurt everybody except the negotiators across the table.\n        Instead of rapport at the bargaining table, there has been a clash of race, culture and class. It's unfortunate that it carried into the volley of public utterances from almost every quarter. With sensitivities running high, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, even in anger, might have found a better way than ''thuggishly'' to describe how union leaders had acted.

Through its Neediest Cases Fund, The New York Times Foundation takes a different approach. The fund reaches New Yorkers by providing cash to local charities who, in turn, dispense the money, one on one, to people most in need of help -- to put food on the table after the untimely death of a breadwinner; to buy special clothing and devices for a disabled baby; to subsidize a struggling immigrant's English lessons; to replace necessities destroyed by fire; to help a single mother pay for day care while she works and attends school. The aim of cash infusions from the fund is to inject aid that is needed when it's needed, to keep dignity alive and families intact.\n        In granting money, the fund also supports the people who have dedicated themselves to helping the needy because with the fund to fall back on, a social worker does not have to turn away a fellow New Yorker in need.\n        These are the final days of the annual fund-raising drive for The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. To date, we have raised $7.2 million, compared with $7.6 million at this time last year. The Times pays all administrative costs while directing 100 percent of the donations it receives to seven local charities: the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service; the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York; the Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens; the Children's Aid Society; the Community Service Society of New York; the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; and the UJA-Federation of New York.\n        Please send your check to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245.

They can buzz annoyingly and cast a pallid light that many people find icky. But in other respects they are amazingly easy to love. They use about 75 percent less electricity than ordinary bulbs and can last 10 times longer. Just one bulb can save its owner $30 or more over its long, virtuous life. Thinking globally, it's possible to imagine billions of bulbs saving billions of dollars and countless kilowatts, thus vastly reducing the burning of coal and the production of planet-warming carbon dioxide.\n        That is, if enough people around the globe screw them in.\n        A county legislator, Martin Rogowsky, wants to hasten that day in Westchester. He has proposed a bill to ban the use of incandescent bulbs in county buildings, thus necessitating the switch to compact fluorescents. It's a worthy goal, and one that prompts a question: How many officials would it take to change all the county's bulbs?\n        Maybe just one -- the County Executive, Andrew Spano, who could render Mr. Rogowsky's bill unnecessary simply by decreeing that the county make the bulb switch in its own buildings. The upfront costs will be high, but the savings would eventually be significant, not just in energy and money but also in effort expended by the guys who have to change them.\n        Mr. Spano is already no slouch on environmental issues, having created a county task force on global warming and begun an array of other green initiatives. He listed some in his State of the County address last Thursday, from buying more hybrid vehicles for the county fleet to proposing a bill to ban an especially dirty type of gas-burning leaf blower. He pointed out that New York ranks a dreary 45th of 50 states in buying compact fluorescent bulbs, and announced that the county would be giving away 5,000 of them, one per household, over the Earth Day weekend next month.\n        Mr. Spano and Mr. Rogowsky clearly have the right idea on bulbs. In addition to his April bulb giveaway, Mr. Spano should give Mr. Rogowsky's proposal serious consideration, and explore other ways to greatly increase the use of compact fluorescents in the county, including giving coupons and rebates to residents who can't afford to buy a lot of $8 bulbs.\n        Mr. Rogowsky's dreamy goal is nothing less than the end of incandescence in Westchester. His bill goes a bit too far by also proposing to ban the sale of incandescent bulbs in the county by 2010. That is a stretch, given the expense and short time frame, and is sure to be opposed by those who can't yet wean themselves from warm, golden glow of a bulb with a filament. But Mr. Rogowsky deserves credit for jump-starting the global-warming discussion, as does Mr. Spano for giving the county a good push in the right direction.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":4,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1651054,"ids":1651054,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Of all the claims of an electoral mandate made by President Bush's supporters, none were as bizarre as the one offered by John Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer who helped draft the cynical justifications for the illegal detention and torture of ''unlawful combatants.'' ''The debate is over,'' Mr. Yoo told The New Yorker, adding: ''The issue is dying out. The public has had its referendum.''\n        It's hard to know what is most outrageous about those comments -- that Mr. Yoo actually believes Americans voted for torturing prisoners or that an official at the heart of this appalling mess feels secure enough to say that. Certainly the worst possibility is that the public has, indeed, lost interest.\n        The White House has done everything it can to bury the issue. Nearly a year after the Abu Ghraib scandal broke, the administration still drags its feet on public disclosure, stonewalls Congressional requests for documents and suppresses the results of internal investigations.\n        But the issue is as urgent as ever. Hundreds of men remain imprisoned at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, years after any information they had might have been useful and in defiance of two Supreme Court decisions. American soldiers hold thousands of Afghan and Iraqi prisoners under rules that remain murky, to put it charitably.\n        American intelligence is still secretly detaining prisoners -- a practice that has become embarrassing enough for the Central Intelligence Agency to fret publicly about it. And the administration continues to insist that the president has an imperial right to sweep aside the law and authorize whatever he wants. That includes flouting treaties that prohibit sending prisoners to other countries to be tortured. That abhorrent practice has become more common since 9\/11 and is reported to include sending prisoners to Syria, a repressive nation counted by Washington as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n        Members of Congress from both parties are proposing new laws on interrogations. Their intentions are honorable, and new legislation may be needed. But drafts of these measures risk endorsing some terrible practices, as well as the idea that the president can declare himself above the law. Anyway, it's too soon for new laws; we still don't know what happened and who approved it.\n        But that task is now way beyond the purview of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which held important hearings on prisoner abuse. Republican Congressional leaders have made it painfully clear that they will not hold a real investigation. And no inquiry by the executive branch can be credible because the stain of prisoner abuse spreads so far. The Justice Department can't do it; Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was part of the problem.\n        We strongly agree with the American Bar Association, which wrote to President Bush on Feb. 1 to urge the appointment of an independent, bipartisan commission with subpoena power. The bar association talked about Iraqi civilians in military custody, but we believe that a panel should look at all prisoners, all detention centers and all involved government agencies.\n        Only a full accounting can begin to heal the nation's image in the world, clarify the rules, punish those responsible and clear the names of the hundreds of thousands of other uniformed Americans who risk their lives to preserve human dignity and the rule of law.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1819458,"ids":1819458,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Of all the hassles at the airport in this age of heightened security, perhaps the most annoying is the requirement to take off your shoes to send them through the X-ray screener. That burden will be lifted at some airports shortly -- for those willing to pay about $100 a year for the privilege.\n        The Transportation Security Administration has recently approved a new device that will scan your shoes while you are still wearing them. It uses quadrupole resonance technology, similar to a medical M.R.I., to determine whether explosives or weapons might be hidden in your shoes. It is the first important new technology to emerge from the for-profit registered traveler programs.\n        The hitch is that, for now, you have to pay to join a program in which private companies pledge to move you through the security lines a bit faster if you submit to a government background check in advance and supply biometric data -- like a thumbprint or iris scan -- that can be used to identify you at the airport.\n        The lead company in the field, founded by Steven Brill, operates the registered traveler lanes in Orlando, Fla., where use of the shoe scanner started yesterday, and plans to open lanes at four more airports in coming weeks. That will include Kennedy Airport, where one lane opened yesterday but with its shoe scanner not yet operational.\n        The scanner was developed for Mr. Brill's company by G.E. Security, a subsidiary of General Electric. It is part of a kiosk that also includes a device to scan fingertips for traces of chemicals that might indicate recent contact with explosives. That technology, if approved by the federal government, could make it possible for travelers to be X-rayed for hidden explosives without first having to take off their coats. Another company is exploring backscatter X-ray technology that can see through clothing to detect hidden objects, although that carries privacy implications. Also down the road is a technology to scan laptops without removing them from their cases.\n        These technology advances could become the major contribution of registered traveler programs, which otherwise simply offer those willing to pay an annual fee a designated fast lane to a set of the airport's standard metal detectors and X-ray scanners. The kiosks cost a hefty $150,000, probably too much for the government to swallow. But G.E. would surely relish a broad market, and volume production would presumably reduce the price. Someday these technologies may trickle down to us all, and the registered traveler companies will have to keep finding new devices to stay ahead.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1673408,"ids":1673408,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Of all the hollow arguments Senate Republicans have made in their attempt to scrap the opposition's right to have a say on President Bush's judicial nominees, the one that's most hypocritical insists that history is on their side in demanding a ''simple up-or-down vote'' on the Senate floor. Republicans and Democrats have used a variety of tactics, from filibuster threats to stealthy committee inaction on individual nominations, in blocking hundreds of presidential appointments across history, including about one in five Supreme Court nominees. This is all part of the Senate's time-honored deliberative role and of its protection of minority rights, which Republican leaders would now desecrate in overreaching from their majority perch.\n        Republican majorities blocked more than 60 judicial candidates during the Clinton administration by denying them committee hearings through the use of anonymous ''blue slip'' holds by individual lawmakers and a variety of other tactics just as effective, if less visible, than the filibuster. The majority leader, Bill Frist, who is zealously planning to smash the Senate rules, took part himself in a filibuster of a Clinton appeals court nominee.\n        But the majority leader is ignoring that history. With his eye clearly on a presidential run, he is playing to his party's extremist gallery by orchestrating a hazardous rules change that would block Democrats from following his example on a few of President Bush's most ideologically extreme and least qualified judicial nominees.\n        Democrats have hardly been obstructionists in their constitutional role of giving advice and consent; they have confirmed more than 200 Bush nominees, while balking at a mere seven who should be blocked on the merits, not for partisan reasons. This is a worthy fight, and the filibuster is a necessary weapon, considering that these are lifetime appointments to the powerful appellate judiciary, just below the Supreme Court. In more than two centuries, only 11 federal judges have been impeached for abusive court behavior. Clearly, uninhibited Senate debate in the deliberative stage, with the minority's voice preserved, is a crucial requirement.\n        The two nominees Senator Frist is putting forth first are singularly unqualified: The first, Priscilla Owen, has openly favored big business and flouted abortion rights on the Texas Supreme Court. The second, Janice Rogers Brown, has used her California Supreme Court post to belittle minority rights and rail against New Deal programs as a ''socialist revolution.'' Taxpayers can at least be glad that the nominees' records are being publicly aired. Republicans relied on secrecy in bottling up Clinton nominations before they ever saw the light of debate.\n        Senator Frist, with the help of Vice President Dick Cheney, would sidestep a Senate precedent requiring two-thirds' approval for a rules change and instead have a simple majority strike down the filibuster on judicial nominees. He promises that there would be no effect on other legislation, but the damage would be incalculable. Democrats are already vowing procedural paybacks and gridlock.\n        A few moderate senators from both parties -- realizing that the Senate's prestige is at stake, as much as its history -- are seeking a compromise. We hope President Bush will step in to help find a solution. Otherwise, warns his fellow Republican Arlen Specter, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the result will be the harmful crimping of minority rights in a proud deliberative body and ''a dark, protracted era of divisive partisanship.''","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1815205,"ids":1815205,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Of all the places that sexual predators could end up after prison, the worst is out of sight, away from the scrutiny and treatment that could prevent them from committing new crimes. But communities around the country are taking that risk, with zoning laws that banish pedophiles to the literal edges of society.\n        There is a powerful and wholly understandable impulse behind laws that forbid sex offenders to live within certain distances of schools, day care centers and other places that children gather. Scores of states and municipalities have created such buffer zones, then continued adding layer upon layer to the enforcement blanket.\n        This has placed a heavy burden on law enforcement agencies, which already must struggle to meet exacting federal and state requirements for registering and monitoring the ever-growing population of released sex offenders, many of whom must be tracked for life. Lawmakers have shown no hesitation in piling on the administrative load, but frequently are less quick to pay for additional people to do the work.\n        As the areas off limits to sex offenders expand to encompass entire towns and cities, if not states, the places where they can live and work are shrinking fast. The unintended consequence is that offenders have been dispersed to rural nowhere zones, where they are much harder to track. In confined regions like Long Island, they have become concentrated in a handful of low-rent, few-questions-asked areas -- an unintended and unfair imposition on their wary neighbors.\n        Many offenders respond by going underground. In Iowa, the number of registered sex offenders who went missing soared after the state passed a law forbidding offenders to live within 2,000 feet of a school or day care center. The county prosecutors' association has urged that the law be repealed, for the simple reasons that it drives offenders out of sight, requires ''the huge draining of scant law enforcement resources'' and doesn't provide the protection intended.\n        The prosecutors are right that any sense of security that such laws provide is vague at best and probably false. Just as it would feel foolish to forbid muggers to live near A.T.M.'s, it is hard to imagine how a 1,000-foot buffer zone around a bus stop, say, would keep a determined pedophile at bay. If children feel secure enough to drop their wariness of strangers, that would be a dangerous outcome. And of course, no buffer against a faceless predator will be any help to the overwhelming majority of child victims -- those secretly abused by stepfathers, uncles and other people they know.\n        The problem with residency restrictions is that they fulfill an emotional need but not a rational one. It's in everyone's interest for registered sex offenders to lead stable lives, near the watchful eyes of family and law enforcement and regular psychiatric treatment. Exile by zoning threatens to create just the opposite phenomenon -- a subpopulation of unhinged nomads off their meds with no fixed address and no one keeping tabs on them. This may satisfy many a town's thirst for retributive justice, but as a sensible law enforcement policy designed to make children safer, it smacks of thoughtlessness and failure.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1819634,"ids":1819634,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Of the many ways that President Bush has trampled civil liberties and the balance of powers since the 9\/11 attacks, one of the most egregious was his decision to order wiretaps of Americans' international calls and e-mail without court approval. It was good news, then, when the administration announced yesterday that it would now seek a warrant from the proper court for that sort of eavesdropping.\n        The president's decision hardly ends this constitutional crisis. Among other things, the public needs to know why Mr. Bush broke the law for more than five years and what should be done to ensure there will be no more abuses of the wiretap statute.\n        But we're pleased that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee that Mr. Bush had decided to end the warrantless program. He said the administration had worked out a way to speed the process of getting a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to intercept communications to and from the United States ''where there is probable cause to believe that one of the communicants is a member or agent of Al Qaeda or an associated terrorist organization.''\n        He said the court -- created by the 1978 law on domestic wiretapping -- issued an order on Jan. 10 governing this new process and that eavesdropping under ''the terrorist surveillance program'' would be subject to the court's approval. There are still some big unanswered questions. For one thing, because the new warrant process is secret, we don't know whether the court has issued a blanket approval for wiretapping, which would undermine the intent of the law, or whether the administration agreed to seek individual warrants.\n        It was also troubling that Mr. Gonzales repeated his insistence that the warrantless spying was legal. That suggests that the administration -- which has never explained why it could not have sought warrants from the start and turned down offers to amend the law -- will continue to resist legislative oversight of the wiretapping. It's also likely to argue that the lawsuits challenging the eavesdropping should be dismissed. The damage has already been done by the president's decision to ignore the law, and the lawsuits should proceed.\n        Mr. Gonzales's announcement clearly was politically timed: he will appear today before the Judiciary Committee, now controlled by Democrats who have vowed to investigate the eavesdropping.\n        We hope they will do that. Congress has a legitimate interest in the creation of this program, which has always seemed motivated more by the president's relentless campaign to expand his powers than by a real need to speed intelligence gathering.\n        We strongly agree with John Rockefeller IV, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, that ''the administration's go-it-alone approach, effectively excluding Congress and the courts and operating outside the law, was unnecessary'' and that the White House should turn over documents on the creation of the wiretapping program. If the 1978 law needs to be updated, that should happen in public, not in a secret court.\n        This administration long ago forfeited the public trust on these issues.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1842013,"ids":1842013,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Okay, Governor Spitzer and New York lawmakers.

The federal budget had been in the black for four years, and President Bush was still riding high on the $237 billion surplus he had inherited from the Clinton administration. ''We do not need the 30-year bond to meet the government's current financing needs, nor those we expect to face in coming years,'' said the administration official who announced its demise.\n        Oh, for the good old days. Since 2002, annual deficits have added nearly $1 trillion to the nation's debt, bringing it to $4.3 trillion last year, nearly double what budget experts were projecting back in 2001. Yet the Treasury says that the nation's ballooning indebtedness is not a factor in its recent decision to consider reissuing the 30-year bond. Not a factor?\n        In the real world, reviving the 30-year bond would mean acknowledging that the nation's growing debt burden will eventually cause long-term interest rates to rise. Right now, however, those rates are abnormally low. So reverting to the 30-year bond would lock in low rates on future government borrowing. That would be a good thing for taxpayers, whose taxes go to pay the bonds' interest. But coming out and saying so would expose one of the administration's biggest failings: it has created the conditions for higher interest rates by squandering the Clinton-era surpluses and piling on debt. Locking in low rates with a 30-year bond is clever, but it is no substitute for cutting the deficit and reducing the national debt, something the powers-that-be have no credible plan for doing.\n        A move to bring back the bond also flags the danger of America's immense borrowing from abroad. Without a 30-year bond, the average maturity of the debt held by foreigners has been falling -- to 54 months this year from 60 months in 2003. Such short maturities -- together with a depreciating dollar -- make financial markets fearful that in the near term, foreign lenders may choose to invest in other currencies' assets when their dollar-based debt matures, forcing the United States to raise rates, perhaps sharply, to attract the loans it needs. The 30-year bond would alleviate some of that anxiety. But again, it's no substitute for curbing the borrowing itself.\n        There is nothing objectionable, per se, about the 30-year bond. But if the nation were on a path to paying off its debt and accumulating assets for the future, as it was in the years before the Bush binge, there would be little need for it now.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1665034,"ids":1665034,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"On Monday the New York Public Library announced that it had decided to sell 19 artworks in order to ease the financial shortfall that has plagued the library -- and reduced branch hours -- since 9\/11. And on Tuesday, the Museum of Modern Art announced that David Rockefeller had given the museum its largest cash gift, $100 million, for its endowment in support of public programs. Mr. Rockefeller's generous gift, which is wholly in keeping with his family's commitment to MoMA, is one version of the wealth that keeps New York's cultural institutions afloat. But so, in a different way, is the library's decision.\n        No one at the library, which is largely financed by private contributions, pretends that having to sell paintings to raise money is a good thing. But it is a far better thing than having no paintings to sell in the first place. That is the predicament that most libraries in this nation now face. By choosing to sell these paintings, including Asher B. Durand's ''Kindred Spirits'' and two Gilbert Stuart portraits of George Washington, the library has chosen to use a part of its material endowment to support its core mission, which is its research collection and its public outreach. Again, most libraries in America do not have that luxury. Their core mission has been cut to the bone. In far too many places, libraries struggle to stay open for more than a few hours a week.\n        The Museum of Modern Art and the New York Public Library are both proud examples of what private support can accomplish. The two institutions have nearly the same size endowment, but the library -- a public library, after all -- cannot charge admission to help offset its costs.\n        The sale of these artworks is, in some sense, a tax on the past, a way to use the value that has built up over the years. But it is also -- and this is the regrettable part -- a tax on the future. The most important of these paintings are currently on view in the Edna Barnes Solomon Room on the third floor of the library. The odds are very good that they will be sold into private hands.\n        We are used to thinking of museums and libraries as the final resting place for cultural treasures. But that clearly depends on public will, including federal support, and prosperous financial times. It is easy to imagine that, years hence, some family will endow another museum or library with the very works that the public library has chosen to sell.\n        It's hard to overstate the importance of private wealth to such institutions. But what underlies this private wealth -- what creates the audience for MoMA and the library -- is public wealth: local, state, and federal support for libraries across the country. Without that, the value of magnanimous private contributions is essentially undermined.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1655607,"ids":1655607,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"On Monday, President Bush nominated John Bolton, an outspoken critic of multinational institutions and a former Jesse Helms prot\u00e9g\u00e9, to be the representative to the United Nations. We won't make the case that this is a terrible choice at a critical time. We can let Mr. Bolton do it for us by examining how things might look if he had his way:\n        The United States could resolve international disputes after vigorous debate with itself. In an interview in 2000 on National Public Radio, Mr. Bolton told Juan Williams, ''If I were redoing the Security Council today, I'd have one permanent member because that's the real reflection of the distribution of power in the world.''\n        ''And that one member would be, John Bolton?'' Mr. Williams queried.\n        ''The United States,'' Mr. Bolton replied.\n        America could stop worrying about China In 1999, when he was senior vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, Mr. Bolton wrote a column in The Weekly Standard advocating that the United States just go ahead and give Taiwan diplomatic recognition, despite the fact that this purely symbolic gesture was a point on which China had repeatedly threatened to go to war. He made this argument: ''Diplomatic recognition of Taiwan would be just the kind of demonstration of U.S. leadership that the region needs and that many of its people hope for. The notion that China would actually respond with force is a fantasy, albeit one the Communist leaders welcome and encourage in the West.''\n        . . . and North Korea. In 1999, Mr. Bolton told The Los Angeles Times: ''A sounder U.S. policy would start by making it clear to the North that we are indifferent to whether we ever have 'normal' diplomatic relations with it, and that achieving that goal is entirely in their interests, not ours. We should also make clear that diplomatic normalization with the U.S. is only going to come when North Korea becomes a normal country.''\n        U.N. dues? What U.N. dues? In 1997, Mr. Bolton wrote in a column in The Wall Street Journal that the United States isn't legally bound to pay its United Nations dues. ''Treaties are 'law' only for U.S. domestic purposes,'' he said. ''In their international operations, treaties are simply 'political' obligations.''\n        And forget about the International Criminal Court. In 2000, Mr. Bolton told the House International Relations Committee this: ''Support for the International Criminal Court concept is based largely on emotional appeals to an abstract ideal of an international judicial system unsupported by any meaningful evidence and running contrary to sound principles of international crisis resolution.''\n        We certainly look forward to Mr. Bolton's confirmation hearings, and, after that, his performance at the United Nations, where he will undoubtedly do a fine job continuing the Bush administration's charm offensive with the rest of the world.\n        Which leaves us wondering what Mr. Bush's next nomination will be.

Shops and offices will not open, factories will be idle, and classrooms and restaurants will empty out. The nation will rattle with the emptiness of millions of immigrants not working, not shopping and not going to school.\n        The noise is supposed to come later, when many of those same immigrants hit the streets, protesting and chanting in a continental chorus of complaint. Their din will be joined by a moan rising from the rest of America, newly exposed as a fat, immobile queen lost without her worker bees. The shaken nation then will buckle and pass forgiving laws that loosen its borders and grant the 11 million to 12 million illegal workers their rightful place in the American landscape.\n        That's the plan, anyway. But a few things are seriously wrong with it.\n        The groups that chose May 1 for a day of boycotts and rallies for immigrants' rights were emboldened by a miracle of grass-roots mobilization that turned a shadow population into a national movement in less than a month. But many outspoken defenders of the immigrants' cause are drawing a distinction between peaceful rallies and punitive boycotts and work stoppages. They say, rightly, that immigrants should not try to inflict pain on this country just to prove how much they love it.\n        Those who argue for aggressive confrontation point to the civil rights era, when another supposedly powerless minority found the strength to upend an exploitive system that dangled the possibility of hope while mocking and thwarting it. But that is a superficial comparison. Segregation denied the legal rights and full humanity of American citizens. It was a brutal regime that had to be dismantled. By comparison, current and proposed immigration laws -- even the most punitive ones -- are at worst foolish, impractical and ungenerous. But they are not Jim Crow. To say otherwise is to trivialize evil.\n        Today's immigrants and their allies have a different, but no less admirable, mission than the 1960's protesters. They are calling on the nation to improve its laws, to draw on a rich tradition of tolerance in devising a fair, decent solution to a complex problem.\n        Whether Monday's protests stumble or soar, participants should strive to avoid damaging their worthy cause. Boycotts and walkouts could cause many struggling workers to lose their jobs, send students the wrong message about the importance of education, give the Minutemen and talk-show morons a chance to strut and preen, and unnerve and embolden the lawmakers who are itching for a simple crackdown. This is perilous business: there are signs that fear has already given the boycott a perverse head start. Recent rumors of federal immigration crackdowns appear to have driven thousands of illegal immigrants further underground.\n        There needs to be a lot of heavy lifting and delicate consensus building to achieve comprehensive immigration reform. Sleeping giants can, and should, get moving. But they should tread carefully.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1831807,"ids":1831807,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"On Sunday in Basra, British troops stormed an Iraqi intelligence office and found about 30 prisoners, some of them tortured. Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki was outraged -- not at the torture, but at the raid that halted it. Soon British troops will be leaving Basra, leaving Mr. Maliki and his security forces free to do as they please.\n        On Monday in Baghdad, a suicide bomber attacked a row of bookstores, killing 20 people. The White House insists that Baghdad is growing more secure, as the extra infusion of American troops ordered by President Bush begins to take up positions in threatened neighborhoods. And on it went. On Tuesday, sectarian attacks killed at least 118 Shiite pilgrims. Then on Thursday, The Times reported that the day-to-day commander of American forces in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, was recommending that those extra 21,500 combat troops -- plus the 7,000 support troops Mr. Bush somehow forgot to mention -- stay on into next year. On the same day, General Odierno's boss, Gen. David Petraeus, said that even more American troops could be needed in the near future.\n        Anyone who wanted to believe that all Mr. Bush was seeking was a short-term security push -- as part of a larger strategy to extricate American troops from this unwinnable war -- now needs to face up to a far less palatable reality. What is under way is a significant and long-term escalation. The Army cannot sustain these levels for more than another few months. And as long as Iraq's leaders refuse to make significant political changes, the civil war will continue to spin out of control.\n        With this backdrop, it is somewhat reassuring to see Congressional Democrats getting a little smarter in their gathering efforts to force a policy change. They are still talking about a phased withdrawal and an arbitrary exit date. That's an approach we've never favored without a parallel political strategy to try to contain the chaos and regional strife that are likely to follow. What they can usefully do, and are attempting, is to use the power of the purse constructively to force the White House to give American troops the kind of support they need and to demand some sanity from Iraq's leaders.\n        Rather than trying to challenge the administration's request for $100 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan, House Democrats now want to add funds to speed the production and delivery of badly needed protective armor, provide better medical care for wounded troops and veterans, and shore up the Army's eroding combat readiness.\n        A supplemental financing bill amended this way would be hard for senators to vote against or for Mr. Bush to veto. House Democrats also want to make it a vehicle for prodding the White House into imposing benchmarks and timetables on an Iraqi government that still refuses to purge its security forces of sectarian thugs and reach out to the country's Sunni Arab minority. We hope they succeed.\n        In what may have been this week's only good news out of Iraq, a growing number of parliamentarians have begun challenging Prime Minister Maliki's destructive policies. There is talk about forming a political bloc that would cross rather than reinforce the sectarian divide. If the White House won't demand more from Mr. Maliki, Congressionally enacted benchmarks could help empower Iraq's more moderate politicians. Without a more enlightened Iraqi government -- and a tougher policy from Washington -- next week, and the weeks and months to come, will be no better than the last.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":18,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1803408,"ids":1803408,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"On Tuesday, the voters told President Bush that they wanted him to come up with an exit strategy in Iraq. Yesterday, Mr. Bush accepted the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Announcing his decision, the president sounded cranky, and his insistence that Mr. Rumsfeld had done a great job was ridiculous. But everyone would like this to be the beginning of a new era, and it seems best to simply applaud the decision. Whether Mr. Bush understands what a failure Mr. Rumsfeld has been is far less important than whether he is really prepared to rethink the Iraq strategy now.\n        What was far more worrisome was Mr. Bush's repeated insistence that neither he nor the American people would countenance withdrawal without ''victory.'' If the president still imagines that the American occupation will end in some kind of foreign policy triumph for the United States, neither the election nor Mr. Rumsfeld's abrupt ouster have had any real impact at all. We're still waiting for a sign that Mr. Bush has grasped the steady unraveling of his Iraq strategy as anything beyond a political problem.\n        The challenge for Mr. Rumsfeld's chosen successor, Robert Gates, who was a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Bush's father and then served as director of central intelligence, will be to bring home to the president how desperate the situation has become in Iraq and to see that the war's conduct from here on is dictated by reality, not ideology.\n        That would be a truly revolutionary departure from the current era, when a succession of dubious Rumsfeld doctrines failed the reality test yet remained official policy.\n        Mr. Rumsfeld, you remember, was absolutely certain that Iraq could be transformed with less than half the troops that a generation of senior generals had thought necessary. He was wrong, but it was the Army's top general who lost his job. Similar travesties played out over postwar planning and over reconstruction contracts. At some point, people must have stopped telling Mr. Rumsfeld what was really going on, fearing his wrath or retaliation.\n        Mr. Gates's most urgent task, assuming he is confirmed, must be to reopen those necessary channels of communication with military, intelligence and foreign service professionals on the ground. After hearing what they have to say, he needs to recommend a realistic new strategy to Mr. Bush in place of the one that is now demonstrably failing.\n        That is not all he needs to do. He will have to rebuild a badly overstretched Army, refocus military transformation by trading in unneeded cold war weapons for new technologies more relevant to current needs, and nurture a more constructive relationship with Congressional oversight committees.\n        But Iraq must come first. Mr. Rumsfeld's departure has to be followed by a major change in policy if American troops can be brought home without leaving a disaster behind.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1671831,"ids":1671831,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"On Tuesday, when it received a federal bankruptcy court's permission to terminate its pension plans, United Airlines became the biggest pension defaulter in the history of corporate America. Analysts fear that Delta may also default, as well as other ailing airlines, followed by auto parts companies and perhaps even, in five years or so, the carmakers themselves.\n        When the court's decision is finalized, United will unload $6.6 billion of obligations onto the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency that insures corporate pensions. Some of the 134,000 employees and retirees of United will see little change in their retirement payouts because the government insures a big chunk of promised benefits -- up to $45,614 this year for someone retiring at age 65. But for others, especially pilots, who typically accumulate six-figure pensions and must retire at age 60, the cuts will be draconian.\n        Sadly, it's too late to offer relief to the burned United employees. But their plight should compel Congress to learn the right lessons and take the necessary steps to protect Americans' pensions.\n        There are, for instance, loopholes in the law that is supposed to penalize companies for underfunding their pensions. Currently, the government estimates that, at most, 20 percent of a total of $450 billion in underfunding is due to financial distress at companies. The rest is occurring at businesses that are financially healthy and are simply dodging their responsibility to put the proper resources into their pensions.\n        Congress must also raise the premiums that corporations pay the government for federal pension insurance, something that hasn't been done since 1994. This is politically difficult because corporations obviously don't want to pay higher premiums. Unions, fearing that corporations will cut back or drop pensions if forced to pay more, have not been lobbying for the change. But study after study shows that premiums are underpriced by one-sixth to one-half. No wonder that with the United default, the pension agency's deficit will rise to $23 billion; as recently as 2001, it had a surplus of $7.7 billion.\n        If the pension agency itself was pushed toward bankruptcy, some 40 million Americans who are covered by traditional corporate pensions would be more vulnerable to catastrophic losses. In addition, taxpayers would be called upon to rescue another failing federal institution, as in the savings and loan bailout of the 1980's.\n        The United debacle also holds a broader lesson about retirement security. The level of risk that exists in pensions and other retirement savings plans has no place in the core tier of retirement savings, Social Security. If lawmakers and policy makers are not yet convinced of that, they should talk to the people at United.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1829888,"ids":1829888,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"On Wednesday, Congress took its first crack at immigration reform since the great nothing of 2006. The Senate Judiciary Committee invited Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez to testify on the issue. With a new Congress and a new comprehensive immigration bill expected to be introduced in the Senate within days, the hearing could have been the first spark of a rejuvenated campaign by an alliance of Congressional Democrats, moderate Republicans and the Bush administration to finally solve a problem that has festered for too long.\n        It wasn't. That's because both Mr. Chertoff and Mr. Gutierrez slunk away from a central pillar of comprehensive reform: a path to citizenship that would give illegal immigrants -- the ones who wait and prove they deserve it -- the chance to participate fully and proudly in the life of this country.\n        Polls show that most Americans would let illegal immigrants get right with the law and become Americans, too, if they have clean records, learn English and pay back taxes and fines. Weighed against keeping the shadowy status quo or deporting 12 million people, a citizenship path strikes them as a proper blend of justice and common sense. Last year's stalled Senate bill took this approach, and it will surely be central to any new legislation.\n        But the idea sticks in the craws of the members of a vocal, mostly Republican faction that wants every door to opportunity for illegal immigrants shut and locked, except the one marked ''guest workers.'' Those they would keep because they don't mind having an underclass of docile, ill-paid foreigners who do America's dirtiest jobs and then go home.\n        There is a place for some temporary workers in the American economy. But such programs are highly prone to abuse and are not a solution for the vast numbers of illegal immigrants already here.\n        Mr. Gutierrez and Mr. Chertoff enthusiastically talked up guest-worker programs on Wednesday, but pointedly left citizenship off the table. They could have been talking tactically, working at President Bush's behest to soothe the passions of skeptical Republicans. But there must be a limit to the accommodations given to anti-amnesty ideologues. If Mr. Bush has the stomach to fight for the real reform he says he wants, he is hiding it well.\n        Mr. Bush said nothing about a path to citizenship in his State of the Union address in January.

Homeowners in Biloxi, Miss., staggered through wrecked neighborhoods looking for their loved ones. In New Orleans, the mayor reported that rescue boats had begun pushing past dead bodies to look for the stranded living. Gas leaks began erupting into flames, and looking at the city, now at least 80 percent under water, it was hard not to think of last year's tsunami, or even ancient Pompeii.\n        Disaster has, as it almost always does, called up American generosity and instances of heroism. Young people helped the old onto rafts in flooded New Orleans streets, and exhausted rescue workers refused all offers of rest, while people as far away as Kansas and Arizona went online to offer shelter in their homes to the refugees. It was also a reminder of how much we rely on government to imagine the unimaginable and plan for the worst. As the levees of Lake Pontchartrain gave way, flooding New Orleans, it seemed pretty clear that in this case, government did not live up to the job.\n        But this seems like the wrong moment to dwell on fault-finding, or even to point out that it took what may become the worst natural disaster in American history to pry President Bush out of his vacation. All the focus now must be on rescuing the survivors. Beyond that lies a long and painful recovery, which must begin with a national vow to help all the storm victims and to save and repair New Orleans.\n        People who think of that graceful city and the rest of the Mississippi Delta as tourist destinations must have been reminded, watching the rescue operations, that the real residents of this area are in the main poor and black. The only resources most of them will have to fall back on will need to come from the federal government.\n        Those of us in New York watch the dire pictures from Louisiana with keen memories of the time after Sept. 11, when the rest of the nation made it clear that our city was their city, and that everyone was part of the battle to restore it. New Orleans, too, is one of the places that belongs to every American's heart -- even for people who have never been there.\n        Right now it looks as if rescuing New Orleans will be a task much more daunting than any city has faced since the San Francisco fire of 1906.

They cited passages in the bill that suspend the fundamental principle of habeas corpus, making Mr. Bush the first president since the Civil War to take that undemocratic step.\n        Not satisfied with having won the vote, Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, quickly issued a statement accusing Democrats who opposed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 of putting ''their liberal agenda ahead of the security of America.'' He said the Democrats ''would gingerly pamper the terrorists who plan to destroy innocent Americans' lives'' and create ''new rights for terrorists.''\n        This nonsense is part of the Republicans' scare-America-first strategy for the elections. No Democrat advocated pampering terrorists -- gingerly or otherwise -- or giving them new rights. Democratic amendments to the bill sought to protect everyone's right to a fair trial while providing a legal way to convict terrorists.\n        Americans will hear more of this ahead of the election. They also will hear Mr. Bush say that he finally has the power to bring to justice a handful of men behind the 9\/11 attacks. The truth is that Mr. Bush could have done that long ago, but chose to detain them illegally at hidden C.I.A. camps to extract information. He sent them to Guant\u00e1namo only to stampede Congress into passing the new law.\n        The 60 or so men at Guant\u00e1namo who are now facing tribunals -- out of about 450 inmates -- also could have been tried years ago if Mr. Bush had not rebuffed efforts by Congress to create suitable courts. He imposed a system of kangaroo courts that was more about expanding his power than about combating terrorism.\n        While the Republicans pretend that this bill will make America safer, let's be clear about its real dangers. It sets up a separate system of justice for any foreigner whom Mr. Bush chooses to designate as an ''illegal enemy combatant.'' It raises insurmountable obstacles for prisoners to challenge their detentions. It does not require the government to release prisoners who are not being charged, or a prisoner who is exonerated by the tribunals.\n        The law does not apply to American citizens, but it does apply to other legal United States residents. And it chips away at the foundations of the judicial system in ways that all Americans should find threatening. It further damages the nation's reputation and, by repudiating key protections of the Geneva Conventions, it needlessly increases the danger to any American soldier captured in battle.\n        In the short run, voters should see through the fog created by the Republican campaign machine.

Not so the current secretary, Alphonso Jackson, who, in a talkative visit back home to Texas, let an audience of business leaders in on the bare-knuckled political bias that taints the administration's contract awarding process.\n        Mr. Jackson recounted meeting a minority publisher seeking a contract with the agency. ''He made a heck of a proposal,'' the secretary recalled. ''Then he said something.  He said, 'I don't like President Bush.' ''\n        A deal-breaking utterance.\n        ''He didn't get the contract,'' said the secretary, making no apologies about such constitutional niceties as free speech or the fairness requisites of federal procurement law. ''Why should I reward someone who doesn't like the president, so they can use funds to try to campaign against the president?''\n        Once a well-deserved storm of criticism inundated Mr. Jackson, he backtracked, insisting he simply made the story up ''anecdotally'' and there was no denied petitioner or contract. Whether real or imagined, however, the story drove home the secretary's rhetorical point all too well: political fealty trumps merit in the administration's dealings with contractors.\n        Up on Capitol Hill, the former Republican majority leader, Tom DeLay, made this open dogma in setting up his K Street project to pressure lobbyists to favor the G.O.P. with donations if they wanted access and favors. Secretary Jackson haplessly revealed a similar pay-to-play mind-set in his tale of how contract money is, of course, presumed to cycle back in political donations -- and a petitioner had better be pro-presidential.\n        Like Mr. Reagan, President Bush is unenthusiastic about HUD's entire mandate, particularly the part about using government resources to provide affordable housing for the poor. And like Mr. Reagan, he picked a secretary who seemed well qualified to preside over failure. Mr. Jackson has had earlier foot-in-mouth moments. He suggested only the ''best'' residents should be allowed public housing in the New Orleans restoration, and, as under secretary, he threatened a ''whupping'' to motivate agency workers. Congressional opposition has been the only roadblock to his dismantling federal programs for low-income housing.\n        This would be the moment at which we would normally call on the president to ask for Mr. Jackson's resignation. But the country has long since learned that Mr. Bush does not regard poor performance as a firing offense, though the record on that score is clear.

But his trickiest moment may have been his decision to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the bizarre shenanigans involving his predecessor as attorney general, Zulima Farber.\n        Ms. Farber came to office with unusual baggage: a history of accumulating speeding tickets -- 12 in all -- license suspensions and four bench warrants for failing to appear in court to answer traffic violations. Mr. Corzine dismissed the violations as ''not a substantive issue.'' Last Memorial Day, however, Ms. Farber responded personally to a distress call from her companion, Hamlet Goore, who had been pulled over by police because he was not wearing a seatbelt. Mr. Goore was also driving with a suspended license and an expired registration.\n        After Ms. Farber arrived on the scene in a state car, driven by a state trooper, with lights flashing, the police allowed Mr. Goore to go home. A special prosecutor later found that Ms. Farber had violated ethics laws by, in effect, seeking special treatment from the police. And that, in turn, ended her brief and tumultuous career as attorney general.\n        Leaders of both parties, not least the governor, hope Mr. Rabner will bring a measure of stability to an office where turmoil has been the rule. In addition to the episode involving Ms. Farber, her predecessor, Peter Harvey, was criticized for accepting free tickets to a boxing match; an earlier attorney general, Peter Verniero, admitted that he had not adequately pursued racial-profiling complaints charging state troopers with stopping black and Hispanic drivers on the basis of race and ethnicity.\n        As New York's Eliot Spitzer, Connecticut's Richard Blumental and others have demonstrated, a conscientious and creative attorney general can be a powerful advocate for consumers, the environment and fair play in the marketplace -- especially at a time when the federal government seems increasingly inattentive to its own obligations in these areas.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1838707,"ids":1838707,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"One important item that hit the cutting room floor recently when New York lawmakers produced a new state budget was the Bigger, Better Bottle Bill.

It was a shabby but deserved ending to almost 15 years of rule by a man who was once praised as Central Asia's most democratically inclined leader. Of course, that is something of a backhanded compliment in a region where repressive troglodytes are the norm.\n        Over the years, Mr. Akayev's political views became less enlightened as he grew more attached to the rewards of power. He showed no qualms about jailing opposition leaders, rigging elections and grooming his daughter as a possible successor. The most recent election fraud, in parliamentary voting earlier this month, set off the nationwide protests that finally sent him running.\n        Kyrgyzstan has now followed the examples of Georgia and Ukraine, which threw out the corrupt cliques that latched on to power after the Soviet Union fell part in 1991. It needs to keep emulating them by holding early elections to establish a democratically legitimate government. Once it does, Kyrgyzstan itself can set a positive example for the remaining misruled and undemocratic post-Soviet republics, particularly its nearby neighbors -- Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. All five Central Asian republics are examples of the kind of despotic misgovernment that the West has been too willing to accept and even collude with in the Muslim world.\n        It has been Central Asia's unhappy fate over the years to get swept up in rivalries among major powers -- initially Russia and Britain; now Russia, China and the United States. That pattern was reinforced after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, when the Bush administration began courting the region's rulers and minimizing their dictatorial abuses to secure air bases near Afghanistan. One particularly useful base is located in Kyrgyzstan, just outside Bishkek. That may explain why the State Department voiced only mild criticism of this month's election fraud, while taking the opposition to task for taking over and trashing government buildings. What a contrast with Washington's forthright support for huge antigovernment protests in Kiev last year and in Beirut earlier this month.\n        The hasty flight of Mr. Akayev shows just how shortsighted such cynical realpolitik can be. The best thing America can do now for Kyrgyzstan is work with democracies in Europe and elsewhere to help it move from the chaos of this week's upheaval toward a more stable democratic future.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1816101,"ids":1816101,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"One of the big winners in the last election may turn out to be the principle, known as net neutrality, that Internet service providers should not be able to favor some content over others. Democrats who are moving into the majority in Congress -- led by Ron Wyden in the Senate and Edward Markey in the House -- say they plan to fight hard to pass a net neutrality bill, and we hope that they do. It is vital to preserve the Internet's role in promoting entrepreneurship and free expression.\n        Internet users now get access to any Web site on an equal basis. Foreign and domestic sites, big corporate home pages and little-guy blogs all show up on a user's screen in the same way when their addresses are typed into a browser. Anyone who puts up a Web page can broadcast it to the world.\n        Cable and telephone companies are talking, however, about creating a two-tiered Internet with a fast lane and a slow lane. Companies that pay hefty fees would have their Web pages delivered to Internet users in the current speedy fashion. Companies and individuals that do not would be relegated to the slow lane.\n        Creating these sorts of tiers would destroy the democratic quality of the Internet. Big, wealthy voices would start to overpower the smaller, poorer ones. Innovation would be threatened if start-ups and small companies could not afford the new fees. The next eBay or Google might never be born.\n        A net neutrality law would require cable and telephone companies to continue to provide Web sites to Internet users on an equal basis. Mr. Markey, of Massachusetts, will be taking over a key subcommittee that handles Internet issues. He has promised to hold hearings to educate Congress and the public, and to reintroduce his strong net neutrality bill. Mr. Wyden, of Oregon, plans to reintroduce an equally solid bill in the Senate.\n        Passing the legislation will not be easy. The cable and telephone companies have fought net neutrality with a lavishly financed and misleading lobbying campaign, because they stand to gain an enormous windfall. But there is growing support from individuals and groups across the political spectrum, from MoveOn.org to the Gun Owners of America, who worry about what will happen to their free speech if Internet service providers are allowed to pick and choose the traffic they carry.\n        In the last week, there was a limited but important victory for net neutrality. As a condition of approving the AT&amp;T-BellSouth merger, the Federal Communications Commission required AT&amp;T to guarantee net neutrality on its broadband service for the next two years. The commission was right to extract this concession, but it should not be necessary to negotiate separate deals like this one. On the information superhighway, net neutrality should be a basic rule of the road.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1808715,"ids":1808715,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"One of the many victims of Hurricane Katrina may turn out to be the hospitality that American cities, particularly Houston, showed to people fleeing the storm. Thanks largely to the Bush administration's catastrophic handling of the relocation crisis, Houston endured much more civic strain than it should have in caring for the tens of thousands of Louisianans who landed on its doorstep.\n        The administration's mishandling of the crisis has often looked like a calculated attempt to discourage displaced people from seeking housing aid, even if it means leaving them vulnerable to homelessness. A federal district court judge implied as much this week, when he found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency's aid application process was so convoluted and confusing as to be unconstitutional -- and likened it to something out of a horror story by Kafka.\n        Judge Richard Leon ruled that FEMA had unconstitutionally denied housing aid to thousands of residents who were displaced by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. He ordered the government to resume payments immediately, pointing to blind alleys and contradictory information that often led vulnerable families to lose aid without understanding why or having reasonable recourse to appeal.\n        In Houston, people are at least being housed now in apartments rather than remote trailer camps where other displaced Louisianans have now been trapped for more than a year . But throughout this saga, FEMA has whipsawed the survivors and their host communities with unpredictable policy changes that have hindered the resettlement process and kept everyone on edge. Despite those obstacles, many have managed to get on their feet.\n        But Houston must still worry about impoverished and hard-to-employ refugees who represent an enormous burden in health care, law enforcement and education costs. City officials also say that the federal government has been unpredictably late and tightfisted with badly needed aid.\n        The administration made its most disastrous misstep when it failed to enlist the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which was created to deal with just these kinds of situations. If the administration had provided Section 8 housing vouchers through HUD, families could have been directed to affordable housing all over the country. No one city would have been asked to absorb tens of thousands of people.\n        Congress needs to make sure that its housing application process is rendered intelligible. But it needs to go much further. It has to make sure that the survivors who qualify are given aid through programs like Section 8 that allow them to pick up their lives quickly, and that there will be no more Houstons in the American history of disaster response.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1828749,"ids":1828749,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"One of the more important hearings of this legislative session occurred Feb. 13, but only about a dozen people attended. It took place before a legislative subcommittee that is taking baby steps toward making the state government justify how and why it is spending our money. This process has the eye-glazing name of ''results-based accountability,'' but forget labels; it's one of the few serious attempts that has taken place in years to bring scrutiny, not to mention sanity, to the budget process.\n        Most people run their household budgets by, at minimum, trying to avoid wasting money. But state government isn't like that. Sometimes hearings in the General Assembly will spotlight certain programs that are succeeding or failing, but those are rarities. Connecticut's money management involves line-item budgeting. Most expenditures in the state budget are approved with a few percentage points added for inflation. The system does not keep track of money, rarely measures performance and, too often, rewards failure.\n        But change is in the air. Last year, the legislature started a pilot project on results-based accountability. This year the House speaker, James Amann, made it a subcommittee under the Joint Committee on Appropriations. The subcommittee could not tackle the entire budget, so it picked a few areas to examine, among them early childhood programs for children from birth to 5 years of age. The Department of Environmental Protection, to its credit, volunteered for scrutiny of its stewardship of Long Island Sound.\n        The chairwoman of the subcommittee, Representative Diana Urban, a Democrat who is also an economist, set forth questions concerning goals, how much money is spent in pursuit of them, and how success or failure is measured. She also asked for low-cost or no-cost alternatives to achieving the goals. The basic question is simple: What works?\n        The answers were revealing. First, the state spends $533 million on birth-to-5 programs, most of it on preparing children for school. The money is scattered across at least seven agencies, and there is little (and in some cases no) data on how effective it is. Making one agency responsible for administering this money would go a long way toward helping the effort succeed.\n        The D.E.P.'s testimony raised different issues. Asked to measure its performance against the goal of a clean Long Island Sound, the agency said that by several measures the Sound was becoming more polluted, a consequence of cuts in the state's Clean Water Fund. Proposed increases in the governor's budget should help matters. The agency has also suggested a public education campaign to help people lessen their use of fertilizer, to reduce the runoff flowing into the Sound. But scrutiny revealed that two-thirds of the department's budget comes from hunters, fishermen, state parks and federal funds. It is extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in funding that have occurred in recent years, something few lawmakers were aware of until the hearing.\n        No one expects the legislature to obtain this level of detail from all state agencies -- yet. But the effort is already making waves. ''We want to turn the budget on its head,'' said the Appropriations chairwoman, Representative Denise Merrill, a Democrat. If she had her way, she said, each agency would put on one sheet of paper its goals and proof that what it is doing works. That will not happen this year, or the next. But more accountability is welcome -- and overdue.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1661410,"ids":1661410,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"One of the most astonishing things about the human experience is the realization that loved ones die. The first time it happens, we are invariably amazed that nearly everyone who has ever lived has weathered an experience so wrenching. We see other humans on the street and in the shops and marvel that they manage to simply go about their business -- that there is no constant, universal primal scream in the face of such an awful fact.\n        That level of grief seldom brings out the noblest emotions. The sufferers can barely make their way through the day, let alone summon their best reserves of patience and compassion for the lucky people who continue to live. In the case of Terri Schiavo, the whole world witnessed what happens when that natural emotional frailty is taken captive by politics.\n        It was awful, and according to the polls, the American public shrank from the sight of it.\n        What little we know about Terri Schiavo -- the person, as opposed to the videotape -- tells us that she would have been appalled by the last weeks of her life. What worse nightmare could a rather shy and affectionate young woman conjure up than 15 years of lingering unconsciousness, in which the entire globe became intimately familiar with the sight of her wasted limbs while the people she loved most engaged in a vicious court fight for control of her body?\n        That kind of ordeal -- even if the victim was unaware she was enduring it -- deserves to be honored with some meaning. On the most pragmatic level, she has been the instrument of thousands, and probably millions, of intimate conversations in which family members told one another what they would like to happen if their own bodies outlived their minds. In countless other cases, people recalled the days on which they had said goodbye to loved ones, and perhaps many came closer to peace in dealing with their own great losses.\n        Americans are a deeply pragmatic people, who constantly surprise ideologues of every persuasion with their willingness to accept whatever solution seems to work best at the moment. Our great ideals, when they are boiled down at a moment of crisis, often turn out to be mainly instincts -- for fairness, for the right of individual self-determination or sometimes just for the pursuit of happiness. Watching the Schiavo case unfold, most Americans quickly opted for the solution that would end the ordeal.\n        Some people hold religious convictions so heartfelt that they could not bow to public opinion or the courts and accept the conclusion that Ms. Schiavo should be allowed to die. They deserve respect, just as her husband and her other relatives deserve sympathy.\n        Those relatives also deserve to be left alone, to be protected from a spotlight that turned a family tragedy into an international spectacle of sometimes shocking vulgarity and viciousness. The case attracted outsiders in search of little more than another opportunity to further their own self-aggrandizement. But worst of all were the powerful people who looked at the world we live in today, in which politics is about maximizing hysteria at the margins, and concluded that the Schiavo fight was a win-win -- for everyone but the people who actually cared about the dying woman.\n        Today, finally, there is a moment of consensus.

Republican Party lawyers are calling for an 11th-hour purge of voter rolls in a clear effort to help their endangered state senator, Nicholas Spano.\n        Two years ago, Mr. Spano won a race against Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democratic Westchester County legislator, by 18 votes after months of courtroom wrangling and ballot-challenging. This year's rematch has been bitter, full of venomous ads and slung mud. Then last Friday, Republican lawyers filed challenges to nearly 6,000 voter registrations in the Senate district, charging discrepancies between county voter lists and change-of-address records compiled by the Postal Service.\n        There is a process for investigating an accusation of voter fraud. It involves sending a letter to an address in dispute, and possibly following up with a police inquiry. The Westchester County Board of Elections is doing that. But it has never had an outside party dump so many contested names so close to such a fiercely contested election.\n        The Republicans say they have only the purest motives. ''It's in everyone's interest to put the election beyond the pale of fraud,'' said John Ciampoli, a lawyer for the county Republican Party.\n        Forgive us if we are unmoved by this freelance fit of pre-election rectitude. If the Republicans were sincere about tidying the voter rolls, they could have raised the alarm long ago. Instead they dropped a bomb at the last minute -- a conjectural list of possibly problematic names that the Board of Elections has no hope of clearing up before Nov. 7. Efforts to purge voter rolls are notoriously prone to error and misuse, because of the innocent or inconsequential discrepancies that abound in voter records.\n        Whatever happens on Tuesday, this list must not be used to disenfranchise voters. People should go to the polls knowing they will not be intimidated or threatened for trying to vote.\n        Mr. Spano can make a credible case for re-election based on his record. It's regrettable that he belongs to a party that demonstrates an unseemly enthusiasm for keeping people from voting and for turning the exercise of democracy into a game won on technicalities. He should disavow this scheme, call off the lawyers and try to win an open, aboveboard election.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1773449,"ids":1773449,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"One of the most important posts in Connecticut, education commissioner, will soon be vacant. With the departure of Betty Sternberg on Aug. 14, the state should recruit a visionary to succeed her. Connecticut's future lies in the education of its children, and for all the state's wealth, suburban and urban school systems alike face serious problems. This is one of the biggest personnel decisions of Gov. M. Jodi Rell's administration, and she should not be shy about telling the state Board of Education, which will choose the new education chief, what kind of candidate she wants.\n        Dr. Sternberg, who will become the next superintendent of the Greenwich public schools, held the commissioner's job for less than three years. She will be remembered for reorganizing the department from top to bottom and getting into an ill-advised war of words with the federal Department of Education over the No Child Left Behind Act, which she opposed.\n        What should the next commissioner's priorities be? Here are a few suggestions:\n        Address Connecticut's reading crisis. Children who fall behind in reading face huge difficulties catching up. Yet only about 39 percent of Connecticut fourth graders are reading up to national standards, and nearly 30 percent are reading below basic levels, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The state prefers to use its Connecticut Mastery Test scores as its benchmark, but those, too, expose the problem: only 52.8 percent percent of fourth graders read at or above state goal levels.\n        The reading crisis is especially acute among Hispanic and black youth. Fully three-quarters of minority fourth-grade students are below state goal levels in reading.\n        Increase teacher training in reading. Virtually anyone can learn to read, national studies show, but it does not come naturally. One in five American children of all races, income levels and intelligence have substantial difficulty in learning to read. Yet nationwide, fewer than one in 10 teachers knows how to teach such children. Despite this, Connecticut requires teachers to take a bare minimum of two courses in language arts -- which may or may not include reading. Starting July 1, teachers will have to take an additional course in best practices in literacy skills. It is a start, but it is not enough.\n        Improve minority graduation rates. Connecticut has long been proud of its high school graduation rate, at 79 percent one of the highest in the country. So it should be especially ashamed that only half of its Hispanic students graduate, which is below the national average, according to a study by Education Week. Latinos make up one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups in the state, and young Latinos are dropping out at alarming levels. Without diplomas, they will most likely earn lower-than-average wages. The state does somewhat better with black students, 61 percent of whom graduate, above the national average.\n        Stop opposing No Child Left Behind. There may be a lack of federal funding to meet the law's requirements, but the measure does impose an overdue mandate to improve failing schools. Students, many of them members of minorities, have been trapped in these schools for years while school systems pay lip service to making progress. Students cannot afford to wait, and neither can the state.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":18,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1788489,"ids":1788489,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"One of the worst things about listening to those who rushed to ground zero after the attacks on Sept. 11 is that you can barely hear their stories. For many, the lungs hardly work. The cough, the ragged breathing, the confusion and even the bitterness make it hard for some of those who labored in that toxic cloud to explain how they feel forgotten. Like Steven Centore, a former federal worker from Flanders, N.Y., who became so emotional at a Congressional hearing in Manhattan yesterday that he had to be gently reminded of his own condition.\n        Sick from his time working at ground zero, Mr. Centore was forced to pay for his treatment, and the federal government offered only one thing, he said: a ''screening'' that determined he was indeed sick. ''You mean I'm just a data point for you,'' he recalled saying to the nurse filling out his forms.\n        People like Mr. Centore and maybe 40,000 others from across the country must be treated for diseases that become more obvious every week. As Mount Sinai Medical Center reported Tuesday, as many as seven in 10 of those who worked at ground zero and Fresh Kills on Staten Island have felt their lungs deteriorate because of their heroism.\n        What the veterans of Sept. 11 need now is a national response, which is not a strong suit these days in Washington. There are a number of partial efforts to help by city, state, federal and private sources. But somebody has to make sure that those who are suffering don't fall through the many gaps. Recommendations worth considering include putting those without health care under Medicare. The federal government should also restore the Victims Compensation Fund, which originally focused on victims' families and was phased out in 2003. This time the fund should pay for health care of these emergency workers. If something drastic is not done soon, there are lawsuits involving as many as 8,000 people that could end up costing taxpayers a lot more in the long run.\n        For some politicians, the message seems to have gotten through -- especially as the nation remembers the attack five years ago this Monday. Members of Congress from the New York area have been pressuring to get more federal money for these responders. And Michael Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, has promised to create a task force to provide some organization and to figure out the best ways to proceed. Creating a task force sounds like a delay rather than an answer, but the politicians from the Northeast who have been trumpeting this cause should now keep pestering Mr. Leavitt to move quickly.\n        As we pay homage on Monday to those who died on Sept. 11, 2001, it is worth remembering what happened on May 28, 2002. That evening -- a scant 37 weeks after the attack -- workers took down the last column from that smoldering mound and officially cleared the site. As one worker said of the herculean task completed by so many selfless people, ''You found out who you were, what it means to be an American, what it is to stand up.''\n        They came when the nation was attacked.

His appointment yesterday by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to keep an eye on Israeli and Palestinian armed forces is a welcome sign that at long last, America is tiptoeing back into the game in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n        General Ward, the deputy commander of the United States Army in Europe, doesn't come with quite the panache or stature of a Henry Kissinger or a George Mitchell, who have both tried their hands at shuttle diplomacy in Israel and the Palestinian territories. He's not even an Anthony Zinni, the retired marine general who spent a year as the special envoy, making fruitless trips to the region before stepping down in 2003. In fact, General Ward has zero political credentials, long a requirement for making deals in a region where both sides tend to want to talk only to the top-level types they believe can bring home agreements. Yesterday, critics of President Bush's shortsighted hands-off policy in the Middle East peace effort were already characterizing the appointment of General Ward as a ploy to inoculate the president from complaints that America doesn't give a whit about whether the Palestinians ever get their own state.\n        Some, or all, of that may well prove true, especially if Mr. Bush fails to back up General Ward the way he failed to back up General Zinni. But General Ward's tasks are more clearly defined than those of his high-ranking predecessors in the world of Middle East shuttle diplomacy, and he has something that none of them had: the new Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.\n        Mr. Abbas will arrive today at Sharm el Sheik, an Egyptian seaside resort, for what could be a historic meeting with Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon. Unlike Yasir Arafat, who was far more at ease as a fiery revolutionary than as a pragmatic statesman, Mr. Abbas brings with him a realism that has been too long missing in Palestinian affairs of state. If Mr. Abbas continues to speak forcefully against violence, and begins to back those words with action, he could well maneuver Mr. Sharon in a direction that Mr. Arafat couldn't get him to go: toward a real peace deal and a Palestinian state.\n        That's all likely far, far down the road. For now, we applaud General Ward's appointment, and wish him all the best in his appointed task of helping to train and equip Palestinian forces, and to monitor Israeli and Palestinian promises to suspend military actions against each other. And we cross our fingers for an outcome at Sharm el Sheik today that goes beyond just the usual prisoner-release announcements (by the Israelis) and promises to halt useless attacks (by the Palestinians).","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1721283,"ids":1721283,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Patience is a lot to ask from the victims of a bloody tyrant who have waited decades for justice. But patience is exactly what is needed now from the judges in the trial of Saddam Hussein, from Iraqi political leaders and from ordinary Iraqi citizens.\n        The hope is that this trial will mark a crucial watershed in Iraq's passage from a lawless dictatorship to a constitutional government. The fear is that it will degenerate into a sorry spectacle of victor's justice and revenge, turning a monster into a martyr in the eyes of Sunni Arabs throughout Iraq and the Middle East.\n        In the next few weeks, one or the other of these narratives will take shape in the minds of audiences around the world, the most important one being in Iraq. It is crucial that the judges presiding over this emotionally and politically charged case demonstrate the trial's fairness, legitimacy and completeness. That is why it would have been better to start building up a pattern of evidence about Mr. Hussein's system by first trying lower-level officials. And that is why it would now be a mistake to cut off the possibility of further trials for Mr. Hussein by a hasty verdict followed by a hasty execution.\n        The court's highest responsibility is to see to it that this haughty and hateful man and his co-defendants are accorded the human dignity and right to defend themselves that the tyrannical Baathist regime systematically denied to its millions of victims. To do so would declare strength, not weakness, as well as confidence in the set of values around which a new and better Iraq must be built.\n        It would at least give pause to the millions of Arab Sunnis, in Iraq and elsewhere, who seem so receptive to Mr. Hussein's self-portrayal as an Arab nationalist victim of an invading American Army. And it would provide a useful education for Iraq's newly empowered Shiites and Kurds about the morally and politically corrosive consequences of building a regime on ethnic and sectarian stereotyping and jealousies, and of using paramilitary enforcers loyal to individual leaders, not laws.\n        It is becoming clearer with each passing week that such lessons are urgently needed. As American forces try to stand down in Iraqi cities outside the western heartland of the Sunni insurgency, the Iraqi forces that have been standing up in their stead have increasingly been accused of torture and group executions. Some of those implicated work for the new Iraqi Army or Interior Ministry. Others belong either to the fearsome, Iranian-trained Badr Brigade, affiliated with one of the two Shiite ruling parties, or to the Mahdi Army, a private militia run by a charismatic Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr.\n        The evil of Mr. Hussein's system was not simply that Shiites, Kurds and critics were lawlessly persecuted, tortured and murdered by a regime controlled by the Sunni minority. It was that Iraqis of any ethnic or religious group were lawlessly persecuted, tortured and murdered on the basis of their religion, ethnicity or political views.\n        If that kind of lawless behavior takes root again, Saddam Hussein's trial will have accomplished less than it should.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1825538,"ids":1825538,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Peace with Israel was not the subject of the summit meeting Palestinian leaders held in Mecca last week. The Saudi government summoned the leaders of Hamas and Fatah to negotiate a halt in their incipient civil war, which was alarming and embarrassing the Arab world.\n        Still, the vaguely worded agreement, and the creation of a coalition cabinet, might make peace with Israel more imaginable -- if there is a lot more compromise from Hamas and a lot more diplomatic help from Washington.\n        Hamas and Fatah have reached understandings before, only to have them unravel. This deal could prove more durable because of the heavy investment of Saudi diplomatic capital and the dire financial condition of the Palestinian Authority.\n        Before Europe and the United States will release aid to the authority, Hamas must recognize Israel, renounce violence and abide by previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. What Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president and a Fatah leader, managed to extract from Hamas last week was far less -- an agreement merely to respect international agreements and resolutions previously agreed to when Fatah was in charge.\n        That grudging and highly equivocal concession is further than Hamas had gone. It will be parsed in various ways by various interested parties for weeks to come. But what really matters is how Hamas acts. The most important action would be a credible effort by the joint Hamas and Fatah government to detect and thwart terrorist attacks against Israel. Saudi Arabia is reportedly ready to offer the Palestinian government a large aid package. That might help show Hamas the advantages of improved behavior. But Riyadh should make clear that continued aid will require clear proof that the new government is reining in terrorism.\n        Whether Hamas is prepared to take that crucial step is doubtful. Israel and the United States should encourage it by making clear that an all-out effort against terrorism would radically improve the negotiating climate -- and open the aid spigots.\n        Given the current political paralysis in Israel, Washington will have to take the lead in sending this message. That will take more courage than the Bush administration has yet managed to muster. Mr. Bush has wasted more than six years without coming up with a serious policy for reducing violence between Israel and the Palestinians and promoting diplomacy.\n        Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is set to meet with Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and Mr. Abbas a week from tomorrow.

Is there a connection?\n        Of course, says the moralist: these are prime evidence of a late 20th- and early 21st-century outbreak of American self-indulgence. The McMansion pushes out to the edges of its half-acre lot in much the same way an XXL strains the engineering tolerances of a pair of sweatpants. It does to a neighborhood with bricks and mortar what people do to themselves with a fork and a straw.\n        But while both examples of American gigantism have some of the same roots -- public policies, for instance, that encourage great wealth and abundant supplies of high-fructose corn syrup -- they differ in important ways that complicate the arguments of the scornful moral crusader.\n        Take, for instance, the zoning battles in places like Briarcliff Manor, where residents have been bitterly divided over one mayor's efforts to limit the bulk and sheer presence of mega-mansions and his successor's efforts to amend those efforts. These are slippery issues, difficult for outsiders to weigh in on, because the conflict is not about health or safety but about taste, a devilish abstraction.\n        Obesity is an obvious public-health problem. The Hummer is relevant to any number of policy debates, from traffic safety to fossil-fuel dependence to the fate of the warming globe. But the McMansion, comparatively speaking, is a lesser, or at least far subtler, abomination.\n        Mighty contests rise from trivial things, of course, and you cannot read the letters we get on the Briarcliff Manor issue without being struck by its ability to send people into paroxysms. And the problem is not limited to the New York suburbs. Communities around the country are becoming stricter about lot sizes, density and setback requirements to keep neighborhoods from being overwhelmed by residential supersizing.\n        They are struggling against an implacable foe. If there is a natural limit to human grandiosity beyond which people, at least many people, will not go, that limit has never been found. In a visit by ''60 Minutes'' to the world of McMansions last year, Morley Safer marveled at the ways the perception of what was considered an ''ordinary'' house had been dialed up, up, up in recent years, past 3,000 square feet to 6,000, 8,000 and 10,000 square feet or more.\n        It is the arms race all over again, and all the gypsum mines in the world must be working around the clock to keep the upwardly mobile supplied in Sheetrock. People who find this intolerable -- as do those in Briarcliff Manor who have struggled to resist what they believe to be an assault on their village's character by a system stacked in favor of developers -- can console themselves in small ways.\n        They may have to look at McMansions. But they do not have to live in them, or lie awake nights worrying about raccoons in the turrets. And they benefit from a valuable public service supplied by the strivers in their faux chateaus who, by exercising such dubious judgment in such a visible way, allow everyone around them to reaffirm their belief in their own modesty, thrift and good taste.\n        In the suburbs, disdaining your neighbors is as commonplace as envying them, and can be twice the fun.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1779412,"ids":1779412,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Politicians will soon be swarming over potential voters like the last gnats of summer.

They fall sick or get hurt doing jobs that are strenuous and unsafe. In January, an Ecuadoran immigrant, the father of six, was killed at a recycling plant in West Babylon, N.Y., when his son accidentally ran over him with a payloader. On a freezing night in February, a young Honduran man went to sleep, drunk, in a tent in some woods near the Long Island Rail Road tracks and never woke up.\n        The cause of death in each case was reasonably clear-cut, and the general reaction -- a sad shrug and a return to other business -- was predictable.\n        The death last month of Rene Javier Perez, a Guatemalan immigrant, was different. It was ruled a homicide, and it followed an as-yet-unexplained series of events that involved police officers in Mount Kisco and Bedford. The case deserves close and aggressive scrutiny, as any homicide should, but particularly because of the questions and anguish it has provoked in a community where tensions run high between Hispanic newcomers and the rich, mostly white neighbors they live among and serve.\n        Mr. Perez, age 42 and homeless, was a troubled man who drank too much and had frequent run-ins with the police. On the night he died, according to news reports, he had caused a disturbance at a retail store in Bedford, been driven by Bedford police officers into Mount Kisco, and then called 911 from a coin laundry there, for reasons unclear -- his speech was slurred and the operator could not understand him. He was questioned by three Mount Kisco police officers who left soon after the encounter, apparently having concluded that this ''was not a police matter,'' according to a dispatcher's notes. About an hour later, shortly before midnight, Mr. Perez was found six miles away, lying beside a road in Bedford, bleeding to death from abdominal injuries.\n        The questions of who beat him and how he ended up in Bedford had not been answered last week. The good news so far is that attention is being paid. Surveillance tapes are being reviewed, news conferences have been held, the interest from the community and media has been high enough to maintain pressure for a thorough investigation.\n        The homicide has also led Bedford's small police department to investigate its counterpart in Mount Kisco, showing what appears to be the proper initiative in impounding two Mount Kisco patrol cars, seizing security tapes and enlisting help from state investigators and the county district attorney's office. The Mount Kisco police should respond to this investigation with full cooperation and utter transparency.\n        The combined efforts of state, county and village authorities may prove adequate in solving this crime, but in a community shaken by violence before -- there have been two other unsolved killings of Guatemalan men in the last four years -- they may not be enough to ease fears and instill confidence in law enforcement. Advocacy groups have already called for a federal investigation into Mr. Perez's death. This seems premature, but if the case is not solved soon, it will clearly be time to bring in more resources, looking diligently into what cut short not just one but three men's lives.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1837979,"ids":1837979,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush and his advisers have made a lot of ridiculous charges about critics of the war in Iraq: they're unpatriotic, they want the terrorists to win, they don't support the troops, to cite just a few. But none of these seem quite as absurd as President Bush's latest suggestion, that critics of the war whose children are at risk are too ''emotional'' to see things clearly.\n        The direct target was Matthew Dowd, one of the chief strategists of Mr. Bush's 2004 presidential campaign, who has grown disillusioned with the president and the war, which he made clear in an interview with Jim Rutenberg published in The Times last Sunday. But by extension, Mr. Bush's comments were insulting to the hundreds of thousands of Americans whose sons, daughters, sisters, brothers and spouses have served or will serve in Iraq.\n        They are perfectly capable of forming judgments about the war, pro or con, on the merits. But when Mr. Bush was asked about Mr. Dowd during a Rose Garden news conference yesterday, he said, ''This is an emotional issue for Matthew, as it is for a lot of other people in our country.''\n        Mr. Dowd's case, Mr. Bush said, ''as I understand it, is obviously intensified because his son is deployable.''\n        Over the weekend, two of Mr. Bush's chief spokesmen, Dan Bartlett and Dana Perino, claimed that Mr. Dowd's change of heart about the war was rooted in ''personal'' issues and ''emotions,'' and talked of his ''personal journey.'' In recent years, Mr. Dowd suffered the death of a premature twin daughter, and was divorced. His son is scheduled to serve in Iraq soon.\n        Mr. Dowd said his experiences were a backdrop to his reconsideration of his support of the war and Mr. Bush. There is nothing wrong with that, but there is something deeply wrong with the White House's dismissing his criticism as emotional, as if it has no reasoned connection to Mr. Bush's policies.\n        This form of attack is especially galling from a president who from the start tried to paint this war as virtually sacrifice-free: the Iraqis would welcome America with open arms, the war would be paid for with Iraqi oil revenues -- and the all-volunteer military would concentrate the sacrifice on only a portion of the nation's families.\n        Mr. Bush's comments about Mr. Dowd are a reflection of the otherworldliness that permeates his public appearances these days. Mr. Bush seems increasingly isolated, clinging to a fantasy version of Iraq that is more and more disconnected from reality. He gives a frightening impression that he has never heard any voice from any quarter that gave him pause, much less led him to rethink a position.\n        Mr. Bush's former campaign aide showed an open-mindedness and willingness to adapt to reality that is sorely lacking in the commander in chief.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1824626,"ids":1824626,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"President Bush claims that his new $2.9 trillion budget request is a tough-minded plan for balancing the books by 2012. In reality, it's a smokescreen for making Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent -- and either hollowing out the government in the process or digging the country deeper into debt.\n        The budget is based on a series of improbable, if not dishonest, assumptions. To make it appear as if the tax cuts are affordable in the near term, it assumes that the Pentagon will not spend a single penny on Iraq or Afghanistan after 2009. It also assumes there will be no costs for fixing the alternative minimum tax after this year, even though Mr. Bush and virtually every politician in America is committed to such relief.\n        The new budget would also slash key entitlement programs and punish many of the country's most vulnerable citizens. Sharp reductions are envisioned for Medicare, with cuts of $66 billion over five years, and Medicaid, down approximately $11 billion. Some of the Medicare proposals could serve as useful starting points for a debate on controlling costs through such steps as raising premiums for high-income beneficiaries. But the Medicaid cuts would be largely counterproductive. At a time when the number of uninsured children is rising, the cuts would force many states to reduce their Medicaid rolls.\n        Mr. Bush's budget would also take an ax to most other domestic spending. One program that would be gone entirely in 2008 provides monthly bags of groceries, each worth less than $20, to 440,000 needy elderly people. The $99 million block grant to states to help pay for preventive health care would also be eliminated. Other cuts -- in Head Start, veterans' health care, environmental protection, scientific research, low-income housing and heating assistance, to name a few -- would start in 2008 and grow, totaling $114 billion over five years. Such cuts would be shortsighted and cruel. They would also be politically impossible to enact -- further exposing Mr. Bush's budget as the sham it is.\n        Even if they were achievable, the proposed spending reductions would be grossly unfair. Government programs that serve middle-class and low-income Americans would be slashed to offset the cost of extending tax cuts that favor the rich. In 2012 alone, the president's new budget would cut domestic discretionary spending by $34 billion, while tax cuts for households with incomes above $1 million would total $73 billion. In all, by 2012, 20 percent of the tax cuts would go to that richest sliver of Americans; one-third of the benefits would go to households with incomes over $400,000.\n        Mr. Bush's new budget has a few worthwhile nuggets, like a proposed increase in Pell grants for low-income college students and a jump in the funds for AIDS treatment worldwide. In drafting a real budget, Congress can take those items from the president's version, and jettison the rest.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1761247,"ids":1761247,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush deserves much credit for sharply increasing United States financing for AIDS prevention programs overseas. But along with Congress, he must also shoulder the blame for letting ideology rather than sound public health policy drive how the money is spent.\n        The elevation of ideology over both science and local needs is deadly in this case. A new report by the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, finds that efforts to stem the AIDS pandemic are being undermined by the insistence of Republican Congressional leaders and the administration that an unduly large portion of the funds be used to emphasize sexual abstinence and fidelity.\n        Based on candid and confidential in-depth interviews with American officials carrying out AIDS prevention programs financed by the United States in 15 countries, the G.A.O.'s assessment should weigh heavily on the president's conscience, and inspire a change of policy.\n        Because of a very bad amendment tagged onto the law financing global AIDS efforts, fully 33 percent of prevention funds must be used for abstinence-until-marriage and fidelity programs. That drastically limits the money and flexibility for broader, proven strategies to combat AIDS, including the condom part of the so-called ABC approach: abstain, be faithful or use condoms.\n        Apart from ignoring human nature, the stress on abstinence largely ignores the situation in countries like India or Russia, which have exploding H.I.V. and AIDS problems stemming largely from the intravenous use of illegal drugs and prostitution. The administration has added rules that effectively raise the spending for abstinence-only programs in some countries to well in excess of 33 percent.\n        The result, according to the G.A.O. review, is abstinence overkill, with some countries having to cut spending on effective prevention strategies, including programs to prevent the transmission of H.I.V. from infected mothers to their newborn infants. That is indefensible.\n        With no intervention, a pregnant woman with H.I.V. stands a large chance of infecting her infant at birth or during breast-feeding -- a possible death sentence because, without treatment, some 60 percent of infected children die by their third birthdays. The experience in developing countries is that inexpensive treatment with antiretroviral drugs can reduce the risk of transmission by up to half.\n        While promoting abstinence and faithfulness is important, de-emphasizing effective programs that involve condoms, as the administration has been doing, is a dangerous strategy.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1684103,"ids":1684103,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"President Bush did all Americans a service on Wednesday by ordering reforms that offer the real possibility of plugging the national security holes that allowed the 9\/11 hijackers to plan, train for and carry out mass murder without being noticed. They are a rebuff to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's attempts to seize control of intelligence gathering. And they give real power to the new director of national intelligence, John Negroponte.\n        Mr. Bush adopted almost all of the 74 recommendations made by a commission he had asked to review the bungling of intelligence on Saddam Hussein's weapons. The panel held no policy makers accountable for the W.M.D. disaster, but it did offer wise advise on how to improve the ability of the F.B.I., the Justice Department and the C.I.A. to thwart terrorist plots, share information and control weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Bush completely rejected only one idea, and he appears to be right in doing that. The details were classified, but Douglas Jehl reported in The Times that the axed proposal would have given the Pentagon greater authority to conduct covert operations.\n        Mr. Bush has authorized the creation of a National Security Service within the Federal Bureau of Investigation that will combine all of the units charged with the discovery, investigation and disruption of terrorist plots. Mr. Negroponte will have the power to approve the choice of director and to set the service's priorities. The Justice Department will also combine three offices handling intelligence and terrorism into one office, run by a new assistant attorney general who will be guided by Mr. Negroponte.\n        The new domestic security service has the potential to fix some of the things that left the F.B.I. blind to the 9\/11 plot: agents investigating criminal cases were walled off from agents handling domestic intelligence, field offices did not communicate or share information, and the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. barely talked. Those practices weren't all irrational: keeping the C.I.A. out of domestic investigations was a reaction to major abuses of civil liberties, as was separating intelligence gathering from law enforcement at the F.B.I., which once abused those powers to persecute supposed communist sympathizers, civil rights activists and others. But 9\/11 showed that those practices needed to be reformed.\n        The terror attacks made it clear that the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. could not counter new threats from terrorists who have grown ever smarter, richer and more organized. But concerns about civil liberties can't be ignored. Ideally, the changes will make the F.B.I. more effective, and imbue the domestic operations of the C.I.A., which was designed to operate covertly outside the law in other nations, with the principles of due process and the rule of law.\n        We wish the president had followed the 9\/11 panel's idea of creating a review board with real authority to safeguard civil liberties. Instead, Congress created a toothless panel whose members have not even been seated, which leaves Americans trusting the good intentions of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who has a dismal record on the proper limits of government power, and Mr. Negroponte, who is known for his ability to adapt to whatever administration he is serving.\n        Still, Mr. Bush is trying to address threats that will outlast any administration or particular official, and the reforms he unveiled this week should put national security on a better, smarter track.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1851284,"ids":1851284,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush has been feeling the heat on global warming. He's been feeling it from Congress, from state governors, from the business community and, most recently and powerfully, from America's closest foreign allies, who are fed up with his passivity on the issue and desperate for him to show some real leadership.\n        So yesterday Mr. Bush stepped before the microphones in Washington to announce that he would help convene a series of meetings beginning this fall of the worlds' 15 biggest emitters of greenhouse gases (the United States is No. 1) to develop a long-term ''global strategy'' for dealing with climate change. He offered no details beyond the general hope that the nations involved would voluntarily establish ''midterm national targets'' and would increase their investments in new and cleaner technologies.\n        Given Mr. Bush's history of denial and obstructionism when it comes to climate change, there are good reasons to be cynical about this sudden enthusiasm, coming as it does on the eve of the meeting of the Group of 8 industrialized nations.\n        Most of these nations -- and in particular the meeting's host, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany -- were deeply offended by the administration's rude rejection of Mrs. Merkel's proposal for deep, mandatory cuts in emissions by midcentury. Cuts of up to 80 percent by 2050 have been recommended by many of the world's top scientists as necessary to avert the worst consequences of climate change.\n        Mr. Bush gave no indication that he is any more sympathetic to Mrs. Merkel's ideas than he was a week ago. Indeed, his spokesmen made clear that he remains as hostile as ever to most of the mechanisms associated with the 1997 Kyoto accord, which included a firm if modest cap on emissions. Many European leaders are still bristling over Condoleezza Rice's 2001 declaration that the treaty was ''dead on arrival.''\n        As rhetoric, some of what Mr. Bush had to say was different and heartening. He acknowledged the need for real reductions in greenhouse gases, as opposed to his earlier strategy of allowing increases in emissions as long as they did not exceed the rate of economic growth. He said he found the scientific evidence of a link between climate change and human activity to be increasingly persuasive. He agreed that big developing nations like China and India absolutely had to be part of the solution.\n        Yet he remains convinced that technology holds most of the answers and that the regulatory restraints that many experts regard as a necessary condition of technological progress are largely unnecessary. He says further that his goal is to produce a common strategy in 18 months. This would coincide, roughly speaking, with his departure from public life, suggesting his real goal is to leave the heavy lifting to his successor.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":6,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1680131,"ids":1680131,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush has been running from the issue of global warming for four years, but the walls are closing in. Scientists throughout the world are telling him that the rise in atmospheric temperature justifies aggressive action. Arnold Schwarzenegger and other prominent Republicans are telling him to get off the dime. His corporate allies are deserting him. And the Senate is inching closer to endorsing a mandatory cap on greenhouse gas emissions.\n        A result is that Mr. Bush seems increasingly isolated and his rhetoric of denial increasingly irrational. Last week, a whistleblower asserted that a senior White House official, formerly an oil lobbyist, had changed scientific reports to minimize the climate problem. The official, Philip Cooney, resigned last Friday, although the White House insisted that the embarrassing disclosures had nothing to do with his departure. Whatever the truth, this was hardly the first time Bush officials cooked the books for political ends. It was just this kind of nonsense that persuaded an exasperated Christie Whitman to return to private life.\n        Out in the real world, hardly anyone denies the importance of the issue anymore. Just over a week ago, Mr. Schwarzenegger pledged to slow, stop and ultimately reverse California's greenhouse gas emissions by requiring big improvements in automobile efficiency and pushing for energy sources other than fossil fuels. ''The debate is over,'' the governor said. ''We know the science, we see the threat, and we know the time for action is now.''\n        As if on cue, the National Academy of Sciences and 10 of its counterparts around the world declared that the science of global warming is clear enough to warrant prompt reductions in greenhouse gases. Mainstream scientists have long accepted the link between warming and human activity. What made this statement exceptional was its tone and its timing, coming a month before Mr. Bush and other leaders from the Group of 8 industrialized nations are to meet in Gleneagles, Scotland, where Prime Minister Tony Blair will put climate change near the top of the agenda.\n        As things stand now, Mr. Bush will be going to that meeting empty-handed, despite Mr. Blair's efforts last week to make him take the issue more seriously. Perhaps the Senate can give him something positive to point to, although it will have to act fast. Three different global warming proposals requiring mandatory controls on carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas, could surface as amendments during the forthcoming debate on the energy bill, scheduled to begin in earnest this week.\n        One of these, the McCain-Lieberman bill, received a surprising 43 votes in October 2003. That was before the rest of the world began moving toward mandatory controls and before American power companies began to slowly accept that such controls were not only inevitable but also necessary to spur the development of more efficient ways of producing energy.\n        The results could be better this time. There is speculation that a less ambitious but also less costly bill sponsored by Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, and modeled after proposals from the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy, could win a filibuster-proof 60 votes. That may be a long shot. But what is clear is that the warming issue is gaining traction at home and abroad, inspired partly by Mr. Bush's incorrigible stubbornness.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":18,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1796012,"ids":1796012,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush has described today's Iraq as a ''young democracy.'' He even boasted at one point that the advance of democratic institutions in Iraq is ''setting an example'' that others in the area would be ''wise to follow.'' But when it comes to one of the most basic tenets of democracy -- freedom of speech and the press -- Iraq is not setting an example that even the youngest of democracies would be wise to follow.\n        New laws in Iraq criminalize speech that ridicules the government or its officials, and any journalist who ''publicly insults'' the government or public officials can be subject to up to seven years in prison. Some of the language is resurrected verbatim from Saddam Hussein's own penal code. It is hard enough for journalists to operate on the ever-expanding battlefields of Iraq. That is true for foreign journalists, who often have all the gear and protections of powerful outside media. But it is even harder for Iraqi journalists, who now face not only the dangers on the street but the threat of defamation laws as well.\n        More than 130 journalists or other employees of news outlets have been killed in this war, most of them Iraqis. Some died accidentally, of course. But too many working journalists have clearly been targeted, some even brutally tortured to death, precisely because of what they were publishing. On one day last August, a newspaper editor and a prominent columnist were both shot to death by gunmen in different sections of Baghdad.\n        The Committee to Protect Journalists has been tracking an increasing number of journalists whose critical voices are being muted or silenced in other ways. In the last year, about a dozen Iraqi journalists have been formally accused of offending public officials -- a charge that can bring a fine or prison term or both. In one case, a high school teacher was arrested after he wrote in a small paper that the two party leaders in his area were acting like pharaohs.\n        Other journalists were arrested for writing about a top official's dispute over a telephone bill. A woman reporter was charged with defamation when she quoted a protester comparing today's police with those of Saddam Hussein.\n        Three journalists for a small newspaper in the southern city of Kut could go to prison for 10 years and pay heavy fines for a number of articles on local corruption. One article compared Iraqi's present judicial system with that of the Hussein regime; another reprinted Washington Post charges of corruption in the Iraqi police force.\n        After suffering under grinding repression, Iraqi journalists began enjoying more freedom to report after Saddam Hussein was ousted. Now the country is moving backward with efforts to shut down television offices and jail journalists who criticize public officials. Surely any crackdown on freedom of speech and the press is not what the American people had in mind when the Iraq invasion began.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1715766,"ids":1715766,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush has long argued that a nationwide program of mandatory controls on carbon dioxide and other global warming gases would saddle the country with crippling electricity costs. He may be surprised to learn that his own Environmental Protection Agency no longer believes that to be the case.\n        In the course of a study comparing costs and benefits of various clean air bills rattling around Capitol Hill (including Mr. Bush's Clear Skies program), the E.P.A. found that under a measure sponsored by Senator Thomas Carper, a Delaware Democrat, the cost to electric utilities of controlling carbon dioxide would be only $1 per ton, imposing little burden on consumers and business.\n        To be sure, Mr. Carper's is the least aggressive and least expensive of the bills requiring mandatory controls. It applies only to power plants, which account for about one-third of carbon dioxide emissions, and would not regulate emissions from cars and others sources.\n        Still, that measly $1-per-ton figure should embarrass the Bush people who've been warning that controls will bring economic ruin (Clear Skies regulates other pollutants but not carbon dioxide), while providing encouragement to those in Congress who believe that action on warming is long overdue.\n        Not that there's any shortage of incentives. A recent series in The Times provided fresh evidence that there is already so much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that the Arctic, where the sea ice has been steadily disappearing, may have passed ''the point of no return.'' But the series also said there's still time to avert catastrophic consequences, like the melting of the Greenland ice cap.\n        Meanwhile, Mr. Bush's staunch and patient friend, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, has once again -- this time in The Observer -- appealed to the president to join in a global effort to limit greenhouse gases. Without American participation, Mr. Blair suggests, there's little hope of securing the cooperation of the Chinese, who are building coal-fired power plants at a rapid clip and whose future emissions could overwhelm Western efforts to get a grip on the problem.\n        Add in the fact that 2005 is almost certain to be the hottest year on record (continuing a 25-year trend of rising global temperatures); add also what Mr. Blair calls ''vicious climate disasters,'' including stronger hurricanes, and the stage would seem to be set for serious debate.\n        Last summer, the Senate approved a nonbinding resolution that put it on record for the first time as favoring a program of mandatory controls on global warming gases. New Mexico's Pete Domenici -- a recent convert to the global warming cause and a Republican leader on energy issues -- vowed to follow up by seeking consensus legislation.\n        Mr. Domenici should make this an early order of business in the new year, not least because he alone may have the credibility to shake Mr. Bush's indifference.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1840973,"ids":1840973,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush has reneged on his promises to Katrina's victims. Shamefully, the president has chosen the interests of bureaucracy over those of American towns on the brink of failure.\n        Over a year and a half later, there are 64,000 people still sleeping in trailers in Louisiana and far too many communities without schools, hospitals and other basics. These are unacceptable failures. At least part of the problem is a law that requires states to contribute 10 percent of the cost of most federally financed reconstruction projects. Mr. Bush waived that requirement after the Sept. 11 attacks (as his father did after Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki) but he refuses to do so for the Gulf Coast.\n        A law written to deal with isolated tornadoes does not fit the total devastation of an entire region, and particularly the drowning of a major city like New Orleans. But municipalities are still being asked to pony up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, even when they are broke.\n        Louisiana has tried to ease the problem by covering the local share out of a separate pot of money (from Housing and Urban Development block grants) only to find the conflicting demands of the two federal bureaucracies nearly insurmountable.\n        In Louisiana, this bureaucratic nightmare has left the financing for roughly 20,000 projects in limbo, while generating 2.6 million documents and the attendant overhead costs. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, both the House and the Senate have passed versions of the cost-sharing waiver, but they are attached to the spending bill for Iraq, which President Bush has vowed to veto if it includes a deadline for a troop withdrawal. The administration also argues that Congress has already committed over $110 billion for Gulf Coast relief and reconstruction.\n        That is certainly a large sum. But so much money was spent on immediate needs, like housing victims in hotels, that only a relatively small share was left for rebuilding the shattered coastal areas across five states. The State of Louisiana estimates the gap between the devastation there and the federal and private payouts at $34 billion.\n        It is particularly unfortunate because New Orleans -- where the failure of the federally built levee system led to the most damage and suffering -- has finally come up with a limited, practicable rebuilding program that requires the waiver. Led by a respected disaster recovery expert, Edward Blakely, the $1.1 billion plan focuses on 17 areas for rebuilding, including the city's historic centers, old markets and key traffic junctures.\n        The city says it will finance its plan mostly through a pair of bond issues and partly with federal funds. Even then it expects to come up $324 million short. New Orleans could get the money from the state -- if the matching requirement were waived. Those state funds are currently waiting to be used to cover the 10 percent share of those 20,000 projects.\n        In a lofty speech soon after Katrina, Mr. Bush vowed that ''we will do what it takes'' to rebuild the damaged communities. He did not say, ''Unless easily waived regulatory restrictions prohibit us.''","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1678664,"ids":1678664,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"President Bush kept a remarkably straight face yesterday when he strode to the microphones with Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, and told the world that the United States would now get around to spending $674 million in emergency aid that Congress had already approved for needy countries. That's it. Not a penny more to buy treated mosquito nets to help save the thousands of children in Sierra Leone who die every year of preventable malaria. Nothing more to train and pay teachers so 11-year-old girls in Kenya may go to school. And not a cent more to help Ghana develop the programs it needs to get legions of young boys off the streets.\n        Mr. Blair, who will be the host when the G-8, the club of eight leading economic powers, holds its annual meeting next month, is trying to line up pledges to double overall aid for Africa over the next 10 years. That extra $25 billion a year would do all those things, and much more, to raise the continent from dire poverty. Before getting to Washington, Mr. Blair had done very well, securing pledges of large increases from European Union members.\n        According to a poll, most Americans believe that the United States spends 24 percent of its budget on aid to poor countries; it actually spends well under a quarter of 1 percent. As Jeffrey Sachs, the Columbia University economist in charge of the United Nations' Millennium Project, put it so well, the notion that there is a flood of American aid going to Africa ''is one of our great national myths.''\n        The United States currently gives just 0.16 percent of its national income to help poor countries, despite signing a United Nations declaration three years ago in which rich countries agreed to increase their aid to 0.7 percent by 2015. Since then, Britain, France and Germany have all announced plans for how to get to 0.7 percent; America has not. The piddling amount Mr. Bush announced yesterday is not even 0.007 percent.\n        What is 0.7 percent of the American economy? About $80 billion. That is about the amount the Senate just approved for additional military spending, mostly in Iraq. It's not remotely close to the $140 billion corporate tax cut last year.\n        This should not be the image Mr. Bush wants to project around a world that is intently watching American actions on this issue. At a time when rich countries are mounting a noble and worthy effort to make poverty history, the Bush administration is showing itself to be completely out of touch by offering such a miserly drop in the bucket. It's no surprise that Mr. Bush's offer was greeted with scorn in television broadcasts and newspaper headlines around the world. ''Bush Opposes U.K. Africa Debt Plan,'' blared the headline on the AllAfrica news service, based in Johannesburg. ''Blair's Gambit: Shame Bush Into Paying,'' chimed in The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia.\n        The American people have a great heart.

So we welcome the House of Representatives' long-overdue attempt to shake some sense into Mr. Bush with a resolution opposing his decision to send another 20,000 combat troops to fight this disastrous war without any plan to end it.\n        Yet yesterday's vote, in which 17 Republicans joined the Democrats to produce a margin of 246 to 182, was the easy part. It takes no great courage or creativity for a politician to express continuing support for the troops and opposition to a vastly unpopular and unpromising military escalation. Even if the Senate manages to overcome its procedural self-hobbling and approve a similar resolution, the war and the mismanagement will go on.\n        The next necessary steps will require harder thinking and harder choices. Congress needs to do what Mr. Bush is refusing to do: link further financing for the war to the performance of Iraq's Shiite-led government, which is making no serious effort to rescue its country from civil war.\n        Congress needs to impose clear benchmarks and rigorous timetables, insisting that the Iraqi government stop equivocating and start disarming sectarian militias, adopt a formula to share oil revenues equitably and end employment discrimination against Sunni Arabs. Congress must be prepared to cut off financing if the Iraqis refuse.\n        We fear that clever maneuvers like the one proposed by Representative John Murtha, reportedly with the backing of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to dress up a reduction in troop strength as a ''support the troops'' measure won't help contain the war or make American troops safer. Mr. Murtha would link this year's war financing to the Pentagon's adoption of new deployment rules, including longer stretches from the battlefield for returning troops, more specialized training and better defensive equipment. That would let representatives cast a politically safe vote for financing the war, while forcing the Pentagon to gradually reduce the number of active-duty troops available to serve in Iraq.\n        This page has advocated many of the same reforms -- but not as a back-door way of forcing lower troop numbers in Iraq. Congress's overriding goal must be to find the most responsible way to extricate American troops from what is becoming an increasingly unwinnable war, while trying to contain the suffering and minimizing the damage to American interests in the region.\n        Instead of camouflaged troop squeezes, Congress needs to grasp the problem straight on and do what the administration won't do. It must impose tough requirements and deadlines on the Iraqi government, and link the future of all American troops in Iraq to the timely achievement of these goals.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1661595,"ids":1661595,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush made the troubled national parks system the centerpiece of his rather modest environmental agenda during the 2000 campaign, chastising the Democrats for allowing the parks to decay and pledging to spend $1 billion a year in new money over five years to eliminate a backlog of repairs, then estimated at $4.9 billion.\n        It seemed an easy enough promise at the time, but Mr. Bush would dearly love to have it back now. Just two weeks ago, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service pegged the probable backlog at half again that amount, and administration officials -- most recently, Fran Mainella, the beleaguered National Park Service director -- have been forced to concede that the best Mr. Bush can do is to ''address'' the backlog.\n        Yet to dwell exclusively on Mr. Bush's failed promise is diversionary. It is true that he has provided, at best, $900 million or so in new money, and that any other claims made on his behalf involve highly creative accounting. But it is also true that presidents before him, with the possible exception of Dwight Eisenhower, have been no more attentive to park needs, and that Congress has been even worse.\n        Over the past quarter-century, Congress has added more than 80 parks to the system, which now has 388 altogether. Some of these are valid historical sites, while others are pork-barrel parks, shoehorned into the system to enhance the careers of their Congressional sponsors. But they all require upkeep, and Congress, while gradually increasing outlays over the years, has provided nowhere near enough money to do the job.\n        The result is that hardly any part of the system is trouble-free. Many of the 25,000 or so historic buildings are falling apart, roads and bridges need repairs, and sewer systems are wearing out. And still the visitors keep coming, nearly 300 million last year, adding further stress to the system.\n        It is obviously time to get a fix on how bad the problem really is. Mr. Bush's 2006 budget boasts of a new ''comprehensive asset management strategy'' that has enabled the parks department for the first time to ''inventory its assets and measure the condition of its facilities.'' Yet the study remains under wraps, so one concerned congressman, Mark Souder, an Indiana Republican, has begun an inventory of his own.\n        Mr. Souder plans eight to 10 hearings around the country in the next two years to investigate the true state of the parks. The White House is thought to be nervous about these hearings, but Mr. Souder's purpose is not to embarrass Mr. Bush; he has been a Bush loyalist on most issues. He is also, however, devoted to the parks and to the philosophy of stewardship that underlies them, and he is deeply troubled about their future.\n        Mr. Souder's bona fides on this issue are further underscored by the fact that he is co-sponsoring an adventurous bipartisan bill recently introduced in the House that would try to raise serious money for the parks by, among other things, providing a voluntary checkoff device for taxpayers on their returns. The purpose is to put the system on a solid footing by the park service's 100th birthday in 2016, to finance long-neglected cultural and educational needs, to better protect nature and, yes, to eliminate the backlog -- with real money, not mirrors.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1658390,"ids":1658390,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush perhaps unwittingly started the competition for stem cell research in the states when he strictly limited any stem cell work that could be financed by the federal government.

Legislators should consider other avenues as well, even New York's own tax on elective cosmetic surgery -- a field that seems to grow richer with every baby-boomer wrinkle.\n        Nobody knows whether stem cells will eventually cure diabetes or liberate injured people from their wheelchairs. But that is the hope of those like Dr. Mark Noble, professor of biomedical genetics at the University of Rochester Medical Center. During a recent visit to Albany, Dr. Noble predicted that the stem cell revolution could rank with medical advances like vaccinations and antibiotics. And he warned that top New York researchers were already eyeing greener offers in other states.\n        Albany obviously wants to avoid a brain drain, and research in this promising field should be encouraged. But legislators should be wary of asking taxpayers to pay for it.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1674802,"ids":1674802,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush said the other day that the world should see his administration's handling of the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison as a model of transparency and accountability. He said those responsible were being systematically punished, regardless of rank. It made for a nice Oval Office photo-op on a Friday morning. Unfortunately, none of it is true.\n        The administration has provided nothing remotely like a full and honest accounting of the extent of the abuses at American prison camps in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. It has withheld internal reports and stonewalled external inquiries, while clinging to the fiction that the abuse was confined to isolated acts, like the sadistic behavior of one night crew in one cellblock at Abu Ghraib. The administration has prevented any serious investigation of policy makers at the White House, the Justice Department and the Pentagon by orchestrating official probes so that none could come even close to the central question of how the prison policies were formulated and how they led to the abuses.\n        But a two-part series in The Times by Tim Golden provides a horrifying new confirmation that what happened at Abu Ghraib was no aberration, but part of a widespread pattern. It showed the tragic impact of the initial decision by Mr. Bush and his top advisers that they were not going to follow the Geneva Conventions, or indeed American law, for prisoners taken in antiterrorist operations.\n        The series details the killing of two Afghan prisoners at the Bagram prison camp, one of them an innocent taxi driver who was tormented to death by American soldiers. The investigative file on Bagram, obtained by The Times, showed that the mistreatment of prisoners was routine: shackling them to the ceilings of their cells, depriving them of sleep, kicking and hitting them, sexually humiliating them and threatening them with guard dogs -- the very same behavior later repeated in Iraq.\n        This pattern should not surprise anyone by now. The same general who organized the harsh interrogation techniques at Guant\u00e1namo Bay was later sent to Iraq, as were some of the prison guard units from Bagram. Guards at the Iraq and Afghanistan prisons were sent to their duties from civilian life, with no experience and little training.\n        One thing they were taught at Bagram was the ''common peroneal strike'' -- a blow to the side of the leg just above the knee that can cause severe damage. It is clearly out of bounds for a civilized army, but it was used at Bagram routinely. The taxi driver, Dilawar, died after ''blunt force injuries to the lower extremities'' stopped his heart, according to the autopsy report.\n        The trouble is, normal bounds did not apply at Bagram, because the president had muddied the water with conflicting orders. In a February 2002 memo, he spoke of giving prisoners humane treatment, but only when it suited ''military necessity,'' and he also said members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban were not entitled to prisoner-of-war status. That led interrogators to believe that they ''could deviate slightly from the rules,'' according to an Army Reserve sergeant who served at Bagram.\n        It now appears that those slight deviations included killing prisoners, and then covering up the reason they died.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1722640,"ids":1722640,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush went to the nation's Southwest border states recently to talk tough about keeping out illegal immigrants. His rhetoric was hard as he warned of murderers, child molesters and other criminals slipping onto American soil. Gone was the gentler voice of the former Texas governor who talked about how people were coming to America to feed their children, about how ''Family Values Don't Stop at the Rio Grande.'' As a result, many who listened figured that he'd ''tacked right,'' as some Democrats complained, or that he had simply deserted his five-year-old plan for a comprehensive immigration program. A careful reading of the president's comments raises hopes that Mr. Bush is staying his course but selling it a little differently.\n        The president's timing in pushing for immigration reform is crucial. After five years of delay, Congress is finally poised to deal with the growing immigration mess in this country. Some powerful House members have been looking at the problem in less than helpful ways, including draconian -- and impractical -- proposals to build a fence around America or to round up the 11 million illegal immigrants and forcibly send them back where they came from. The best hope so far comes from the Senate, where thoughtful members are looking at variations on Mr. Bush's comprehensive immigration reform. And the best of those so far is a bipartisan package from Senators John McCain and Edward Kennedy that promises security at the borders and a guest worker program that gives the worker some hope of eventual citizenship.\n        The president was not clear last week, but he apparently wants some variation on the McCain-Kennedy proposal -- perhaps with more emphasis on border security and a stronger crackdown on employers using illegal immigrant workers. In Arizona, Mr. Bush said he wanted a guest worker program that would ''bring workers from out of the shadows,'' but he also wanted to ''reject amnesty.'' That reflects one of the least practical parts of the present White House proposal, which calls for all these guest workers to go home after six years. Getting illegal immigrants to sign up for a guest worker program that forces a return home in six years will be one tough sell. It would be far better to offer a path -- even a difficult path -- to full citizenship.\n        Not long ago, the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, got a surprise when it polled a number of likely Republican voters on this emotional issue. Most of those polled said they wanted immigration reform that would work. They did not favor an approach that focused on enforcement only, perhaps recognizing that a string of enforcement provisions over the last few years has done little to stop the flood of illegal immigrants. In short, some three-quarters of these likely Republican voters favored a comprehensive immigration plan much like the McCain-Kennedy package. If that many Republicans want genuine reform instead of a few stunts by anti-immigrant legislators, the time has come for President Bush and Congress to help them get it.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1804516,"ids":1804516,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush's call for the lame duck Congress to pass pending ''bipartisan energy legislation'' before it leaves Washington forever is a very good example of why the House and Senate should limit their work in this final session to as few measures as possible. Congress needs to pass the budgets it failed to get done before the elections. And since no time should be lost in the Bush reassessment of Iraq, the Senate should consider the nomination of Robert Gates to be defense secretary.\n        And that should be the extent of the agenda.\n        The energy bill Mr. Bush apparently had in mind is in fact two bills, one in the Senate and another in the House. Both would authorize increased offshore drilling for oil and natural gas. But there are huge differences between them.\n        The Senate bill, co-sponsored by Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, is a narrowly drawn measure that would open a section of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas exploration and use part of the royalties to help rebuild Louisiana's battered wetlands and barrier islands. This page, setting aside earlier misgivings, has supported her bill because of its limited scope and its demonstrably worthy environmental objectives.\n        The House bill, by contrast, is a broad, mischievous and badly conceived piece of work sponsored by Richard Pombo, Republican of California, that, in a stroke, would lift a long-standing federal moratorium on oil and gas drilling along the entire American coastline. The bill has been vigorously opposed by most state governors from Maine to California.\n        There has always been a danger that the two bills would go to a conference committee where -- the Senate's assurances notwithstanding -- the usual horse-trading would produce a bad bill much along the lines of the House measure. That danger may now be greater. Mr. Pombo's defeat in last Tuesday's election raises the distinct possibility that he will make one last desperate effort to help his friends in the oil and gas industry before he retires into well-earned political obscurity.\n        The terrain during a lame duck session is notoriously treacherous. Our suggestion, therefore, is that Congress take a deep breath and postpone any energy legislation until next year. At that point, Ms. Landrieu, whose party will be in charge, can try again. Alternatively, she could work with other leaders to produce a true energy bill -- a comprehensive measure that would also seek to reduce consumption by encouraging more efficient cars and alternative fuels. As Ms. Landrieu concedes, drilling is only part of the energy equation. That is especially true for a country that uses one-quarter of the world's oil while holding less than 3 percent of its reserves.\n        Several such bills have already been introduced in the Senate, with considerable bipartisan support. This is where Congress -- and, one hopes, a newly receptive Mr. Bush -- should put their efforts in the new year.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1852327,"ids":1852327,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush's latest appeals court nominee, Leslie Southwick, has a disturbing history of insensitivity to blacks and other minority groups. The Senate should reject this nomination and make clear to the White House that it will reject all future nominees who do not meet the high standards of fairness that are essential for such important posts.\n        A non-negotiable quality for judicial nominees is that they must be committed to equal justice. Judge Southwick, whom President Bush has nominated for a seat on the New Orleans-based United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, repeatedly failed this test as a Mississippi state court judge.\n        He clearly failed the test when he ruled for a social worker who was rightfully fired for calling a black colleague ''a good ole nigger.'' Judge Southwick is known for siding with employers over employees -- but not in this case. In his ruling, he revealed a thorough lack of understanding of the odious impact of such language when he accepted the social worker's claim that the use of the slur was ''not motivated out of racial hatred or animosity directed toward her co-worker or toward blacks in general.'' Judge Southwick did not even vote to direct the state to consider a penalty short of firing, as the Mississippi Supreme Court later did.\n        And he failed the test when he joined a majority opinion that denied a bisexual mother custody of her child. Adding insult to injury, he joined a concurring opinion that went on to berate the mother for her ''decision to participate in a homosexual relationship'' and reminded her that one of the consequences of her ''exertion of her perceived right'' was that she might lose her child.\n        The Magnolia Bar Association, an association of black Mississippi lawyers founded when the state bar was restricted to whites, has urged the Senate to reject the nomination, saying, ''We question whether Judge Southwick will properly enforce the law when it comes to the rights of those who are unpopular and who are marginalized by the political process.'' They are right. After his performance as a state court judge, it would be hard for a black person with a discrimination case, or a gay person with a family law issue, to have any confidence that Judge Southwick would treat them fairly.\n        Judge Southwick's judicial record also shows the usual pattern of President Bush's judicial nominees: insensitivity toward workers, consumers and people injured by corporations. The federal appeals courts are already overloaded with judges who hold these biases.\n        When the voters put Democrats in the majority in Congress last fall, they were sending a message that the era of extremism in Washington should come to an end. Senate Democrats can show that they understood this message by rejecting Judge Southwick and insisting on a more moderate nominee, who will respect the rights of all.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1825749,"ids":1825749,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush's new budget would extend the administration's warped priorities deep into the realm of federally supported health care programs. The administration long ago sacrificed any meaningful domestic agenda to finance tax cuts for the wealthy and its reckless war in Iraq. The White House's reckless determination to make the tax cuts permanent is now driving it to slash domestic spending in health and other vital programs.\n        Instead of trying to address the underlying problems of escalating health care costs, Mr. Bush's strategy is to cut services or shift more of the bill to states, health care providers and individuals.\n        In the Medicare program, which covers health care for Americans aged 65 and over, the administration would find most of its savings by slowing the annual increase in reimbursements for services, forcing hospitals and other providers to absorb the burden. Given Medicare's precarious financial straits, the package appears broadly acceptable.\n        The real outrage is that the administration has not proposed comparable reductions in the large overpayments -- roughly 12 percent more per patient -- made to private managed care plans that enroll Medicare beneficiaries. The budget would also phase out Medicare bad-debt payments, forcing hospitals to swallow beneficiaries' unpaid bills.\n        The budget also looks to save money by eliminating inflation indexing so that as incomes rise, so would the number of people required to pay higher premiums. Although this is a sneaky way to raise premiums, it is hard to argue with the notion that better-off beneficiaries should pay more to help rescue a financially strained program.\n        What seems counterproductive is Mr. Bush's plan to lower federal matching funds for Medicaid administration -- forcing the states to find more of their own funds or sacrifice good management and oversight. More worrisome is his plan to cut back on state programs that insure the young.\n        The most shortsighted restrictions would come in the highly acclaimed State Children's Health Insurance Program, which uses federal matching funds to provide coverage for low- and moderate-income children who are not quite poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. The program has been enormously successful in reducing the number of uninsured children. Yet now the administration wants to reduce its matching rate and limit enrollment to children in households earning no more than twice the federal poverty level. That would undercut programs in 16 states that have expanded coverage to children above that level.\n        Although the administration's budget would grant the children's program a small $5 billion increase spread over five years, that's less than half, and possibly only a third, of the amount needed just to maintain current enrollments and participation rates. This is too high a price to pay for more tax cuts and Mr. Bush's ill-managed presidency.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1808509,"ids":1808509,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush's news conference yesterday with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq had an even greater than usual sense of unreality about it, with Mr. Bush insisting that Mr. Maliki is ''the right guy for Iraq'' and that American troops will stay ''until the job is complete,'' while Mr. Maliki asserted that his country is a democracy and he is not a captive of Shiite militias.\n        But the disconnect seemed even more stunning once you realized that Mr. Bush's national security adviser had sent him a memorandum three weeks ago describing how Iraq was being pulled apart by sectarian hatreds and warning that Mr. Maliki was either ''ignorant of what is going on'' or unwilling or unable to stop it.\n        The memo, which was published by The Times this week, at least answers the question of whether Mr. Bush is being told what's going on in Iraq. In it, his national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, describes how Mr. Maliki's Shiite-dominated government has deprived Sunnis of basic services, blocked military actions against Shiite targets and purged Iraq's most effective military commanders to ensure Shiite dominance. The memo also warns that Mr. Maliki may not have ''the political or security capabilities'' to free himself from his narrow militia-dominated political base.\n        But the president's performance this week -- his refusal to impose any deadlines on Mr. Maliki to start reconciliation talks and break with the militias, and his refusal to give the Pentagon a deadline to stand up an effective Iraqi Army -- tells us once again that Mr. Bush does not listen.\n        That does not bode well for James Baker and the Iraq Study Group, which, according to reports, is likely to call for some pullback of American combat troops along with more aggressive regional diplomacy. Yesterday, Mr. Bush seemed eager to preempt that advice, brushing off suggestions that he talk directly to Iran and insisting that there would be no ''graceful exit'' from Iraq.\n        Mr. Bush's lack of curiosity was well known even before he became president, but as time has gone on and bad news has mounted, that disinterested quality has turned into a stubborn refusal to hear bad news. The country simply cannot afford it any longer. Three years of having Mr. Bush trust only his gut has plunged Iraq into bloody chaos and done untold damage to America. There needs to be an urgent change in policy.\n        Mr. Hadley's memo actually provides a clue to how Mr. Bush has managed to avoid facing hard facts. Despite the horrific situation it describes, the policy recommendations fail to convey any strong sense of urgency and seem to shrug off American responsibility for what has gone wrong. Either the president's security adviser was afraid to be as blunt as the situation requires or he, too, has managed to convince himself that the disaster is really not all that disastrous.\n        The president's advisers need to tell him all the harsh truths about Iraq in the vivid terms they require; they need to tell him how little time he has left to act. This administration has been orchestrating a foreign policy disaster of epic proportions, and history will remember both that the president failed to hear the warning bells and that many others failed to ring them loudly enough.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1820686,"ids":1820686,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Bush's refusal to come up with a serious policy on Iraq means that the Democrats will have to goad him toward one.

It needs to insist that American troops are not captive to the destructive policies of an Iraqi government for which sectarian revenge counts for more than national unity and civil peace.\n        To do that, it needs to demand that Mr. Bush impose firm, enforceable benchmarks on Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki -- if any American troops are going to remain in Iraq.\n        In the Senate a nonbinding, bipartisan resolution seems headed toward early passage. Sponsored by Joseph Biden, Chuck Hagel and Carl Levin, it expresses strong opposition to sending more troops, citing the failure of the Iraqi government to keep its past promises on national reconciliation.\n        Passing this resolution by the widest possible bipartisan margin would be a good first step. It would make clear to the American people (who called for a change last November), to President Bush (who didn't listen) and to Mr. Maliki (who didn't seem to notice) that the days of uncritical American support for Shiite misrule are over.\n        Already, the newly questioning tone in Congress has pushed Mr. Maliki to distance himself -- at least publicly -- from his ally Moktada al-Sadr, whose Mahdi Army has been responsible for some of the worst outrages against Baghdad's Sunni population. It is too early to say whether this is a public relations ploy, or whether Mr. Maliki will now allow the Americans and his own army to move against Mahdi Army strongholds. The Senate resolution should make clear that that is the first prerequisite for continued American support.\n        Hortatory statements are unlikely to change Mr. Bush's mind or Mr. Maliki's behavior, so the Congress will likely have to go further. Both houses will need to find ways to use their power -- including the power of the purse -- to do what Mr. Bush refuses to do: set and enforce deadlines for the Iraqi government to disarm militias, share oil revenues and reintegrate the Sunni middle class into Iraqi life.\n        Funding limits that simply freeze the number of troops, like the one Senator Edward Kennedy now proposes, are inadequate. The much more difficult challenge is to figure out ways to compel Mr. Bush to come up with a policy that has at least some chance of letting American troops come home without leaving total chaos behind.\n        Even if the Congress could stop Mr. Bush from sending an additional 20,000 troops, there will still be 130,000 caught in Iraq's maelstrom.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1844253,"ids":1844253,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Dwight Eisenhower established May 1 as Law Day to co-opt the biggest day on the socialist calendar. While much of the world marked May Day with critiques of capitalism and parades celebrating working men and women, the United States would honor, President Eisenhower declared, the ''national dedication to the principle of government under laws.''\n        Despite its propagandistic beginnings, a day set aside to honor the rule of law was not a bad idea. On the first Law Day, in 1958, Gov. Averell Harriman of New York attacked Gov. Orval Faubus of Arkansas for blocking integration. His fight to keep black children out of the Little Rock Central High School ''offends the concept of law on which our society is based,'' Harriman insisted.\n        Law Day proved to be a boon to international law, which was seen during the cold war as a check on communism. In his proclamation creating the holiday, Eisenhower emphasized law's role ''in the settlement of international disputes.'' On Law Day 1959, Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut, grandfather of the current president, urged, remarkably, that international conflicts be settled by the World Court.\n        While the Soviet threat loomed, Law Day attracted a sizable following. In 1961, a headline in The Times reported, ''100,000 Law Day Celebrations Take Place Throughout Nation.'' But as the cold war waned, so did Law Day. It is marked today most notably by the American Bar Association, and it is perilously close to becoming a celebration of lawyers.\n        That is unfortunate. As long as there was a national consensus about the importance of the rule of law, Law Day felt superfluous, like celebrating gravity. But for six years now, the rule of law has been under attack. An array of doctrines has emerged to undermine it, like the enemy combatant doctrine, which says people can be held indefinitely without trial, and the unitary executive doctrine, which insists that a president can do as he wants in many areas, no matter what Congress says.\n        In keeping with tradition, President Bush has issued a proclamation inviting Americans today to ''celebrate the Constitution and the laws that protect our rights and liberties.'' It rings more than a little hollow, though, as he continues to trample on civil liberties in the war on terror, and stands by an attorney general who has politicized the Justice Department to a shocking degree.\n        The less committed a president is to the law, the more need there is for Law Day, which makes it a holiday whose time has come.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1813610,"ids":1813610,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has not been having a very good month, which is good news both for the beaten-down people of Iran and for the outside world.\n        The populist demagogue, it seems, is not so popular with important elements of Iranian society growing uneasy over the price Iran may have to pay for his belligerent pursuit of nuclear technology. This week, Mr. Ahmadinejad's oil minister acknowledged that foreign banks were pulling back from financing Iranian oil projects because of the worsening nuclear dispute.\n        The clearest evidence of Mr. Ahmadinejad's troubles came in last week's elections for municipal offices and the national council that oversees the work of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr. Ahmadinejad's supporters fared surprisingly poorly. The main gainers came from two very different opposition groups, one aligned with former President Ali Rafsanjani, an establishment conservative, and the other with remnants of the cautious reform movement led by former President Mohammad Khatami.\n        Mr. Rafsanjani, a venomous foe of Israel (with his own nuclear appetites), is so notorious for the corruption that marred his presidency that his political career had almost gone into eclipse. Mr. Khatami's followers are more high-minded, but still managed to fumble Iran's best chance for reform in decades. What distinguishes them from Mr. Ahmadinejad's supporters is their recognition that Iran exists in the real world. They understand that its future requires good relations with foreign investors, trade partners and educational institutions.\n        Mr. Ahmadinejad has been systematically dynamiting those relations, by defying the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations and with his loathsome circus of Holocaust denial. Though meant to whip up voters, that travesty failed to save his supporters from electoral defeat.\n        Last week, in a remarkable show of courage, students at one of Tehran's elite universities openly denounced Mr. Ahmadinejad as a dictator and a fascist, forcing him to cut short his planned address.\n        Their anger had been stoked by a blatantly political purge of professors and students, a crackdown on basic personal freedoms, and worries that economic mismanagement and diplomatic provocations were blighting their future. Two weeks ago, the students chanted, ''Forget the Holocaust -- do something for us.'' Last week, one of them told a reporter: ''A nuclear program is our right. But we fear that it will do more harm than good.''\n        Indeed it would, and it is encouraging to hear from Iranians who recognize that threat.

But trampling property rights is risky. It is as likely to leave Russia an economic pariah as an energy superpower.\n        The latest intrigue centers on a huge oil and natural-gas project off of Russia's eastern coast. The project, Sakhalin 2, includes offshore platforms and the world's biggest liquefied natural gas plant. It is also the single largest foreign investment in Russia. Royal Dutch Shell owns a 55 percent stake, but won't for much longer from the looks of things.\n        It appears that the Kremlin is again trying to muscle an energy company into doing its bidding, this time with environmental regulators. Russian officials have threatened to halt the project by revoking necessary operating permits and warning that they might criminally prosecute Shell employees over supposed ecological violations.\n        While the project is hardly spick-and-span, industry analysts say the arbitrary enforcement of oft-ignored regulations is a barely disguised power grab for the $20 billion project. Shell refuses to comment publicly, but after months of pressure has offered to sell a sizable, possibly controlling stake in Sakhalin 2 to Gazprom, Russia's state gas giant. Russian authorities have been pressuring other foreign energy companies, including threatening to revoke BP's license for a natural-gas field near China.\n        This has not sparked the outcry you might expect. The European Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, has called the pressure on Shell ''a matter of concern.'' Maybe the muted tone has something to do with Gazprom's supplying over a quarter of Europe's natural gas. It hardly seems like sound energy policy to allow a country with so little respect for contracts to supply a critical share of heating and electric needs. Foreign investors, like Shell, also have to ask whether they are going to keep giving Russia a pass just because of its impressive energy reserves. Business deals should look a lot less attractive if the Kremlin decides it can ''renegotiate'' contracts on a whim.\n        Russia's leverage -- even in an era of tight energy supplies -- is not as great as it appears. The country is already facing the very real possibility of declining production and will need the expertise and capital of foreign companies to keep exploiting its natural resources. Western governments and companies should remind Moscow of that vulnerability.\n        Moscow also needs to be reminded that threatening property rights will eventually dissuade all investments.

And while the nomination process is very tightly controlled, the eventual winner often comes as a surprise to many Iranians and most outsiders.\n        That pattern repeated itself with the landslide victory of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last week. A radically conservative mayor of Tehran and former member of the thuggish Basij militia, Mr. Ahmadinejad little resembles the departing president, Mohammad Khatami, a reformist intellectual. But like Mr. Khatami in his initial upset victory eight years ago, Mr. Ahmadinejad dethroned a better-known establishment candidate, in this case a former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n        Mr. Rafsanjani lost because he was too closely associated with the recent economic failures and political inertia. Mr. Ahmadinejad, in contrast, offered a populist economic platform that implicitly challenged the cronyism and corruption of more than a quarter-century of clerical rule. We wish him luck. But it is hard to see how he can deliver on those promises over the objections of the ruling establishment, whose powers greatly exceed his own.\n        On the issue of greatest current concern to the United States, Iran's steady progress toward the ability to produce nuclear bomb fuel, Mr. Ahmadinejad's victory is expected to lead to greater intransigence and less interest in compromise. Any acceptable deal would have to include an Iranian commitment to halt efforts to enrich uranium or separate plutonium, which can produce nuclear bomb fuel.\n        Mr. Ahmadinejad's initial statements on this issue have been ambiguous, favoring continued pursuit of nuclear technology and continued diplomacy. Perhaps, a fiery nationalist like Mr. Ahmadinejad may be just the right man to cut a nuclear deal, just as it took Richard Nixon to reach out to Communist China. But we doubt it; the greater trade and investment that a deal would bring may not mean much to a politician whose greatest political appeal has come from promising a return to the austere, self-reliant ideology of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.\n        Unless the long-stalled talks with Britain, France and Germany make some real progress in the very near future, these European powers should acknowledge that diplomacy has failed and refer the Iranian nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council.

An obvious first step would be to abolish senselessly punitive laws that make it difficult for felons to reconstruct their lives, like those in all 50 states that bar ex-convicts from occupations that have nothing at all to do with their crimes. Another prudent step would be to create high-quality programs that provide newly released people with counseling and job placement. Perhaps most crucially, those who qualify need assistance in getting back their federal disability and Medicaid benefits; inmates typically lose such benefits when they find themselves locked up for 30 days or more.\n        The loss of benefits is especially devastating for the mentally ill, who make up one-sixth of the prison population and who are particularly susceptible to recidivism. Most of them get psychiatric drugs and treatment for the first time in jail. They often improve quickly, but deteriorate just as fast when they are released without being re-enrolled in federal disability programs or Medicaid, which would give them access to medication and psychiatric care. Homeless, delusional and out of control, they are inevitably rearrested for behaviors related to their illnesses. Many of them come back to jail so regularly that corrections workers call them ''frequent fliers.''\n        Impoverished people who suffer from mental illnesses and other serious disabilities are entitled to Supplemental Security Income assistance, handled through the Social Security Administration. In many states, people who are declared eligible for Social Security-based benefits are automatically enrolled in Medicaid, which in turn provides mentally ill people with care and drugs.\n        Federal law requires that people be suspended from S.S.I. benefits when they land in jail for even a short time. The federal government diligently enforces the suspension rules -- and even pays a small bounty to the prisons and jails in exchange for notice that a beneficiary has been incarcerated. But the institutions are offered no incentives to report that inmates are about to be released and need to have their benefits restored. Moreover, the rules governing the program are so vague and complicated that most prison officials don't understand them.\n        A similar situation has developed with Medicaid, which bars states from receiving federal matching funds for treatment given to inmates except in acute cases requiring hospitalization. The federal government envisioned an arrangement under which Medicaid benefits would be suspended during incarceration and resumed upon release. But the states have resorted to terminating inmate eligibility outright and allowing inmates, including the mentally ill, to leave custody without access to care.\n        The states, which are already being shortchanged by the federal government on Medicaid, got another scare recently when the Bush administrated suggested that it might shift even more of the burden. Pressed for money, the states have clearly opted to save dollars by taking inmates off Medicaid rolls and leaving them off for as long as possible.\n        But mentally ill inmates who are dumped onto the streets without access to care drive up incarceration costs by going back to jail again and again. The smarter approach would be to ensure that eligible inmates had disability and Medicaid benefits in hand before they left jail. Setting up the new administrative process might not be easy, but it would more than pay for itself down the line.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1719545,"ids":1719545,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel offered up several tantalizing morsels yesterday to explain his decision to dump the Likud Party. He said he wants to ''lay the foundation'' toward ''the permanent borders of the state.'' That, of course, hints that he is willing to engage in the territorial compromise necessary for achieving peace with the Palestinians, something members of the right wing of Likud can't get their heads around. He said he has ''no intention of allowing anyone to miss'' the ''historic opportunity'' brought by Israel's withdrawal from Gaza last summer. Again, another hint at territorial compromise.\n        But perhaps his most telling comment was that Likud, which Mr. Sharon himself helped create, ''is unable to lead Israel toward its national goals.'' It is astounding to hear those words coming from the man who has embodied Likud for the past three decades. But while Likud has stayed largely the same in those decades, Mr. Sharon has evolved, like the nation he has helped to shape.\n        In the 1950's, he trained and led the commandos who were so quick and deadly at reprisals. In 1973, he led the crossing of the Suez Canal that helped end the Yom Kippur War. In 1982, he led Israel's invasion of Lebanon, and later was found indirectly responsible -- by an Israeli commission of inquiry -- for the massacre by Christian militiamen of Palestinians in two refugee camps. In 2000, he detonated the Palestinian intifada when, surrounded by hundreds of policemen and soldiers, he visited the plateau in Jerusalem that the Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary and the Jews call the Temple Mount.\n        Yet in 2005, Mr. Sharon, the architect of Israel's settlement policy, did what no other Israeli leader has ever done: in withdrawing from the desert Israel seized 38 years ago, Mr. Sharon unilaterally ceded land that Palestinians claim for their future state. Mr. Sharon was resolute in the face of condemnation from right-wing members of Likud, and the Gaza withdrawal is what brought Mr. Sharon to the podium yesterday for that press conference, in which he announced to the world his disengagement from Likud. Alongside the election of Amir Peretz as the new leader of the Labor Party, the events of the last two weeks have brought Israelis to a stark choice about their country's direction.\n        The coming national elections will bring many issues into relief. Will the country capitalize on the Gaza withdrawal to forge ahead in peace talks with the Palestinians? Will Israel finally talk seriously about abandoning the settlements in the West Bank, which it must leave for a Palestinian state -- and peace -- to be a realistic outcome?\n        Polls say Mr. Sharon has popular good will in Israel today, and without the baggage of Likud he certainly has the credibility to push Israel in the direction it needs to go. Whether he chooses to do so remains to be seen. But one thing is clear. Mr. Sharon couldn't lead Israel toward its national goals as long as he embodied Likud.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1830779,"ids":1830779,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Public humiliation in the stocks long ago fell out of fashion. A virtual version is making a comeback. This time it's a self-imposed punishment for debtors trying to abase their way back into the black.\n        As John Leland reported recently in The Times, people have started their own debt blogs to share the most intimate details of their faltering finances, hoping their online confessions will help them develop some self-restraint.\n        Every time the bloggers reach for a credit card, the realization that they will have to confess any splurges is supposed to give them pause. The 29-year-old woman who writes bloggingawaydebt.com -- identified only as Tricia -- keeps a running tally of her obligations in the upper-right-hand corner of the Web page (just over $22,000 right now, down from almost $38,000). Right below that is the button that allows readers to sign up to receive updates: 349 regulars are keeping a watchful eye.\n        They were fairly understanding when she and her husband went roughly $100 over budget on Christmas presents for their son, though one comment suggested they ''start the new year with redoubled determination.'' Hard to be too tough on them since they've already wiped out over $15,000 in debt.\n        Consumers are asking others to help them develop self-control because so many companies are not showing any restraint. The Federal Reserve estimates that credit card companies sent out more than six billion direct-mail solicitations in 2005. Last year the average American household was $21,000 in debt, about a third of that on credit cards.\n        In response to the explosion in consumer debt, Congress passed a law in 2005 making it more difficult for individuals to declare bankruptcy. But legislators did nothing to curb the blizzard of pre-approved cards that fall through the mail slots. Often the most profitable customers are the least responsible ones. At a Senate Banking Committee hearing in January, Chairman Christopher Dodd cited a study estimating that credit-card penalty fees had risen to $17.1 billion in 2006 from $1.7 billion in 1996.\n        Credit can be a good thing, both for simplifying transactions and helping people get over a temporary crunch. But Congress needs to do more to make rates and fees more transparent while putting an end to some of the most abusive policies. In a fairly common practice known as universal default, for instance, a credit card company raises interest rates because a consumer missed or was late with a payment on a different company's account. Citigroup just announced that its credit-card business would voluntarily end the practice. That's something good to blog about for a change.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1832155,"ids":1832155,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Put aside Myanmar and Russia for the moment. The latest battleground over the suppression of civil liberties, over the consequences of speaking freely, is a lot closer to home. It's in what Anahad O'Connor described in The Times last week as the ''affluent hamlet'' of Cross River, where three girls, juniors at John Jay High School, got in trouble for saying the word ''vagina'' at a school function after faculty members told them not to.\n        The battle, which spread quickly beyond the campus to television, the Internet and the newspapers, has separated the world into camps. They differ over whether the principal, Rich Leprine, is a tyrant for insisting that the girls be suspended -- not, he insists, for saying a naughty word while reading a selection from the play ''The Vagina Monologues,'' but for insubordination.\n        Mr. Leprine says they reneged on an agreement to avoid using the word at the forum, sponsored by the school's literary magazine, after being told that young children could be present. The girls deny making such an agreement.\n        The issue will be revisited at a school board meeting on Tuesday. It seems safe to predict a full house, between the anxious parents, prickly disciplinarians, ''vagina warriors'' and student snickerers.\n        A few thoughts:\n        1) This is a world in which journalists who offend oppressive governments are shot, poisoned and, in one possible case in Russia, thrown out of fourth-floor windows. The suffering endured by truth-tellers is severe. By these standards, a one-day, in-school suspension hardly qualifies as tyrannical. But still: free speech is precious, and the girls are right to stress its importance, even if doing so embroils them and their school in a tempest that to many seems overblown.\n        2) At a school function -- such as a staged reading in which the school provides the stage -- students are generally expected to play by school rules, even ones that seem silly. ''We did it because we believe in the word vagina,'' one of the girls said.\n        Well, some may argue, they may believe in chewing gum, too, or wearing black-soled shoes on the gym floor, but is it not reasonable for school authorities to impose well-reasoned restrictions on expressing such beliefs? It is. But an awkward attempt to prohibit a highly innocuous use of the so-called V-word dives headlong into the touchy, troubling realm of censorship, where a public school -- of all places -- should not go.\n        3) The battle does not make Mr. Leprine look very deft. He issued a gag order and suspension threat when eye-rolling good humor would have served him much better. His squeamishness about the word vagina is hard to understand, and by overreacting to it, he fueled a brouhaha that threatens to trivialize real concerns about free expression.\n        4) Words are nothing to be afraid of. But they don't like to be stifled.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1653883,"ids":1653883,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Putting up displays of the Ten Commandments in government buildings has become a popular way to test the limits of the First Amendment. The displays' backers, who will argue their case before the Supreme Court today, say they are not challenging the separation of church and state, just acknowledging God's authority in a way the founding fathers would have appreciated. They're wrong, and the court should order the displays removed.\n        The cases involve Texas, where there has been a six-foot-tall Ten Commandments monument between the Capitol and the State Supreme Court since 1961, and Kentucky, where McCreary and Pulaski Counties posted the Ten Commandments in their county courthouses in 1999. In both cases, the backers of the Ten Commandments' displays are arguing that any religious message they may send is diluted by their surroundings. After the American Civil Liberties Union sued, the Kentucky counties also posted other documents, like the Declaration of Independence and the lyrics of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.'' Texas argues that secular monuments are also on the Capitol grounds. But those monuments are all a significant distance away from the Ten Commandments monument, which is topped by the phrase ''I am the Lord thy God'' in large letters.\n        The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits Congress from making laws ''respecting an establishment of religion,'' and the Supreme Court has long held that the same rule must be applied to the states. The Ten Commandments represent specifically Judeo-Christian beliefs. Even within the Judeo-Christian tradition, there are significantly different versions of the commandments. Kentucky and Texas have chosen to display the Protestant Ten Commandments, rather than the Catholic or Jewish versions.\n        Accepting the separation of church and state does not mean that all references to religion must be excised from public life. The Supreme Court has long recognized that the government can display a religious symbol, provided it is part of a clearly secular display. The courtroom in which the Ten Commandments case will be argued has an image of Moses' accepting the tablets as part of a montage of lawgivers throughout history. But the Kentucky and Texas displays fall far short of that standard.\n        Adding the national anthem to the Kentucky displays or pointing to other statues in the distance in Texas cannot undo the displays' clear motivation: tying the legal system to Protestantism. The wall between church and state dates proudly to the earliest days of the republic. The founders may not have anticipated a country with many Hindu and Buddhist Americans, but they were wise enough to write a document that protects their rights. Our increasingly diverse nation must not appear to prefer some religions, and some citizens, over others.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1834147,"ids":1834147,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Readers will recall that the Democrats promised to upend the status quo as soon as they won majority control.

Presented with another opportunity to reform the Corps -- its weaknesses exposed by the levee failures in New Orleans and other misjudgments predating Hurricane Katrina -- Democrats on the House transportation committee took a dive.\n        The committee approved a huge $40 billion water resources development bill that is loaded with pork-barrel projects dear to Congress's heart but, partly for that reason, is devoid of any serious reforms to an agency that over the years has inflated the economic payoffs of its projects while underestimating their potential damage to the environment. The measure, virtually identical to last year's Republican bill, seems assured of passage.\n        Hopes for reform now lie with the Senate, where John McCain and Russell Feingold are still seeking, against heavy odds, to require two major and essential changes in the way the corps does business. One would require truly independent review of the design, cost and environmental consequences of all corps projects costing more than $40 million.\n        The second reform would require that projects be ranked by an interagency committee of experts in order of importance based on priorities like flood control and environmental restoration. This reform is aimed at Congress itself, since members tend to regard projects that benefit their own districts and electoral prospects as more important than any others, and are thus incapable of anything approaching dispassionate judgment,\n        If Senator Barbara Boxer, who leads the Environment and Public Works Committee, fails to persuade her colleagues to accept these provisions in committee, the two senators will try to attach them to the water resources bill on the Senate floor.\n        In addition to the usual ration of pork, the bill contains several very important provisions, including vital and long-overdue financing for the Everglades restoration project, as well as money to begin the essential task of rebuilding Louisiana's vulnerable coastal wetlands.

Both donors said they had chosen that group, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, because it offers a most cost-effective way to save lives. ''Supporting children's immunization is undoubtedly the best investment we've ever made,'' Bill Gates said.\n        The Gates Foundation's money will come in over 10 years, and Britain's over 15. Such long-term thinking is crucial for vaccines because it gives manufacturers a guaranteed market and allows countries to plan. The vaccine alliance was established in 2000 to provide this type of stability.\n        Long-term planning is also essential for AIDS treatment. The World Health Organization announced at the end of January that throughout the developing world, 700,000 people are now taking antiretroviral drugs, up from 440,000 just six months ago. Although that is only 12 percent of those who need such medicines, this number is likely to soar in the next year. But looming over this good news is the shadow of long-term needs: once people start taking AIDS treatment, they cannot stop. If they do, they will die, of course, and their virus may mutate into a resistant form that threatens treatment globally.\n        Unfortunately, AIDS patients in Africa must depend for their medicine on countries whose commitment is weak and unsteady. Rich countries themselves set a target of spending 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product on foreign aid. But the United States spends less than one-fourth of that target. Foreign aid has little domestic constituency, and is a favorite foil for politicians.\n        Even governments that understand how much good foreign aid can do give it short shrift when other demands arise. Tax cuts and the war in Iraq have led Mr. Bush to renege on commitments even to his most widely trumpeted programs, like his AIDS initiative and the Millennium Challenge program.\n        The easiest way to create a long-term stream of money not subject to an annual political fight is for rich countries to cancel the poorest nations' debts. At a meeting earlier this month, the world's wealthiest nations agreed in principle to this. They must finally take this long-overdue step. Sub-Saharan Africa pays $15 billion a year in debt service, which is enough to fight AIDS. It is four times what it spends on health care, and more than it gets in foreign aid.\n        Britain has come up with a clever way to reduce the burden of costly diseases now and save money in the future. British officials want to create an International Financing Facility, which would raise money in the financial markets by floating bonds backed by governments' promises of future aid. The money raised would go to increase vaccine coverage through the vaccine alliance and, if the facility expanded, to fight AIDS. The British proposal has substantial European backing, and it should proceed, although, typically, the Bush administration hates it.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1843372,"ids":1843372,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Reliance on abstinence-only sex education as the primary tool to reduce teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases -- as favored by the Bush administration and conservatives in Congress -- looks increasingly foolish and indefensible.\n        The abstinence-only campaign has always been driven more by ideology than by sound public health policy. The program's tight rules, governing states that accept federal matching funds and community organizations that accept federal grants, forbid the promotion of contraceptive use and require teaching that sex outside marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects.\n        At least nine states, by one count, have decided to give up the federal matching funds rather than submit to dictates that undermine sensible sex education. Now there is growing evidence that the programs have no effect on children's sexual behavior.\n        A Congressionally mandated report issued this month by the Mathematica Policy Research firm found that elementary and middle school students in four communities who received abstinence instruction -- sometimes on a daily basis -- were just as likely to have sex in the following years as students who did not get such instruction. Those who became sexually active -- about half of each group -- started at the same age (14.9 years on average) and had the same number of sexual partners. The chief caveat is that none of the four programs studied continued the abstinence instruction into high school, the most sexually active period for most teenagers, so it is not known whether more sustained abstinence education would show more effectiveness.\n        Supporters of abstinence-only education sometimes point to a sharp decline in teenage pregnancy rates in recent years as proof that the programs must be working. But a paper by researchers at Columbia University and the Guttmacher Institute, published in the January issue of The American Journal of Public Health, attributed 86 percent of the decline to greater and more effective use of contraceptives -- and only 14 percent to teenagers' deciding to wait longer to start having sex. At the very least, that suggests that the current policy of emphasizing abstinence and minimizing contraceptive use should be turned around.\n        As Congress prepares to debate further financing, it should either drop the abstinence-only program as a waste of money or broaden it to include safe-sex instruction. Abstinence deserves to be part of a comprehensive sex education effort, but not the only part.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1837201,"ids":1837201,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Residents of Westchester can always mark the arrival of spring by the emergence of the annual crop of initiatives in County Executive Andrew Spano's State of the County address.\n        They pop up like crocuses -- small and colorful and impossible to dislike. This year's batch included the announcement that the county's new weapon against identity theft -- the ShredMobile, a paper shredder mounted in a truck -- had driven around and destroyed more than 12 tons of confidential household documents, and the news that the county would be giving away 5,000 energy-saving light bulbs in honor of Earth Day.\n        But Mr. Spano's speech on March 22 also included something bigger, bolder and more interesting than usual, a proposal that deserved closer scrutiny than it got. That was his announcement that the county would help to create an affordable-housing land trust.\n        Few problems in the New York region are more pressing than the cost of housing, and few seem more intractable. Westchester, with a tight housing market and high tax burden, is an acutely unaffordable place to live. Despite the best efforts of people like Mr. Spano to invite, cajole or tempt developers to build lots of units that middle-class people can afford, the market has not responded.\n        The county, in fact, may even be losing ground, Mr. Spano said, noting that the supply of government-subsidized Mitchell-Lama housing was steadily dwindling. These are units built under a 1950's state law that gave substantial financial breaks to developers who supplied apartments for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. Tens of thousands of such units were built, with restrictions that they be kept affordable for decades. Now, however, landlords of these aging properties are exercising their right to opt out of the system -- forgoing tax breaks in return for the ability to charge market rents, or converting their units to high-priced condominiums. Thousands of residents are thus facing the looming possibility of being priced out of an ever-shrinking rental market.\n        Mr. Spano is looking for a way to shelter affordable units from market forces forever. Under his proposal, parcels would be bought by the county and transferred to a nonprofit organization, the Housing Land Trust, which would lease them to developers on the condition that the units built on them be priced affordably in perpetuity. This tactic has been used on a modest scale by private, nonprofit organizations and cities. But Mr. Spano says his proposal -- a county-run land trust made up of parcels scattered over a wide area -- is the first of its kind in New York State.\n        The challenge Mr. Spano faces, of course, is making the proposal reach critical mass, to build an entity big enough to avoid being a small-bore curiosity. That is why he also urged local communities to consider donating land to the trust. Those who do would be endorsing Mr. Spano's laudable conviction that the highest and best use of a given parcel of land may not be one more Westchester McMansion for a hedge-fund manager, but a half-dozen units, say, for regular people -- the teachers, firefighters, young couples and retirees who are increasingly unable to find a place to live in a county they would so love to call home.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1766604,"ids":1766604,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Responding to a lawsuit from Cory Booker, Newark's mayor-elect, a judge in New Jersey's Superior Court has ordered Newark's Municipal Council to stop selling off city-owned property at scandalously low prices.

In one case, the Council approved the sale of 69,500 square feet to a foundation for $278,000 -- $4 a square foot. The foundation plans to build nearly 20 multifamily homes and sell them for a profit. In another, a developer paid $185,000 -- again, about $4 a square foot -- for property on which it plans to build just over a dozen market-rate multifamily dwellings.\n        It should come as no surprise that the developers have not been asked to give something back -- a park, perhaps, or some other public amenity, in exchange for accepting the city's largesse.

What should have been a symbolic passage out of Iraq's darkest era will instead fuel a grim new era of spiraling sectarian vengeance.\n        The ugly episode shows why Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki is never likely to produce the national unity government that Washington keeps demanding and that Iraq so desperately needs.\n        Mr. Maliki is now scrambling to extricate himself from the public relations disaster. Yesterday, his office announced the arrest of a guard who allegedly took the unauthorized video. But the fundamental blame belongs to Mr. Maliki, who personally orchestrated the timing and circumstances of last Saturday's execution.\n        Mr. Maliki ignored pleas for delay from Washington and the legal niceties of Iraq's Constitution. He rushed to deliver Mr. Hussein's death as a holiday gift to his hard-line Shiite constituency, especially followers of the radical cleric and militia leader Moktada al-Sadr, who were allowed to chant abuse at the condemned dictator while he stood at the gallows with the noose around his neck.\n        Mr. Maliki's usual cheerleaders, President Bush and Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, have distanced themselves from this repellent spectacle. Yet the Bush administration again finds that it has little credibility to lecture anyone on the basic dignity due to detainees. The Washington Post reported yesterday on an internal F.B.I. investigation that revealed a pattern of deliberate taunting of the religious beliefs of Muslim prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo.\n        As Mr. Bush prepares his latest plan for Iraq, he must face up to bleak realities. As of January, 2007, Iraq lacks an army capable of standing on its own. It lacks a justice system that puts the rule of law over political expediency, while its police force is dominated by sectarian militias and thugs. Most crucially, it lacks a government committed to protect the rights and personal safety of all Iraqis.\n        Most Americans, whatever their view of the war, understand that the rule of Saddam Hussein brought a murderous curse and untold suffering upon the Iraqi people. Mr. Hussein has now gone to his grave. But the outrageous manner of his killing, deliberately mimicking his own depraved methods, assures that his cruelty will outlive him.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1718469,"ids":1718469,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Say this for the sad-sack Republicans in Congress: they really know how to get things done when it comes to meaningless face-saving legislation.\n        The House's biggest accomplishment in recent days may be its decision to scratch those two notorious Alaskan bridges to nowhere, a $442 million chunk of highway pork that made a national laughing stock of the lawmakers -- supposedly financial conservatives -- who stuffed it into the budget.\n        The retreat provides a definitive example of the legislative hypocrisy now gripping Congress. It won't actually save money because the funds will be shifted to Alaska's general transportation kitty for who-knows-what disposal. Actually taking unnecessary money away from the home state of a powerful Republican senator is a lift far beyond the lawmakers' capacity.\n        As if to make the point, the Senate was simultaneously refusing to reform the nation's scandalous antiterrorism financing. Senators narrowly on guard for parochial self-interest killed the House's plan to fix the skewed formula. Talk about pork. The financing formula fairly oinks at the terrorist threat as it shortchanges high-risk cities and ports and rewards rural states with more antiterror funds per capita than California, Texas and New York. The House proposal, co-sponsored by John Sweeney and Peter King, Republicans of New York, and Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat, would cut back on patently unthreatened areas while still allowing each state a minimum of 0.25 percent of the total funds for first responders and other antiterrorism operations.\n        Senate parochialism carried the day in the secret horse-trading over assorted parts of the Patriot Act's renewal. As a result, the original law will prevail, with its guaranteed minimum of 0.75 percent. In practice, this formula has proved to be not a ceiling, only a starting point for negotiating still more wasteful funds for sparsely populated states.\n        Bush administration officials and the independent 9\/11 commission have warned of the risks in maintaining the current formula. But lately Congress's idea of homeland security has been political posturing. The House has been wallowing through its great ''budget hawk'' melodrama -- making a show of slashing Medicaid spending for the poor while quietly preparing still more tax cuts for the rich. Meanwhile, the Senate has passed resolutions on Iraq aimed at making it very clear that whatever happens, the members up for re-election should not be held responsible.\n        No one expects any profiles in courage, or even difficult decisions, from this House and Senate. But putting local political pork above the protection of major terror targets is just pathetic.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1782494,"ids":"1782494,1782546","split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Say you decide to write a generous check to a political candidate. The limit in a federal campaign is $2,100 per person -- enough to make a statement but hardly enough enough to buy serious influence on Capitol Hill. But if the politician is running for state office in Albany, instead of Washington, $2,100 is pocket change. The ceiling on what one person can contribute to a New York State politician is a whopping $50,100. That is not a typo. That is $50,100 per person per statewide candidate in New York, which happens to be more than the average New Yorker's annual salary.\n        What is worse is that $50,100 is not even the real limit for those who want to keep on giving. As Danny Hakim of The Times reported recently, a limited liability company, or L.L.C., can give another $50,100. And since there are a lot of these mini-corporations, one person, plus family and friends, can give a ton. For example, a friend of Charlie King, a Democratic candidate for state attorney general, has managed to give over $500,000 working the L.L.C. route.\n        And Mr. King is not alone. His opponents for attorney general have also milked these corporate money cows. Andrew Cuomo, the front-runner in that race, has received over $100,000 from one L.L.C. group, and Mark Green, another attorney general candidate, has taken in $165,000 from his brother with the help of L.L.C.'s.\n        The Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law says that that corporations are limited to a total of $5,000 in political contributions each year. But 10 years ago, the State Board of Elections ruled that L.L.C.'s can operate as individuals when it comes to giving candidates money. The companies are usually very small, often a few people or so, with no stockholders or other corporate culture. So state campaigns are suddenly seeing a lot more contributions from L.L.C.'s.\n        ''This is just another idiotic example of New York's ridiculous campaign finance system,'' says an exasperated Blair Horner of New York Public Interest Research Group in Albany.\n        Mr. Horner has been trying to persuade New York's Legislature to pass campaign finance reform for decades. Like other public interest advocates, Mr. Horner is pushing for lower contribution limits, an end to slush funds for parties, better reporting and public financing. And, of course, campaign spending that's limited to real campaign expenses, not cars or country club fees or veterinarian fees for the office pet.\n        It is deeply frustrating to watch New York's politicians routinely proclaim how eager they are to reform campaign financing even as they rake in the money. Of course they never manage to clean things up. Gov. George Pataki, for instance, has been promising campaign finance reform since 1998. As things stand now, it is highly unlikely that this will be part of his legacy when his 12 years in office come to close in December.\n        Eliot Spitzer, the Democrat who is the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Pataki, has also promised to reform New York's embarrassing campaign system. Mr. Spitzer, who has received his fair share of L.L.C. funds, would have to persuade legislators to go along. And right now most would prefer to do what those in Albany do best -- to keep promising but never limit the flow of money funneled into their campaign accounts.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1710557,"ids":1710557,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Scientists experimenting with mice have devised two new ways to derive embryonic stem cells without destroying viable embryos. The work is being hailed for its potential to sidestep some of the ethical controversies that have slowed stem cell research in this country. But each of the new techniques raises ethical issues of its own, and neither is apt to be ready for use in humans for many years.\n        These and other approaches to deriving stem cells without destroying embryos clearly deserve further research, but they must not be allowed to halt or slow the most proven method of obtaining embryonic stem cells -- extracting them from human embryos that are inevitably destroyed in the process.\n        One technique, developed by scientists at Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Mass., is comparable to a procedure already performed at in vitro fertilization clinics to diagnose genetic defects. An embryo is allowed to grow to eight cells, then one cell is plucked out and the remaining seven allowed to go on and develop. In the clinic, the eighth cell would be tested for genetic defects. The new work shows that it could instead be used to derive stem cells.\n        Unfortunately, the approach has drawbacks. Although some 2,000 babies have been born after a cell was extracted for genetic diagnosis, there is little data on the safety of the procedure or the long-term health of the children. Some ethicists deem it unethical to impose even a small risk on the embryo by extracting a cell just to create stem cells. Moreover, the technique has limited scientific value because it cannot produce a stem cell with the exact genetic makeup of a particular individual.\n        The other technique, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a variant of the method known as ''therapeutic cloning,'' which can produce exact genetic matches but is anathema to religious conservatives because it involves first creating and then destroying a human embryo. The M.I.T. research demonstrates the feasibility of an approach recommended by William Hurlbut, a Stanford professor and member of the President's Council on Bioethics, to avoid ethical objections. Instead of creating a full-fledged embryo, the scientists manipulated genes to create embryo-like entities that were incapable of implanting in the uterus.\n        Some critics consider it morally objectionable to genetically engineer a defective embryo that can't implant. But advocates of this approach believe it can be refined to produce disorganized clumps of tissue that will be deemed biological artifacts, not nascent life.\n        It would be great if some way could be found to produce embryonic stem cells of high scientific value without raising ethical objections. But until that day comes, it would be foolish to abandon proven techniques just to meet the ethical objections of a minority.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1649694,"ids":1649694,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Sean O'Keefe, the departing administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, has yanked the agency's most important scientific instrument off life support. His refusal to budget any funds to service and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope looks like the petulant final act of an administrator who made a foolish decision and then refused to back down in the face of withering criticism from experts. The only uncertainty is whether the decision to let the Hubble die prematurely was solely Mr. O'Keefe's or reflects the judgment of higher-ups in the administration that servicing the Hubble would be a diversion from the president's long-range program of space exploration.\n        The Hubble by all accounts has been one of the most productive instruments in the history of science, largely because periodic servicing missions by shuttle astronauts have extended its life and upgraded its instruments. A fifth servicing mission had been planned, and the new instruments already built, when the Columbia disaster grounded the three remaining shuttles for repairs. Then, without any warning, Mr. O'Keefe shocked scientists by announcing that the servicing mission would be canceled for good because it would be too risky.\n        Nothing, it seems, can budge him from that snap judgment. When a dumbfounded Congress insisted that he seek advice from the National Academy of Sciences, he reluctantly agreed, but made it clear that nothing the academy said was apt to change his mind. He urged the academy instead to focus on ways to extend Hubble's usefulness without the help of astronauts. As it turned out, a panel of experts assembled by the academy concluded that there was little chance the robotic mission favored by Mr. O'Keefe could be mounted in time. The panel urged instead that astronauts be sent to the rescue. It judged such a flight only marginally more risky than a flight to the International Space Station.\n        Undeterred, Mr. O'Keefe is now blaming the academy for sealing the Hubble's doom. He still insists that a shuttle flight would be too risky, mostly because there would be no place to take refuge should problems arise, and now he complains that a robotic mission would be impractical as well because the academy dismissed its prospects for success. So he has wiped the budget clean of all rescue funds except for a future robotic mission to ensure that Hubble falls out of orbit safely.\n        Congress, which declared in a conference report last year that servicing the Hubble should be one of NASA's highest priorities, needs to order NASA to keep planning for a rescue mission. Some legislators may wonder if a servicing mission is worth the effort, given recent testimony by eminent scientists that they would be reluctant to see NASA's science programs socked with $1 billion to $2 billion in charges for the Hubble rescue -- a huge sum that would disrupt other high-priority programs -- but would consider $300 million to $400 million acceptable. That bookkeeping issue is a diversion. The refurbished shuttles will eventually return to flight, and the marginal cost for sending one to the Hubble would not be prohibitive. Upgrading the Hubble is probably the most important contribution today's astronauts could make.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1649531,"ids":1649531,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Senator Nicholas A. Spano wants you to know he is a changed man.\n        Anyone would be after a near-death experience like the one he had, coming within 18 votes of unemployment in the longest, most excruciating State Senate election in generations. Reached in Albany a day after the battle ended, he sounded gracious -- and chastened.\n        ''I recognize that there were 57,055 people who did not vote for me,'' he said. ''To those 57,055, I want them to know that I hear them, I'm listening, that I know they're unhappy with the process and they want change.''\n        Mr. Spano, you may remember, had promised to be a voice for change even before Election Day, when he joined Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat, in calling for a host of reforms in Albany, including constitutional amendments to change the state's benighted budgeting process. It seemed to us then that Mr. Spano, an 18-year Senate incumbent, was rather late in trying to squeeze onto the reform bandwagon, probably because of a particularly tough challenge from his Democratic opponent, the Westchester legislator Andrea Stewart-Cousins.\n        But that's moot now. Mr. Spano made his case and won the race. And now, as the duly re-elected representative of a heavily Democratic district and the No. 3 Republican in Albany, Mr. Spano is well-positioned to make good on his vows and to become an effective bridge between reform-minded Democrats and the party in power. There is plenty for him to do. So far, the Senate's majority party has talked a good game when it comes to open government or giving some say to rank-and-file legislators. But when the time comes to act, they continually fail to deliver.\n        Meanwhile, back in the district, a lot of time has been wasted. While Mr. Spano was stewing at home and his lawyers were battling in court, Gov. George E. Pataki submitted a budget that, as expected, contained no miracle bailout for the Yonkers schools. The Westchester Medical Center, hemorrhaging money and jobs, still needs rescuing. Mr. Spano said his first priority was to restore financing for highway patrols by the county police in Westchester, a $2.6 million contract involving 31 officers that the governor's budget eliminated.\n        He vows to ''work overtime to get things done,'' which presumably means tackling the reforms he and Mr. Brodsky proposed last October, among them a call for a constitutional convention to tackle the state's dysfunctional decision-making process. But Mr. Spano seems less energized to reform the one part of New York's political culture with which he has had the most recent experience -- elections.\n        He acknowledges that New York needs to fix its voting procedures -- that voting machines need upgrading and that election inspectors, who miscounted hundreds of votes in his favor in Yonkers on election night, need to be paid more and trained better. But he still holds to his party's crabbed reading of New York's muddy election law, which his lawyers used to fight fiercely to disenfranchise hundreds of registered voters for procedural mistakes, like voting in the wrong election district at the right polling place.\n        We are glad that the Court of Appeals decided otherwise, with a clear ruling that the benefit of the doubt belongs to the voters, not to political parties or partisan judges. That is a message that the newly attentive Mr. Spano -- as well as his colleagues in the Legislature, and the governor -- need to heed.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1738760,"ids":1738760,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Senator Pete Domenici told a recent gathering of experts that if Congress is going to do anything useful this year about the two big energy-related questions of our time -- oil dependency and global warming -- it will have to focus on ''four or five big things'' instead of the usual laundry list of tax breaks, subsidies and modest research programs.\n        A New Mexico Republican who runs the Senate energy committee, Mr. Domenici has become something of a Senate visionary on energy policy. With Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat, he co-sponsored a resolution that not only accepted the basic science of global warming but also endorsed mandatory controls on emissions of carbon dioxide. The realist in him knows that this Congress is unlikely to take either of the steps (much less both) that would be most likely to lower oil consumption as well as greenhouse gases: a big increase in fuel economy standards and a big gasoline tax.\n        But he is willing to entertain other incentives to produce fuel-efficient cars, to develop fuels other than gasoline -- most likely ethanol, not just from corn but from other crops -- and to build a new generation of power plants capable of capturing carbon dioxide before it goes into the atmosphere. Mr. Domenici's vision of the future also includes safer, less expensive nuclear plants, which have the virtue of generating no greenhouse gases.\n        There are several legislative vehicles at hand for achieving some of these objectives. One is the Fuel Choices for American Security Act of 2005. There are identical versions in both houses, each with broadly bipartisan sponsorship, including conservatives who would normally resist federal mandates but who believe that reducing oil consumption is an urgent matter of national security.\n        The bill would establish a goal for fuel savings of 2.5 million barrels a day (about what we now import from the Persian Gulf), increasing to 7.5 million barrels by 2025. It would also provide some of the means to get there, including serious production incentives for a new generation of cars and fuels.\n        Although the bill does not address other imperatives, like cleaner power plants, it would have a positive spillover effect on global warming because fuel-efficient cars and trucks would produce lower greenhouse gases. The question is whether Congress can focus on the big issues without engaging in the diversionary food fights that every energy bill seems to inspire.\n        It will be hard for someone not to raise red flags like drilling in the Arctic, or for Congress in general not to indulge its appetite for pork. But with even President Bush signing on (at least in speeches) to the need for a new energy future, this is not the time for business as usual.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1719547,"ids":1719547,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Shortly before the last election, a former rector at All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, Calif., gave a fiery antipoverty and antiwar sermon. He did not endorse a presidential candidate, but he criticized President Bush's policies in Iraq and at home. Now the Internal Revenue Service has challenged the church's tax-exempt status. It's important to know just how the tax police have chosen this church -- and other congregations -- to pursue after an election that energized churchgoers of most denominations.\n        I.R.S. officials have said about 20 churches are being investigated for activities across the political spectrum that could jeopardize their tax status. The agency is barred by law from revealing which churches, but officials have said these targets were chosen by a team of civil servants, not political appointees, at the Treasury Department. The I.R.S. argues that freedom of religion does not grant freedom from taxes if churches engage in politics.\n        That should mean that the 2004 presidential campaign would be an extremely fertile field. While some churches allowed Democrats to speak from the pulpit, the conservative Christians last year mounted an especially intense -- and successful -- drive to keep President Bush in office. Some issued voter guides that pointedly showed how their own religion was allied with Mr. Bush's views. Several Roman Catholic bishops even suggested that a vote for John Kerry would be a mortal sin. Since the election, Republicans have held two openly political nationally televised revival meetings at churches to support Mr. Bush's judicial nominations.\n        If the I.R.S. is pursuing any of those churches, we certainly have not heard from them about it. All Saints in Pasadena has released copies of the letter from the I.R.S., along with tapes of the sermon and a defense of the church's antiwar mission going back to the days when church leaders protested internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. The I.R.S. letter stated that the agency had ''concerns'' about a sermon by the Rev. George Regas that The Los Angeles Times called ''a searing indictment of the Bush administration's policies in Iraq.''\n        Church leaders have hired lawyers and refused to agree to a settlement that requires them to admit that the sermon was over the line drawn by the I.R.S. The Rev. J. Edwin Bacon, the rector of All Saints, told parishioners that the church would continue to resist the government's efforts. That sounds right. With the feverish courting of religious voters these days, the I.R.S. does have the daunting task of separating politics from church policy. Still, it would seem to be hard to justify picking on a church that has a long record of opposition to wars waged by leaders from both parties.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1823824,"ids":1823824,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Should Congress require any further reason to move aggressively to limit greenhouse gas emissions, it need only read Friday's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's authoritative voice on global warming.\n        A distillation of the best peer-reviewed science, the report expresses more than 90 percent certainty that man-made emissions from the burning of fossil fuels have caused the steady rise in atmospheric temperatures, with the destruction of tropical rain forests playing a lesser but important role.\n        The report warns that if society keeps to its current course, emissions will increase to twice their preindustrial levels by the end of this century, causing temperatures to rise 3.5 to 8 degrees. The consequences will include rising seas, more powerful hurricanes, disappearing coral reefs and more intensive droughts in subtropical countries.\n        The report also offers hope, suggesting that what humans have caused, humans can mitigate; that even though the world is committed to centuries of further warming, the process can be slowed and the worst effects averted by swift and decisive action to limit and reverse emissions.\n        This is the fourth in a series of studies that began in 1990. The first left open the possibility that the warming that began with the onset of the Industrial Revolution and increased in the 1950s was ''largely due to natural variability.'' The second and third reports detected a bigger human role, and this one lays the whole problem at humanity's doorstep.\n        A later paper will address specific remedies. But many climate experts believe the world must embark on a swift and sustained shift in the way energy is produced and used -- away from fuels like oil and coal, and toward cleaner alternatives.\n        That is the objective of the many global warming bills now circulating in Washington. The best of these would put a price on carbon through a mandatory cap on emissions from sources like power plants and cars, thus making coal and oil relatively more expensive while driving the market toward cleaner sources of energy.\n        As we have learned over the years, talk is cheap in Washington, while meaningful action is almost certain to be expensive. President Bush has brandished those very real costs of moving to a new energy-delivery system again and again to argue against mandatory caps on emissions and to make the case for his own cost-free (and demonstrably inadequate) program of voluntary reductions.

The answer presumably is a bit of both. Yet the current fee-for-service reimbursement systems used by Medicare and other insurance programs perversely reward doctors for the volume of services they provide and pay little or no attention to the quality of those services.\n        Indeed, a doctor who botches a surgical procedure, diagnostic test or drug prescription and then has to follow up with corrective action actually profits from his mistake. He gets paid for the botch-up and then again for mitigating the mistake.\n        Thus it is salutary that the last Congress, in its waning days, passed legislation that takes a modest step toward the goal of paying doctors based on the quality of their treatment. It authorizes Medicare to pay doctors a small bonus if they voluntarily report data on the quality of their care, like whether they prescribe recommended medications to heart attack victims or examine the feet of diabetic patients. If Congress decides to move the program forward, such data might in time be used to reward doctors who practice the best medicine.\n        Even this first step had some critics accusing Congress of trying to impose federally regulated ''cookbook'' medicine. But the notion of pegging reimbursement to performance has strong support from leaders in clinical and academic medicine, provided it is done carefully and in collaboration with credible experts who know good medicine from bad when they see it.\n        More than 100 pay-for-performance programs already exist, sponsored by health plans, employer groups and Medicare. Many take a graded approach: first paying doctors to report treatment data, then paying extra if they follow professionally derived standards of care, and finally paying more if they achieve successful outcomes -- measured, for example, by patient satisfaction or by keeping people healthy enough to avoid hospitalization.\n        Patient advocacy groups like AARP and the Medicare Rights Center favor the approach. Some medical societies, like those representing anesthesiologists and thoracic surgeons, have been working on their own quality standards. A 2004 poll found that a large majority of practicing physicians supported payments based on quality of care.\n        There is a clear need to improve the quality of care in a medical system that -- despite excellence at the very highest levels -- permits an alarmingly high rate of medical errors that harm tens of thousands of patients and drive up costs substantially.

The Bush administration has fought attempts to keep these deadly chemicals out of Washington. Now, the Department of Homeland Security is proposing a weak alternative that would let the shipments continue but put lights, cameras and chemical detectors along the route. This plan -- which critics have dubbed ''lights, camera, inaction'' -- puts the railroad and chemical industries' convenience and bottom lines ahead of the safety of everyone who lives or works in the city.\n        One of the deadliest terrorist attacks experts can think of would involve a 90-ton rail tanker filled with chlorine in a densely populated area. In less than an hour, as many as 100,000 people could be killed or injured. In Washington, a truck bomb set off under the bridge at Second Street and E Street SW, just as a chlorine tanker passed, would endanger everyone in Congress and the Supreme Court, and many other residents and workers.\n        The District of Columbia passed a law to keep out shipments of deadly chemicals, which are generally headed elsewhere. But railroads oppose the ban, which would raise shipping costs by modestly lengthening the route chemicals travel. CSX, the main railroad involved, persuaded a federal court to block the law from taking effect.\n        The Department of Homeland Security should develop a comprehensive national plan to keep deadly chemical shipments, to the extent possible, out of places that are likely targets. Instead, it proposes to protect a 7.5-mile stretch of rail line running through Washington with a ''virtual security corridor.'' At a cost of nearly $10 million, it would include video surveillance, high-intensity lights and detectors to report a toxic release. This isn't good enough. A well-orchestrated attack on a rail tanker would likely be over before officials could react to cameras or detectors.\n        The Bush administration talks tough about domestic security, but when reasonable safety measures clash with the interests of big industries, it goes soft.

Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the new Pope Benedict XVI, worked in close partnership with his predecessor and shared a belief in staunchly defending orthodox Catholic doctrine. There is no reason to expect any change, of course, for the church when it comes to matters like birth control, priestly celibacy or homosexuality. Those are issues of faith, properly left to the faithful. On matters of public policy, however, all of us have reason to be concerned about the opinions of the leader of more than one billion Catholics.\n        For instance, as a cardinal, the new pope inserted himself last year into the political debate over allowing Turkey into the European Union. He was quoted as saying that adding Turkey, a predominantly Muslim nation of 70 million people, would dilute the culture of what he considers a Christian continent and that Turkey should align itself instead with other Muslim nations. At a time when few things are more important than reconciling the Islamic world with the non-Islamic West, it would be extremely disturbing if the pope became an unnecessary wedge. It would also be out of keeping with the heritage of John Paul II -- who, for all his doctrinal conservatism, was a man known for his outreach to people of other faiths.\n        Like his predecessor, Benedict XVI is not Italian, but he continues the age-old tradition of European popes at a time when the church's membership is increasingly outside Europe. Its future appears to lie in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in the developing countries of Asia and Africa, where Pope John Paul II was so beloved for his warm, fatherly personality.\n        At least as a cardinal, Benedict XVI was more courtly than charismatic. He is an accomplished polyglot who is said to speak 10 languages, a theologian of great stature and a man who has had an academic as well as an ecclesiastical career. Anyone who heard his homage at the late pope's funeral had to have been impressed by his eloquence and devotion to John Paul. It is possible that the cardinals who picked him hoped he would protect the church's core from doctrinal corruption at a time when more and more of the faithful live in places where congregations are used to adapting their religions to reflect local customs and beliefs.\n        The new pope is, at 78, not likely to serve long enough to have the kind of impact his predecessor had. But the church has seen men elected as supposedly transitional figures in the past turn into agents for sweeping change. The beloved Pope John XXIII was a recent example. And in an era as fraught with peril as today's, anyone who occupies the throne of St. Peter is given overwhelming power to do good and responsibility to prevent harm. Today, the world can only wish Pope Benedict XVI strength and inspiration as he takes on this extraordinary burden of spiritual, moral and political leadership.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1651764,"ids":1651764,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Since its beginnings more than three decades ago, public television has served its audience best as an independent, creative medium, and its goal has been to avoid political and commercial taint. Now, the Public Broadcasting Service, that loose network of 349 public stations, is under assault politically and economically. The need for money to pay for expensive shows has driven it to sell commercial time, and as a result, each year offers less relief from the noisy commercialism on other channels.\n        Even more troubling, the conservatives in Congress and the White House have apparently decided that independence is O.K. only as long as the programming doesn't stray from their political ideology. Since the federal government provides 15 to 20 percent of the budget for public broadcasting, Washington's heavy hand -- which comes crashing down with petty and even ludicrous complaints -- threatens to choke the creativity out of PBS.\n        Let's be direct: PBS is hardly the Mount Olympus it once was. With the cable explosion, public television is no longer the only source of what was once labeled ''educational television,'' nor of more serious-minded documentaries, cultural and current-events programming. And as ultraconservatives and bottom liners circle, PBS appears to be too accommodating in response. When conservatives attacked the respected Bill Moyers, labeling him a dangerous liberal, PBS offered Tucker Carlson and Paul Gigot. Whatever slight liberal flavor might be dug out of the Moyers broadcasts, those are openly ideological conservative editorialists. Will they do investigations like Mr. Moyers? Will they dig beneath the large, loud surface of TV punditry? If not, how, please, is PBS different from MSNBC?\n        When conservatives sputtered about the program in which Buster, a cartoon bunny rabbit, met a gay couple in his travels across America, PBS dropped the segment. For those concerned that a documentary had United States soldiers using foul words, PBS offered its affiliates a sanitized version that several critics labeled the ''War is heck'' show. And bowing to the popularity of HBO, PBS is planning to offer some of the paid-channel's programs, expletives deleted of course.\n        With all these difficulties, PBS and its very independent affiliates still offer some of the best shows around. ''The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' is intelligent, civilized discourse on the day's issues. ''Nova,'' ''Frontline'' and ''Masterpiece Theater'' still deserve their stars, and ''Sesame Street'' remains the network's apple pie.\n        The challenge is to keep public television not merely alive but vibrant. If this Congress and president make their political mark on PBS, what's to stop the next president from doing the same? Politicians should not be allowed to trim public broadcasting to their liking.\n        The best long-term proposal would be to use funds from the eventual sale of the broadcast spectrum to establish a trust fund for the system. Some critics have argued that a trust fund offers too much independence from political overseers. But the far-sighted in every political camp should recognize that a little more financial independence is precisely what public broadcasting needs.","adu_anecdote":14,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1716223,"ids":1716223,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Since this page endorsed Michael Bloomberg's re-election as mayor, we're obviously glad that New York City voters agreed. But to be honest, we'd have been even happier with a narrower margin of victory. Big wins do not always lead to better government, and Mr. Bloomberg -- who has never specialized in openness -- should not take this lopsided triumph as a mandate to insist on his way, no matter what. He need look no further than the White House for an object lesson on how quickly things can sour in a second term run from inside a bubble.\n        Yesterday's election was certainly a vote of confidence for Mr. Bloomberg's efficient management and evenhanded, basically nonpartisan, administration. Most New Yorkers who voted for him would be perfectly happy with four more years of the same: lower crime, fiscal responsibility, quality of life initiatives and an intense focus on improving the city's schools.\n        But we expect the mayor to aim higher. The troubled plans for Lower Manhattan are in need of his guiding hand. We also hope he couples his commendable efforts to expand affordable housing and programs for the homeless with a full-bore assault on hunger among New York's poor.\n        In our endorsement, we said that Mr. Bloomberg could one day rank among the city's greatest mayors. The defect that threatens to overshadow all the good he has accomplished is the obscene amount of money he has spent on this re-election effort. Using his personal fortune, Mr. Bloomberg undermined the city's model campaign-finance system and turned what was never a very competitive race into a depressing rout. He'd have done better to heed the old John Kennedy line about the irrationality of paying for a landslide.\n        There is no way that Mayor Bloomberg will be able to avoid going down in the record books as the man who spent a fortune to win a municipal election -- his campaign may have cost more than $75 million. But he could devote part of his second term to making amends. The campaign finance laws need protection from the special interests that want to expand their own influence, as well as limits on the contributions of those doing business with the city. Now that Mr. Bloomberg can no longer be affected by these rules, he is in an excellent position to promote reform.\n        Mr. Bloomberg's Democratic opponent, Fernando Ferrer, deserves praise for running an honorable campaign and never giving up a fight in which he was ridiculously outmatched in spending and always trailing out of reach in the polls. But last night was Mr. Bloomberg's. If he uses this new opportunity as responsibly as he has governed for the last four years, the victory will be New York City's.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1697367,"ids":1697367,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"So much for that corporate tax holiday's acting as a job creation stimulus.\n        A month ago, Hewlett-Packard announced it would lay off 14,500 workers by November 2006. Meanwhile, the company is about to repatriate $14.5 billion in profits it has in overseas accounts at a measly tax of 5.25 percent -- an 85 percent discount off the normal corporate rate. The cut-rate repatriation, offered by Congress to American companies that bring profits held in foreign lands home in 2005, was sold to the public as a one-shot deal to generate cash for new hiring. But as its critics warned, the tax cut is functioning instead as a handout for America's most profitable companies.\n        Hewlett is just one example. Normally, the tax on a $14.5 billion repatriation would be about $5 billion. Because of the bargain rate in 2005, Hewlett expects to pay roughly $800 million. Hewlett also expects its layoffs to cost the company about $1 billion. Thus, in Hewlett's case, the tax holiday has not only failed to create jobs, but has also more than covered the cost of cutting workers from the payroll.\n        Dozens of other companies are also bringing billions home with no mention of new hiring. Pfizer, which plans to repatriate $36.9 billion, has, like Hewitt, announced layoffs. Pfizer hasn't said how many jobs it will cut, but analysts expect about 10,000. It also recently announced a multibillion-dollar stock buyback. Ditto for PepsiCo, which plans a $7.5 billion repatriation. Stock buybacks, which enrich shareholders by increasing earnings per share, are not approved as a direct use of repatriated funds. But Congress wrote the law in a way that gives companies broad flexibility in spending their money.\n        So the whole job creation thing was a fig leaf. The tax holiday is another big giveaway, courtesy of lawmakers who were overeager to please their corporate constituents and desperate for a shot of tax revenue after they'd blown a hole in the budget with excessive tax cuts for the rich. (The holiday is inflating tax revenue this year, but it is projected to reduce it in the future because companies will use the tax break in 2005 rather than repatriating profits at the normal rate later on.)\n        Worse still, the tax holiday legitimates the gaping loopholes that let American companies amass profits abroad in tax havens like Ireland, Bermuda, Luxembourg and Singapore. Meanwhile, employment growth is still well below historical norms, the federal budget languishes in the red, and deep cuts are being readied for government programs. If Congress were serious about tax fairness and raising revenue, it would close the loopholes, not reward the companies that exploit them.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1836888,"ids":1836888,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"So, remind us again why New York has to move next year's presidential primaries from March to Feb. 5? The stampede in Albany to shift the date ever earlier was advertised as a way for New York voters to get more attention from the candidates. But the odds are that New York voters will not have a chance to play a major role in choosing their party's nominee even with this change. That is partly because of the field of candidates, and partly because of the state's election rules.\n        Moving New York's primary forward would seem to have some superficial appeal. Rather than sit back and watch as places like Iowa and New Hampshire winnow the field, New Yorkers will be able to cast their ballots earlier in the process, on a day when many delegates will be up for grabs.\n        Voting earlier is not just about state pride. It is about making the candidates address New York's issues. The candidates always rave about ethanol in Iowa. If they had to hunt for votes in the Bronx and on Long Island, they might talk more about mass transportation and middle-income housing.\n        The problem with New York's slide forward, though, as Michael Cooper reported in The Times, is that it will still be an easy state for campaigns to skip. For starters, there are already home-team favorites -- Senator Hillary Clinton for the Democrats and former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for Republicans.\n        The more entrenched problem is New York's rules. In the Republican primary, the winner of the popular vote gets all the delegates. If Senator John McCain gets, say, 40 percent to Mr. Giuliani's 50 percent, he would win zero delegates. Given how expensive it is to run in New York, many candidates will probably not bother.\n        The Democrats' selection process is better but not much. Candidates are awarded delegates proportionately, but by Congressional districts. They must qualify for the ballot and meet vote thresholds, district by district. That gives a big advantage to candidates backed by the establishment.\n        Party primaries should be overhauled nationally into an organized system of regional primaries. But some of the problems are local. In New York, Gov. Eliot Spitzer, the Legislature and the parties should fix the state's arcane rules. Ballot access should be simplified, and delegates should be awarded based on shares of the statewide vote.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1658824,"ids":1658824,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Some court-watchers say Justice Antonin Scalia is on a ''charm offensive'' to become the next chief justice. Then he must have been taking the day off when he gave a speech last week and lashed out at the Supreme Court's recent ruling striking down the death penalty for juveniles, and at the idea of a ''living Constitution.'' There is nothing charming about his view that judges have no business considering the constitutionality of aspects of the death penalty, or that the Constitution should be frozen in time.\n        Justice Scalia dissented bitterly in this month's juvenile death penalty case. Reasonable minds may ask, as he did, whether the majority opinion relied too heavily on the norms of international law in deciding what punishment does not meet modern standards of decency. But Justice Scalia disagreed not merely with the majority's conclusion that offenders cannot be executed for crimes committed when they were under the age of 18, but with the very fact that the court was even considering the question. ''By what conceivable warrant can nine lawyers presume to be the authoritative conscience of the nation?'' he asked.\n        In his speech last week at the Woodrow Wilson Center, he continued on the same theme. He attacked the idea of a ''living Constitution,'' one that evolves with modern sensibilities, which the Supreme Court has long recognized in its jurisprudence, and of ''evolving notions of decency,'' a standard the court uses to interpret the Eighth Amendment prohibition on ''cruel and unusual punishments'' in cases like those involving the death penalty.\n        In drafting the Constitution, and particularly the Bill of Rights, the Founders chose to use broad phrases that necessarily require interpretation. Since its landmark 1803 ruling in Marbury v. Madison, the court has held that it is the final word on the Constitution's meaning. In the recent juvenile death penalty case, the court was doing its job of determining what one such phrase, ''cruel and unusual punishment,'' means today.\n        The implications of Justice Scalia's remarks are sweeping. Many of the most central principles of American constitutional law -- from the right to a court-appointed lawyer to the right to buy contraception -- have emerged from the court's evolving sense of the meaning of constitutional clauses. Justice Scalia seems to be suggesting that many, or perhaps all, of these rights should exist only at the whim of legislatures.\n        Justice Scalia may believe that by repeating his radical views enough times, the nation will grow accustomed to them. But his approach would mean throwing out much of the nation's existing constitutional law, and depriving Americans of basic rights. Justice Scalia's campaign to be the next chief justice, if it is that, is a timely reminder of why he would be a disastrous choice for the job.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1716224,"ids":1716224,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Some members of Congress appeared to be shocked to learn that oil companies would have record-setting profits this year, some $100 billion, collectively, for Exxon Mobil, BP Amoco, Royal Dutch Shell and ChevronTexaco. Soon they began thinking aloud about a windfall profit tax, with Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, saying that the oil companies had ''taken advantage of the trust of the American people.''\n        A windfall tax is a good idea. But justifying it by demonizing the oil companies only perpetuates Americans' false belief that high energy prices are primarily the fault of Big (Bad) Oil. They're mainly due to supply and demand, so consumers' insatiable oil thirst plays a major role. The oil companies are indeed reaping profits from hurricanes and other events, and a strong case can be made for taxing those windfalls. But outsized consumer demand made those external events so profitable.\n        To be effective, a windfall tax should be part of a strategy to reduce oil dependence. Such a strategy would depend on reducing consumption.\n        Top executives of the world's biggest oil companies will appear today at a Senate hearing. Lawmakers would be wise to stress why a windfall tax is both fair and necessary. In brief, for consumers, oil price increases are like a tax with no public benefit. Americans have deep national interests in reducing oil demand, but oil companies have little incentive to invest their windfall profits in ways that would advance those interests.\n        Properly structured, a windfall tax would generate money for mass transit and alternative fuels, for helping carmakers move from sport utility vehicles to energy-efficient models, and for other ways to cut demand. It would bring in so much money -- more than $24 billion this year, if it was set at 50 percent of the profits on oil sales above $40 a barrel in 2005 -- that some could also be used to help consumers cope with the current high prices, including providing a few billion dollars for home heating aid for the poor.\n        But using all of the revenue to provide consumer rebates -- as some lawmakers propose -- would be counterproductive because that would foster only more consumption.\n        The windfall tax would also make it easier for Congress to take the more difficult but necessary step of raising the federal gasoline tax. Money from the windfall tax could pay for the initial investments encouraging conservation. Then, as higher gasoline taxes took effect, some consumers would have alternatives to long commutes in gas guzzlers. When the windfall taxes dried up, the gasoline tax money would be available to continue investments in an oil-independent future.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1744436,"ids":1744436,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Some of the nation's biggest, most financially stressed airlines think they have found a great way to increase their profitability: make it harder for the consumer to determine the true cost of a ticket.\n        The airlines have asked the Department of Transportation to weaken its advertising rules so that they no longer have to quote the full fare for a trip but can split out and play down certain costs, like a surcharge for fuel, that will be added to the base price of a ticket. Customers deserve more transparency than this.\n        Under current practice, airlines are allowed to split out certain government-imposed fees and taxes from the quoted fare, provided that these fees are shown elsewhere in the advertisement, whether on the printed page or a computer screen, so that consumers can calculate the total price themselves. Now, as described in an article by Jeff Bailey and Christopher Elliott in The Times on Feb. 25, some airlines are proposing that they be allowed to delete additional costs that they impose themselves. At least one airline would like the department to junk its detailed advertising rules entirely. In all cases, the customer would have to be made aware of the total cost before the tickets are actually purchased, but not necessarily in time to make a measured purchasing decision.\n        The rationales for any change are ludicrously flimsy -- a presumption that consumers in the Internet age are more sophisticated and do not need as much protection, a belief that a deregulated industry no longer needs this vestige of regulation, and a desire by some airlines to have greater ''flexibility'' in designing their ads.\n        One does not have to be a cynic to expect bad behavior if the rules for airlines are weakened. Several low-fare airlines have warned that their higher-cost competitors might create a host of ''fictional surcharges,'' like fees to compensate for congestion or delays, which could be split out to make the fares look lower than they really are.\n        Some analysts suspect that this antiregulation administration may indeed weaken the rules. But one option under consideration would actually tighten the rules by making the airlines include even government fees and taxes in their advertised ticket prices. How fitting it would be, albeit hard to imagine, if the final result of this effort to gull the public were a regulation that insisted on full, prominent disclosure of the total price, with no exceptions.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1842181,"ids":1842181,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Some people refer to Long Island Sound as the Urban Sea, which by itself is enough to make you nervous. An estimated 20 million people live within a 50 mile drive of its shores, and centuries after the first European explorers came to trade with the Indians, people are still moving to the coasts, eating up open space, trampling wildlife habitats and paving over land in ways that reduce nature's capacity to filter and clean contaminated runoff.\n        The remarkable thing is that the Sound is doing as well as it is; though hemmed in by the densest population area in America, this 110-mile-long body of water has, against all odds, remained one of America's great estuaries. Water quality has improved, osprey and striped bass, among other species, have made dramatic recoveries.\n        But much remains to be done. Water quality in the Sound's urbanized western end remains only fair to poor; lobster harvests remain perilously low; some tidal marshes are turning into mud flats, for reasons not entirely clear; and water temperature is rising, distressing not only the lobsters but other fish species.\n        The main culprit, though not the only one, is nitrogen from urban and agricultural runoff and from the many municipal sewage treatment plants that empty their partially treated wastewater in the Sound and its tributaries. Nitrogen, useful as fertilizer on land, is fatal to water bodies, where it stimulates the growth of bacteria and algae and robs the water of oxygen.\n        In 1994, after considerable prodding from the federal Environmental Protection Agency, New York and Connecticut approved a comprehensive cleanup plan, and, in 1998, set a goal of reducing by 58.5 percent the nitrogen reaching the Sound from waste treatment plants in about 80 communities along the Sound and in New York City.\n        The results, so far, have been impressive -- a 25- to 30-percent reduction in nitrogen, roughly speaking, a figure that is sure to improve once an agreement struck last year between New York City and Albany to upgrade four plants along the East River kicks in. These plants produce nearly half the nitrogen that enters the Sound, and it is not stretching things to say that failure to live up to this agreement, which will cost the city at least $700 million, could ruin the entire effort.\n        Backsliding by the city would also gravely insult the local communities that, at considerable cost, have tried to reduce their own contribution to the problem. Norwalk and Stamford, Conn., have been particularly aggressive in upgrading their treatment plants. Westchester County, which was lagging, has become much more active.\n        Congress could also help. Two bills approved in recent years await full funding. One is the Long Island Sound Restoration Act, which authorizes $40 million a year over 5 years in matching grants to help modernize treatment plants. The other is the Long Island Sound Stewardship Act, which President Bush signed last October and which provides $25 million a year in matching funds for the acquisition of open space essential to the health of the Sound. Funding these programs would provide not only a financial but psychological boost to the local communities to whom the cleanup job has largely been entrusted.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1745747,"ids":1745747,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Some people who use the popular sleeping pill Ambien sure seem to be having bizarre experiences these days. The incidents they report range from middle-of-the-night telephone conversations that they don't remember the next morning to truly dangerous behavior that threatens harm to themselves or to others. Ambien has been implicated in enough automobile accidents that it has commanded the attention of top forensic scientists.\n        It is always possible that some of these people are just latching onto the latest excuse for misbehavior: ''The Ambien made me do it!'' But the evidence suggests that there is a core of cases in which Ambien played at least a contributing role in traffic accidents, often when taken with alcohol or other pills, or in too big a dose. The phenomenon of the ''Ambien driver'' was described in an article by Stephanie Saul in The Times on Wednesday.\n        Ambien, the nation's best-selling prescription sleeping pill, is taken by millions of Americans every year. Its side effects can include dizziness, difficulty with coordination and an amnesia in which people don't remember what has happened for several hours after taking the pill. Sleepwalking is a rare side effect.\n        The notion that Ambien may be contributing to traffic accidents is based on limited statistics and some compelling individual cases. In 10 laboratories that test drivers' blood samples for states, Ambien is listed among the top 10 drugs found in impaired drivers. In the state of Washington, Ambien was judged a factor in 78 impaired-driver arrests last year, up from 56 the year before. Several bizarre cases from Wisconsin were discussed at a meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences last month.\n        Nor is driving the only issue. An earlier article by Ms. Saul cited the case of a lawyer who said that in his first month of taking Ambien, he had torn a towel rack out of the wall during the night but had no memory of it the next morning. Other users say they have walked in their sleep, had conversations, fallen and injured themselves, driven somewhere and back, and even dented a car without recalling it the next day. They were typically informed by others.\n        At this point it is not clear whether these incidents are the tip of a serious health problem or very rare. Nor is it known how much blame can be heaped on Ambien as opposed to some underlying sleep disorder, or how much of the problem simply reflects reckless misuse of a drug that should not be taken with alcohol.\n        The manufacturer says 13 years of use show that the drug is safe when taken as directed. The Food and Drug Administration needs to determine whether Ambien-related sleepwalking or sleep-driving is serious enough to warrant a stronger warning label or other regulatory action.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1663701,"ids":1663701,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Somehow, somewhere, Westchester Medical Center must get an immense cash transfusion or face the nightmarish prospect of bankruptcy. Operation Cure, its latest and most awkwardly titled recovery plan, maps a route to stability that relies on an annual $20 million each from the county, state and federal governments, $20 million in union concessions and $20 million in cost savings.\n        Westchester added its part to this hypothetical river of revenue last week, with an announcement by the county executive, Andrew J. Spano, that the county would refinance bonds that it had sold in 1999 to cash in on the national settlement with tobacco makers. The windfall for the hospital is $27 million to start, and $4 million or more each year after that.\n        This is perhaps not the place to argue the merits of ''securitizing'' the tobacco money, a scheme by which local governments everywhere gained a quick budget fix by selling bonds whose interest and principal were to be covered by future infusions of tobacco cash. As any lottery winner can tell you, lump sums up front can be irresistible compared with slow payouts over time. And reborrowing at today's favorable rates makes sense, we suppose, if you believe that the borrowing was smart in the first place.\n        But it would have been nice if Mr. Spano -- whose press release says five times in four pages that the scheme poses no burden to taxpayers -- would acknowledge that sacrificing millions in future tobacco revenue to bond investors and underwriters could be seen as just as another version of a tax increase. No matter. The medical center needs money, it cannot be allowed to fail, and it is possible to twist oneself into rationalizing this use of tobacco money for this emergency. The settlement was supposed to be used to help counter the ravages of cigarettes, after all, and the medical center is certainly one place to do that.\n        Where is the rest of the money coming from?\n        In Albany, Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky and State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, not to be outdone by the other Mr. Spano, are working on sending recurring revenue the hospital's way, and with the distraction of the state budget process now gone, their odds of success seem good.\n        Other avenues seem less promising. The unions might be bled some more, but $20 million from them already seems like a stretch. Gov. George Pataki has consistently rejected proposals to divert sales tax revenue to the medical center, though this has not kept Andrew Spano from hoping the Legislature will extend a one-eighth percent sales tax in counties in the Hudson Valley, with the money going to the center and other regional hospitals. The county executive is free to keep pushing his we're-all-in-this-together argument, though no one outside Westchester seems to be buying it, for obvious reasons.\n        Because none of these schemes is a sure thing, Operation Cure still comes up way short, but it's some distance from where it was. As long as Mr. Spano and Mr. Spano, and others, remain on the case, the hospital's hopes for long-term survival remain alive. Death, in this case, is not an option.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1793943,"ids":1793943,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Sometimes New York State's $100 billion-plus budget seems a little like Albany's own Treasure Island.

These secret pools of slush are known, most commonly, as member items.\n        After heavy pressure from journalists and a few politicians recently, legislative leaders -- Joseph Bruno in the Senate and Sheldon Silver in the Assembly -- have begun providing a few details.

Without a Senate password, it is hard to sort the data by county or ZIP code to figure out which area got the most. ''It may not be wrapped up for you in a tidy little package,'' John McCardle, Mr. Bruno's spokesman said. ''But it's public.''\n        The Assembly also avoids connecting members with the giveaways, but it at least put out its list of grants in a way that can be more easily scanned and sorted. It is at www.assembly.state.ny.us\/comm\/WAM\/2006LegInit\/. And Common Cause New York has managed to make some sense of the Assembly and Senate data on its Web site: www.commoncause.org\/ny.\n        Legislators have long argued that member items go to good causes. And many items do seem reasonable -- funds for centers for the elderly or public colleges. But as the press and public dig deeper -- as The Times Union in Albany did recently with a catchall education fund -- we begin to understand why leaders want to keep this stuff secret.\n        For instance, the newspaper found a lot of public money going to private or parochial schools, to profit-making institutions and to religious organizations.

Dig here, under a mountain of paper, or excavate there, behind big closed doors, and -- eureka -- suddenly there are hundreds of millions of extra dollars for state leaders to hand out like gold doubloons to the districts of favored legislators. Insiders have a lot of names for these secret pools of slush: member items, bullet aid (as in shooting a bullet of cash to somebody's favorite cause) and GLOP, short for General Legislative Operations Programs.\n        After heavy pressure from journalists and a few politicians recently, Governor George Pataki and legislative leaders -- Joseph Bruno in the Senate and Sheldon Silver in the Assembly -- have begun providing a few details. We now know who got some of these items. What we don't know is who gave them. Data released by the Senate -- at www.senate.state.ny.us\/sws\/2006cpf\/senatecpf06.pdf -- lists almost 3,500 grants. Without a Senate password, it is hard to sort the data by county or ZIP code to figure out which area got the most. ''It may not be wrapped up for you in a tidy little package,'' Mr. Bruno's spokesman said. ''But it's public.''\n        The Assembly also avoids connecting members with the giveaways, but it at least put out its list of grants in a way that can be more easily scanned and sorted. It is at www.assembly.state.ny.us\/comm\/WAM\/2006LegInit\/. And Common Cause New York has managed to make some sense of the data on its Web site: www.commoncause.org\/ny.\n        Legislators have long argued that even if the process is a little dicey, member items go to good causes. And at first glance, many items seem reasonable -- funds for centers for the elderly or public colleges. But as the press and public dig deeper -- as The Times Union in Albany did recently with a GLOP education fund -- we begin to understand why leaders want to keep this stuff secret.\n        For instance, the newspaper found a great deal of public money going to private or parochial schools, to profit-making institutions and to religious organizations.

Such a moment has arrived in Albany. The matter at hand is reforming the way Albany does business. All the key players are in alignment. Gov. Eliot Spitzer, still riding his electoral landslide, promises a new day in Albany. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat like Mr. Spitzer, says that his half of the Legislature is ready, again, to vote on many desperately-needed reforms. And Senator Joseph Bruno, the Republican leader of the other half, finds himself in trouble with investigators and thus in dire need of a few positive headlines.\n        There is another reason Mr. Bruno might be more willing than usual to entertain real reform. His control over the State Senate threatens to narrow to 32 Republicans and 29 Democrats if a Democrat wins in a special election Feb. 6 on Long Island. And one of the top issues in that race between Craig Johnson, the Democrat, and Maureen O'Connell, the Republican, is government reform.\n        Thus, last week, Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver stood side-by-side to announce ''sweeping reforms'' of the way the state budget is put together. Among the proposed improvements is a requirement that henceforth all lump-sum payments for pet projects in members' districts be itemized in the budget, thus exposing them to public view. Until a recent court ruling requiring disclosure, these so-called ''member items,'' amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, have been shrouded in mystery.\n        The reforms would also require the Legislature to enact a balanced budget. As things stand now, only the governor's proposed budget has to be in balance; the legislators are free to throw the whole thing out of whack through amendments. The reforms would oblige the legislators to explain the budgetary impact of their amendments. It would also ask the governor to explain how his budget affects local governments.\n        Finally, the proposals would give the state comptroller the authority to resolve disputes over how much revenue is available to the state, which should make it a lot easier for lawmakers to adopt a budget on time by April 1.\n        These changes are not enough, of course. There should be an independent budget office, like New York City's. There should be a later deadline for the budget -- probably July 1 instead of April 1 to make it easier to assess tax revenues. And New York should move to the best-available budgeting system, using what are known as generally accepted accounting principles.\n        Still, to see state leaders standing together to announce these budget reforms is a lot better than the usual grumbling at separate news conferences. The trick will be for them to pass these changes quickly, preferably over the next two weeks while all three are more or less on the same page.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1690826,"ids":1690826,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Somewhere in the ill-conceived campaign to ''take back the memorial'' at ground zero, false impressions have managed to triumph over facts. This week, Debra Burlingame, a board member of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, and others called for a boycott of fund-raising for the memorial until the International Freedom Center and the Drawing Center have been banished from ground zero. She argues that money for the memorial will be intermingled with funds for the cultural building that is supposed to house the Freedom Center and the Drawing Center. This is both misleading and harmful to the memorial itself. The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation has pledged that its first priority is to build the memorial and create an endowment for it. Private donors are free to specify how they choose to have their money spent.\n        The attacks on the International Freedom Center -- and, more broadly, on the cultural component of Daniel Libeskind's master plan -- make it all too easy to forget the existence of a Memorial Museum that is devoted wholly to the events of 9\/11. Opponents of the Freedom Center, like Ms. Burlingame, claim that the Memorial Museum will be dwarfed by the cultural center. In fact, they overstate the size of the Snohetta building, which is being scaled back for other reasons, and they have exaggerated the floor space allotted there for the International Freedom Center. They also make it sound as if the Memorial Museum, which at 50,000 square feet is larger than the public spaces in the Whitney Museum, is somehow an afterthought relegated to the basement. It will be built underground, but that is because the 9\/11 families asked to have access to the bedrock and to what remains of the foundation of the twin towers. To argue over the size of these two spaces is to assume that emotional power is solely the result of square footage. It is also to forget the profound effect that going to the roots of the World Trade Center will have on most visitors.\n        But this is not really a campaign about money or space. It is a campaign about political purity -- about how people remember 9\/11 and about how we choose to read its aftermath, including the Iraq war. On their Web site, www.takebackthememorial.org, critics of the cultural plan at ground zero offer a resolution called Campaign America. It says that ground zero must contain no facilities ''that house controversial debate, dialogue, artistic impressions, or exhibits referring to extraneous historical events.'' This, to us, sounds un-American.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1744408,"ids":1744408,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Somewhere on the second floor of New York's gloomy State Capitol, there are stacks of documents relating to Gov. George Pataki's 12 years in office. The papers and e-mail messages range from the governor's proposals for cutting taxes to his own personal files and diaries.\n        The personal files usually stay under lock and key until a governor hands them over to a favorite library, with instructions on who should see them and when. The public documents are a different matter. Most states and the federal government require that at some point such documents be made available to the public archives. New York does not, which means the public has no automatic right to basic records of how policy affecting the state's 19 million residents was actually made.\n        The problem extends to the Legislature as well. Archivists have no automatic right to important legislative material. In short, if Albany's present workings seem murky, the past is often a black hole.\n        Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, a Democrat from Buffalo, has made this issue a personal mission for more than a decade, and he has repeatedly offered legislation that would make it easier to obtain important policy papers once governors leave office. Republicans in the Senate, presumably awaiting Mr. Pataki's approval, have continued to send Mr. Hoyt's bill into the legislative recycling bin.\n        The Hoyt bill is a good start that deserves the support of both the Senate and the governor. The bill would require the governor's office to protect and produce records in line with the standards of the National Archives. At the end of a governor's term, state archivists would assume control of those documents deemed to be historically important -- perhaps 2 percent of all the paper and e-mail generated by the office over the years. These papers would be owned by the state and the archivist would be obliged to make them public ''as soon as possible.'' The bill's main weakness is that it does not authorize the archives to obtain similarly important documents generated by leaders in the Assembly and the Senate.\n        Without any requirement in law, it's not clear how Mr. Pataki will proceed. Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani triggered a public outcry when he asked a private group to examine his records; critics suspected that anything that did not enhance his image would be discarded. The mayor finally turned the documents over to the city's archives.\n        The state archives already contain the papers of some governors, received as gifts or by persuasion. The public papers of New York's first governor, George Clinton, are there (his personal documents are in the state library), as are Al Smith's and the records of Franklin Roosevelt's Albany years, passed along by his presidential librarians.\n        Mr. Pataki and the archivists should begin to determine what to make available. If his private papers are going to be culled -- those notes from President Bush, for instance -- he should choose a library in the state to send them to. More broadly, he can set a high standard for how his successors bequeath their official records to history.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1827988,"ids":1827988,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Spin it any way you like, Prime Minister Tony Blair's announcement that Britain will be withdrawing up to 1,600 of its 7,100 remaining troops in Iraq can't be welcome military or political news for President Bush.\n        This isn't the first reduction in the British contingent, which originally numbered 40,000. But it comes at a time of spiraling violence in Iraq and emboldened opposition in Washington to Mr. Bush's disastrous war. It also comes as Mr. Blair is preparing to leave office, painfully aware that popular fury over the war threatens to overwhelm his entire legacy.\n        The British announcement has already served as the catalyst for other departures. Denmark, with 460 troops under British command, announced yesterday that it would leave by August. With the Pentagon already straining to find enough soldiers for Iraq, a troop drawdown by its most militarily capable ally can only add to the strain -- and to the clamor for bringing American forces home as well.\n        The White House strove to cast Mr. Blair's political necessity as a sign of ''some progress in Basra,'' Iraq's second-largest city, which British forces have had military responsibility for since the invasion. Vice President Dick Cheney -- even more disconnected from reality -- chimed in that the British pullback shows that there are some parts of Iraq where ''things are going pretty well.''\n        Mr. Blair knows better, and candidly acknowledged that Basra is not ''how we want it to be,'' but said that it was time for the Iraqis to write ''the next chapter in Basra's history.'' Mr. Blair also insisted that the situation there is ''very different from Baghdad,'' where, he said, an ''orgy of terrorism'' has been unleashed -- his out-the-door endorsement for President Bush's troop buildup in the capital.\n        But if there is comparatively more calm in Basra, that is only because the outnumbered British forces have ceded control to Shiite sectarian militias and local police forces controlled by rival armed factions.\n        Just two months ago, British and Iraqi soldiers stormed a Basra police station, rescuing 127 prisoners from what British officials said was almost certain execution. There is so far little evidence that Iraq's national armed forces on their own will be able to protect Basra's innocent civilians or even that they mean to try.\n        Whether it is Basra with fewer British troops or Baghdad with more Americans, nothing in Iraq is ''going pretty well.''\n        Editorial\n        Correction:  February 23, 2007, Friday  Because of a production error, passages in an Op-Ed article yesterday, about the British presence in Iraq, appeared out of order in some copies.

There has been plenty of political adding and subtracting in the General Assembly, especially by the minority Republicans. They proposed a budget of their own late last month -- and in so doing effectively abandoned their Republican leader, Gov. M. Jodi Rell.\n        Their plan would require no tax increase. The governor's plan would require an income tax increase while giving millions more to education.\n        Dropping any pretense of supporting Ms. Rell, Republican leaders would use the state budget surplus for continuing expenses. They are betting that the current good times on Wall Street will continue, and that revenues from the state's capital gains tax on stocks and dividends will rise.\n        The G.O.P. legislators insist that their numbers will work, pointing out that the Office of Fiscal Analysis, the nonpartisan budget arm of the General Assembly, has underestimated revenue growth for 11 out of 14 years. The Republicans believe it's safe to assume that the office's revenue predictions are too pessimistic for next year as well.\n        This is a very risky game. Between 7 and 9 percent of the budget comes from taxes on capital gains. Revenue from capital gains has fluctuated. It increased by 65 percent in 1997, for example, and dropped 42 percent in 2001. Predicting what the stock market will do is difficult at best.\n        Of course, the Republican budget is more about politics than dollars and cents; it is a calculated effort to portray the Republicans as responsible stewards of the public's money and the Democrats as irresponsible spendthrifts.\n        Actually, the Democrats are doing a pretty good job of that on their own, proposing to spend millions on health care while raising money with odd strategies like taxing funerals and clothing purchases of less than $50, which are now tax-exempt.\n        The Democrats insist that proposals like these merely reflect a larger, multistate effort to simplify sales taxes across state lines, with the eventual goal of taxing Internet purchases.\n        But when, in one breath, they contemptuously dismiss the governor's responsible plan to cap the growth of property taxes, and, in the next, propose taxes on everything from cosmetic surgery to coffins, they look exactly like the stereotypical liberals the Republicans want them to be.\n        Which, of course, makes the Republicans and their budget look better than they are.

As a result, their employees have extra incentive to show up for work even when they have the sniffles. As for vacations, well, does anybody really need more than a few days away from the office every year?\n        Recently, nearly two dozen members of the Sharpe James regime in Newark left office after cashing in $658,000 in unused sick and vacation days. Some of them walked away with five-figure packages as high as $85,000. The former mayor, who remains a state senator and who recently accepted a six-figure job at Essex County College, received a $36,000 package.\n        These abuses are by no means limited to Newark. State officials say, privately, that six-figure packages are not uncommon for longtime local government workers who made a point of rarely calling in sick or taking time off. In fact, several weeks ago a police chief in Parsippany received $469,000 for his unused vacation and sick days over 34 years.\n        These huge payments are in addition to the pensions the retired workers receive. Some of those pensions top $100,000 a year.\n        As Trenton continues to wrestle with the ever-expanding monster known as property taxes, it is important to bear in mind that local governments are more than mere spectators in this battle. Increased costs in county and municipal government are very much a part of the property tax problem.\n        Most local governments have refused to follow the state's example in capping the retirement payouts for unused sick and vacation time. A bill that would have required them to do so, introduced by State Senator Thomas Kean Jr. several years ago, went nowhere, thanks in part to opposition from some public employee unions.\n        Local governments across the state are being hit hard by pension costs that have greatly increased in recent years. Counties and towns will have to pay about $650 million in pension payments in the next fiscal year, an increase of $267 million. The outsize packages for unused days off only add to the fiscal distress.\n        If local governments will not act in the best interests of taxpayers, Trenton should take the initiative by imposing a cap on all unused sick days and vacation time.\n        It is wonderful that local government workers are willing to report to work even when they are not feeling 100 percent. But taxpayers should not be stuck with a huge bill to pay for that kind of dedication.\n        What's more, some of these hard-charging workers ought to remember that there is nothing wrong with spending a few vacation days at the shore every now and then.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1782493,"ids":1782493,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Steve Levy, the Suffolk county executive, has proposed a law to require every company and agency doing business with the county to file an affidavit each year certifying that its work force is 100 percent legitimate and contains no illegal immigrants. The law, which seems to have overwhelming support in the County Legislature, seems reasonable enough at first glance. But it becomes troubling when you ponder what Mr. Levy is trying to accomplish and what his motives are.\n        This page has no quarrel with Mr. Levy's assertion that employers and workers should play by the rules. It is important that employers not gain an unfair advantage by exploiting illegal immigrants willing to work in poor conditions for rock-bottom wages. But the proposed law needs to be viewed through the prism of Mr. Levy's fixation on immigration enforcement -- for example, his previous misguided attempt to deputize county police officers to enforce federal immigration laws -- and his courting of hard-core anti-immigration groups through a national organization he helped found.\n        Never mind that Mr. Levy's new law is a bit of a non sequitur, since the businesses that tend to hire illegal immigrants, like restaurants, delis and landscaping concerns, tend not to have county contracts. It is more disconcerting that he is trying to take the county into an area that is the purview of the federal government. It seems reasonable to ask why Suffolk would pursue such a redundant crackdown and where its responsibilities would logically end -- should contractors also have to file affidavits swearing that their employees follow federal laws on drug use? On filing tax returns?\n        If Mr. Levy wants a more law-abiding workplace, he can start by setting up hiring sites for day laborers in Suffolk County. By bringing the day-labor bazaar out into the open, these centers lift the shadows from the shadow economy and pressure employers to abide by wage, benefit and safety laws. If Mr. Levy wants to know who the deadbeat, law-flouting contractors are, he can contact organizations like the Workplace Project in Hempstead, which are well connected with Long Island's immigrant economy.\n        ''Most unions I talk to are concerned that their membership is being undercut by the illegal underground economy,'' Mr. Levy says. But he clearly has not talked lately to the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which last week announced an official partnership with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, the largest national association of immigrant worker centers. Union leaders have recognized that when contractors are held to account, violations fall and wages rise, and all workers -- foreign- and native-born -- benefit.\n        Mr. Levy is utterly correct to deplore the federal government's dithering refusal to restore the rule of law on immigration. But his solution, cracking the whip on local employers, is a small-bore idea, a nuisance intended to put out the unwelcome mat to the newcomers who are trying to make their way in Suffolk. It is vigilante governance, a one-note policy fueled by resentment and indignation, which can be dangerous in a county as prone to outbreaks of anti-immigrant hatred as Suffolk.\n        Mr. Levy should add a positive dimension to his law-and-order crusade. He should try to help immigrant workers, not drive them away or further underground.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1649695,"ids":1649695,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Steve Troxler is a tobacco farmer from Browns Summit, N.C.

Aside from being stockily built Republican family men, they do not seem to have much in common, except this: Both are the last candidates standing in close elections that took more than three months to decide because of debilitating, constitutionally dangerous -- and utterly fixable -- flaws in their states' electoral systems.\n        In New York, Mr. Spano's re-election as state senator hinged on a handful of paper ballots; no one could agree on whether to count them. His lawyers fought to reject them on technical grounds, fearing he would lose otherwise. As the case ping-ponged through the courts, an array of judges took a whack at interpreting New York election law, with no two rulings alike.\n        In North Carolina, Mr. Troxler's ascent to agriculture commissioner was stymied at first by thousands of votes that were impossible to count, because they had vanished into the electronic ether. A single electronic voting machine had lost 4,438 votes, more than the margin separating him from his opponent. With no paper trail, there was nothing to do but guess at the outcome.\n        When the democratic machinery broke down, partisan squabbling and confusion ruled. People in both states offered wacky solutions. Mr. Troxler persuaded 1,300 people to swear in affidavits that they had voted for him, thus proving, he insisted, that his victory was an arithmetic certainty. While this ad hoc approach deserves points for creativity, it shreds the principle of the secret ballot and invites voter coercion.\n        The Republican mayor of Yonkers, Philip Amicone, called for a new election because, he said, the close vote made the true winner unknowable. His agnostic gloom vanished once most of the contested ballots were counted and Mr. Spano won.\n        Both crises finally evaporated when Mr. Troxler's and Mr. Spano's opponents bowed to reality and conceded. In both states, voters' confidence seems bruised but not shattered by these torturous elections, because both men are plausible winners -- and the losers had the sense to throw in the legal towel.\n        There are ways to wring some good results from these bad elections. A legislative panel in Raleigh has urged that all voting machines generate paper records. Lawmakers there should quickly approve that proposal, but reject another that would allow contested elections to be decided by the state legislature.\n        In the Spano race, New York's highest court ruled that provisional ballots cast in the right polling place but wrong election district should count -- a victory for voters across the state. It should have gone further, ruling that provisional ballots are valid even if cast in the wrong polling place.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1642336,"ids":1642336,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Strontium-90, like most radioactive isotopes, is not something you want to brush your teeth with. It lurks in soil and groundwater and hides in bones and teeth, causing leukemia and other cancers.\n        This is why so much attention has been paid to two large plumes of strontium-90 that are creeping very slowly through the soil under Brookhaven National Laboratory. The lab, like most everything else on Long Island, sits atop the aquifer that is the island's only natural source of drinking water. The radioactive contamination is one of several lingering stains from Brookhaven's nuclear reactors, now closed, and local officials and community activists have fought hard to get the Energy Department, which runs Brookhaven, to clean it up.\n        It's slow work, given the nature of the contamination and the complicated, expensive means of removing it. And it may become slower still, because the Energy Department is asking for more time. It says that a project envisioned to last 30 years would be better off lasting 70.\n        Why? Under an agreement it reached in 2000 with the Environmental Protection Agency and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the lab has been operating an array of wells and pumps to remove tainted water, filter out the contaminants and return clean water to the ground. The trouble, project managers say, is that when tainted water flows through the filters too quickly, the filters become clogged with other minerals and impurities. They are changing filters far more often then they expected, and that's expensive.\n        It would be far better, the lab says, to slow the flow, save millions of dollars on filters -- and more than double the time the project will take. The public health threat is negligible to begin with, they say, because no one is drinking Brookhaven water anyway, and a delay will not make things worse. And given strontium-90's relatively short half-life of 29 years, the problem is getting better on its own.\n        We can accept these technical judgments by the folks at Brookhaven, just as we welcome their efforts to keep neighbors informed about the messes they have made. These involve not only leaks of strontium-90 but also of radioactive tritium and bothersome quantities of industrial chemicals that are another threat to groundwater.\n        But we side with the well-informed environmental groups that have kept a close eye on Brookhaven's troubles for years. They are willing to accommodate the lab to a certain extent on the strontium-90 cleanup, accepting the judgment that it might make sense to extend the 30-year project by another decade or so. But they insist, rightly, that there is no good reason to prolong the project so drastically just because it is stickier than expected and the federal government does not want to spend the money.\n        That could set a bad precedent for future cleanups at Brookhaven, which is going to be a dirty place for a long time. In 70 years, everyone arguing about this will probably be dead. That is too long to wait to restore the purity of a public resource as vital as Long Island's drinking water.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1813612,"ids":1813612,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Studies of prison inmates clearly show that keeping them in contact with friends and family is vital to giving them a chance to create an honest life after jail instead of committing new crimes that land them right back behind bars. Yet the simple act of picking up the phone to call home can be bankrupting for inmates and their families.\n        The cruel and counterproductive system now in place around the country charges them as much as six times the going rate for collect calls placed from inside state prisons. The collect-call service providers keep a stranglehold on the business by paying the state prisons a legalized kickback called a ''commission.''\n        These costs are borne by spouses, parents and other collect-call recipients who typically come from the country's poorest families. Worse still, these families can be barred from receiving a prisoner's collect call at all until they open costly accounts with the same companies that provide the prison phone service.\n        With bills that sometimes reach into the hundreds of dollars a month, families must often choose between talking to a jailed loved one and paying the rent. The lost contact is especially crushing for imprisoned parents, who make up more than half the national prison population and are often held in prisons hundreds of miles away from their children.\n        A bill that went nowhere in Congress this year would have mandated fair rates for interstate calls made from prison. The bill, introduced by Representative Bobby Rush, Democrat of Illinois, would also have required prisons to use both the collect-calling system and the less expensive debit-calling system. Used in federal prisons, debit calling lets inmates use computer-controlled accounts to pay for easily monitored calls to specified phone numbers.\n        The collect-call-only system is being challenged in court in a number of states, including New York, where a closely watched case is scheduled to be argued before the state's highest court in early January. The suit rightly argues that the telephone markup is a hidden levy on families who already support the prison system through their taxes.\n        State prison officials say the money is used to pay for programs that benefit inmates. But it also gouges the poorest citizens -- driving them deeper into poverty -- to pay for prison services that the state is obligated to provide. It might be legal, but it is also counterproductive and morally indefensible.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1796571,"ids":1796571,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Sudan's leaders sent out a letter last week warning governments against volunteering their troops for a United Nations peacekeeping force for Darfur.

The Iraq war and President Bush's with-us-or-against-us war on terrorism was supposed to frighten the bad guys so much that they wouldn't dare cross the United States. But the opposite has happened. President Bush has squandered so much of America's moral authority -- not to mention our military resources -- that efforts to shame or bully the right behavior from adversaries (and allies) sound hollow.\n        There is plenty of blame to go around when it comes to empowering rogue states. The Chinese have been shielding Sudan and North Korea. The Russians have been shielding Iran. Were it not for Iraq and Mr. Bush's other troubles, there would be ways to shame or bypass those roadblocks. When the Russians blocked U.N. action in Kosovo, President Clinton got NATO to stop the killing.\n        Mr. Bush appears to care deeply about Darfur. But the United States is so overstretched in Iraq that no one in this White House is even talking about sending NATO to stop ethnic cleansing that has already left more than 200,000 dead and displaced more than two million.\n        Closing our eyes for another two years isn't an answer. Washington needs to assert its leadership, no matter how tattered, on all these fronts.\n        We suspect that cargo inspections and a cutoff of military and luxury trade will not be enough to get North Korea to back down. But having started there, Mr. Bush now needs to tell China and Russia that all future relations will be judged on how they hold the North to account.\n        Beijing and Moscow would find it harder to say no if Mr. Bush made a clear pledge -- no caveats and no fingers crossed behind his back -- that he would not try to overthrow North Korea's government if it abandoned its nuclear weapons. Mr. Bush needs to make the same unambiguous offer to Iran. As for Darfur, Khartoum might feel less cocky if Mr. Bush announced that he was taking the lead on soliciting troops for a peacekeeping force while asking NATO to start drawing up plans for a possible forced entry should the United Nations fail to act.\n        In his news conference yesterday, Mr. Bush said that the abuses at Abu Ghraib ''hurt us internationally. It kind of eased us off the moral high ground.'' He quickly added that the world had seen the perpetrators held to account.\n        We fear it will take a lot more than the trials of a few low-level prison guards to repair the damage, whether from Abu Ghraib, Guant\u00e1namo, the secret prisons or the whole mismanaged Iraq war.

At least we think it does. Its system, if you can call it that, is unusual in the United States for a county its size: a patchwork quilt of volunteers in 99 separate and independent jurisdictions who respond to emergency calls whenever they are available.\n        When they are not -- as sometimes happens with men and women who have full-time jobs, families and other responsibilities -- emergency dispatchers bounce calls from one nearby community to another until a crew can be assembled.\n        That takes time. Sometimes, tragically, far too many minutes pass before a volunteer corps arrives at the scene of an accident or medical crisis. New York State records show that the average ambulance response time in Suffolk is several minutes slower than in Nassau and Westchester Counties. Whether that stems from balkanized emergency services, Suffolk's sheer size, its bad traffic, a reliance on primitive pencil-and-paper methods of receiving 911 calls or some combination of all of these factors, no one is really sure.\n        The reason, according to paramedics and county emergency officials, is that there is no comprehensive source of data on emergency calls to help the county determine how well the system works, where it is failing and how to make it better. Ambulance crews keep records of the calls they get from dispatchers, which are reported to New York State, analyzed, and released four or five years later. But compiling meaningfully accurate data on response times requires seeing the logs of local dispatchers, who are the first ones who get the stricken phone calls. These dispatchers are not obligated to share their records with anyone.\n        A Suffolk County legislator, David Bishop of Babylon, wants to do better. He submitted a bill in the last session of the county Legislature that would impose uniform standards of record keeping on every emergency call. Dispatchers would log the data on response times, which could then be assembled and submitted to computer analysis, in the same way that police departments examine crime statistics to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement. The bill was killed out of fear that information thus gained could increase the county's exposure to lawsuits and somehow jeopardize the all-volunteer system.\n        Detailed emergency response data from all the county's volunteer ambulance districts may reveal flaws, inefficiencies and embarrassments. But the information will certainly be instructive, and is likely to help save lives.\n        That is all the reason needed for the Legislature to revive and pass Mr. Bishop's bill in the coming weeks. Where there is information, there is accountability. In matters of life and death, the people of Suffolk deserve nothing less.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1653052,"ids":1653052,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Suffolk County is about six weeks into a 90-day experiment in modern policing. If you believe the anguished leaflets being distributed around Huntington by the county police union, we are on the brink of chaos in the streets.\n        The source of the rank and file's dismay is an effort by the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, and Police Commissioner Richard Dormer to reduce labor costs in the police department. Mr. Levy and Mr. Dormer have taken a couple of patrol cars off the lobster shift in the Second Precinct, which covers Huntington, and added them to the evening shift. They have given supervisors the discretion to send home officers working on overtime in the wee hours, if things are quiet.\n        They say these changes have done no harm to public safety while saving tens of thousands of dollars in night differential costs and overtime. If anything, they say, the redeployment has strengthened the police presence, by increasing patrols on the 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. shift, when the bad drivers and drunks are out. Does all this sound dreadful to you? To us it sounds extremely modest, as policing innovations go. But the Police Benevolent Association in Suffolk County is scared to death. It has used these developments to wage an all-out public attack on Mr. Levy, denouncing him with fliers, mocking T-shirts and a truck-mounted billboard that warns Huntington residents that their lives are in peril.\n        The real peril in Huntington is police union clout, in a county where officers have long been compensated extra-handsomely to keep the peace in already peaceful subdivisions. Yes, Suffolk has drugs, gangs, domestic violence and idiots who roll their S.U.V.'s, but Fort Apache it's not. Cops clamor to do their serving and protecting here, and the impressive salaries, union benefits and work environment have a lot to do with it.\n        It's unfortunate that P.B.A. leaders have chosen to use a fear-and-loathing attack strategy against an innocuous innovation at a time when the crime numbers in the county are good.\n        New York City's plunging crime rates -- replicated in high-crime areas around the country -- offer guidance here. The lesson is that police departments work best when they quickly shift resources to where the problems are. A lonely officer whiling away night after night at a desk or in a dark patrol car is not part of such a solution.\n        Mr. Dormer and his police force must be doing something right. The commissioner notes that crime is down -- it fell 9.2 percent last year, three times the statewide average -- that police response time is down and that foot patrols are up. Mr. Dormer, a 30-year veteran of the department, has won the right to try to improve on those numbers by deploying his resources more flexibly.\n        If the Suffolk P.B.A. has a problem with that strategy, it should wait until the 90-day trial is completed, then show us its own crime data and staffing numbers to bolster its case. Until then, inflammatory attacks and scary warnings -- and the T-shirts showing Mr. Levy as an organ grinder and Mr. Dormer as his monkey -- are utterly unhelpful.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1693488,"ids":1693488,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Summertime often produces unexpected media figures, and this is Cindy Sheehan's season. Ms. Sheehan, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq last year, is camping out near President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., and says she won't leave until Mr. Bush agrees to meet with her to discuss the war. There are many reasons for the flood of media attention she is attracting: she has a poignant personal story and she is articulate -- and, let's face it, August is a slow news month. But most of all, she is tapping into a growing popular feeling that the Bush administration is out of touch with the realities, and the costs, of the Iraq war.\n        Ms. Sheehan's 24-year-old son, Casey, was killed in Baghdad. She says she and her family met privately with Mr. Bush two months later, and she is sharply critical of how the president acted. He did not know her son's name, she says, acted as if the meeting was a party and called her ''Mom'' throughout, which she considered disrespectful.\n        Ms. Sheehan has traveled from her California home to Crawford, where Mr. Bush will be spending much of the month, in the hope of having a more substantive discussion. On Saturday, Mr. Bush's national security adviser and the White House deputy chief of staff met with her beside a road a few miles from the ranch, but she is still insisting on a meeting with the president.\n        Even many Americans who do not share her views about the president -- she arrived in a bus bearing the slogan ''Impeachment Tour'' -- share her concerns about his war leadership. President Bush has refused to ask the nation to sacrifice in any way, so the sacrifice gap has never been greater. A few families, like Ms. Sheehan's, have paid the ultimate price. Many more, including National Guard families, are bearing enormous burdens, struggling to get by while a parent, a child or a spouse serves in Iraq. But the rest of the nation is spending its tax cuts and guzzling gas as if there were no war.\n        Mr. Bush obviously failed to comfort Ms. Sheehan when he met with her and her family. More important, he has not helped the nation give fallen soldiers like Casey Sheehan the honor they deserve. The administration seems reluctant to have the president take part in events that would direct widespread attention to soldiers' funerals or to the thousands who have returned with serious injuries.\n        Perhaps most troubling, Mr. Bush is not leveling about where things stand with the war. He continues to stay on message, as he did with the platitude he offered last week: ''We will stay the course; we will complete the job in Iraq.'' The public knows that things in Iraq are not going well on any number of levels, and deserves a fuller, more honest discussion led by the commander in chief.\n        Just 38 percent of the respondents in a recent Associated Press-Ipsos poll, a new low, approved of Mr. Bush's handling of Iraq. That does not mean the remaining 62 percent agree with Ms. Sheehan that the troops should come home immediately. But it does mean that many Americans are with her, at least figuratively, at that dusty roadside in Crawford, expecting better answers.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":4,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1643657,"ids":1643657,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Supporters of President Jacques Chirac have introduced legislation that would make former presidents senators for life, which may sound like a nice solution to the universal problem of what to do with a former head of state. But this bad idea is really an attempt to shield Mr. Chirac from the corruption investigations that have swirled around him but never actually touched him.\n        Mr. Chirac, whose term ends in 2007, has distanced himself from the proposal, and in any case, it is a very long shot, since it would require a change in the French Constitution. But there is no question that the prospect of investigations and possible prosecutions is much on the mind of the 72-year-old president as he nears the end of a very long political career. The main focus of the investigations is corruption in the Paris region during Mr. Chirac's 18 years as mayor. Alain Jupp\u00e9, a former prime minister who had been regarded as Mr. Chirac's designated heir, was given a suspended sentence and banned from politics for a year after he was convicted last year of misusing public funds in the Paris City Hall.\n        There is talk that Mr. Chirac might run again, but if he does not, many French voters probably would like him to have an honorable retirement. He has, after all, been a fixture of French politics as far as anyone can remember. He got his first senior government post under Charles de Gaulle, was a minister under Georges Pompidou, prime minister under Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing and mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995. There is a good chance that whoever succeeds him will quietly try to drop the investigations against Mr. Chirac.\n        That's a moral dilemma the French leadership will have to resolve. But evading responsibility by giving Mr. Chirac a lifetime Senate seat would be a big mistake. The purpose of parliamentary immunity is to protect elected officials from politically motivated prosecution while they serve, not to put them above the law. Mr. Chirac's friends in the Senate would do their country a favor by dropping this foolish and offensive idea.\n        Correction:  January 27, 2005, Thursday  An editorial on Jan. 4 incorrectly described the American role in helping victims of the earthquake in Bam, Iran.

Or at least a sliver of it.\n        Last Sunday, Woody Hochswender wrote about the abundance of small farms in the region, not just in the Hudson Valley but throughout the exurban band encircling New York City between 50 and 100 miles out. About a month earlier, Anahad O'Connor wrote about coyotes. The region has lots of them, pouring down from the Adirondacks and parts west.\n        Other parts of the country may lament the encroaching deadness of auto-based landscapes, a world of impervious surfaces and shopping. But here, practically in the shadows of the nation's biggest city, echoes of the preindustrial age can still be heard. An older version of the United States is not only hanging on, but doing pretty well.\n        ''Urge and urge and urge, always the procreant urge of the world,'' Walt Whitman wrote. ''Always substance and increase.''\n        That maxim can apply to developers as much as to dandelions, of course. But the densely populated Hudson Valley and exurban stretches of New Jersey and Connecticut, which are as cursed as anyplace with poorly planned development and traffic, are also blessed with people who choose to live closer to the soil. Farmers raise alpacas, peacocks and funky heirloom chickens. Cotswold sheep graze in Bedford Hills. The green, open space that greets the tourist is not all sanctified parkland. Some of it works for a living.\n        This vision of life is not only pretty, but also smart. The Glynwood Center, a nonprofit organization in Cold Spring that helps communities preserve open space, views diversified agriculture as a homeland-security issue, making the reasonable argument that a richly varied food supply is less vulnerable to disruption and destruction than corporate monoculture.\n        Many things are still amiss in the suburban landscape. It has too many deer and resident geese, too many ticks. Farmland is disappearing, and those malls aren't going anywhere.\n        But something must be going right if coyotes are coming back. These smart, slinky creatures, once feared and slaughtered, are being studied and newly appreciated as predators restoring balance to an out-of-whack food chain.\n        They have one particular habit that justifies their presence in the suburbs a thousand times over.

As the dollar fell over the past two weeks, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. played his role, saying that ''a strong dollar is clearly in our nation's best interest.'' And Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave a speech in which he was cautiously optimistic about economic growth and signaled that he would not cut interest rates anytime soon.\n        Growth and relatively high rates -- if they came to pass -- would be a good combination for the dollar. But as of yesterday, the dollar hadn't moved up much from its recent lows against other major currencies. Investors remain largely focused on economic weakness in the United States and gathering strength in Europe -- which portend a weaker dollar, no matter what anyone says.\n        A weaker currency is inevitable for a country as indebted as the United States is. During the Bush years, deficits have mushroomed -- in the federal budget and in trade. Anything that affects foreign investors' willingness to finance enormous deficits pushes the dollar down -- including better investment opportunities elsewhere, as there are now.\n        The great unknowables are the timing and steepness of a sustained dollar decline.

But the current swoon is a reminder that no nation, even the United States, can borrow forever without facing up to economic consequences.\n        The government has been assuming -- correctly, so far -- that the United States is too big to fail. Administration officials seem confident that the Chinese, in particular, will continue to finance the nation's deficits, because doing so helps their exports. They also assume that China and other countries won't sell off chunks of their huge dollar holdings, lest they drive the dollar down, and with it, the value of their remaining dollar-based assets.\n        That's more like a standoff than stability, and it puts way too much of the nation's well being in the hands of foreign central bankers. But it's the best the Bush crowd has had to offer, because true stability in global finance is grounded in fiscal responsibility at home, something the administration lacks.\n        Global balance requires cooperation. When Mr. Paulson travels to China this month, he will no doubt seek ways to adjust American and Chinese currencies in an orderly fashion. But there is no substitute for getting one's own financial house in order.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1672977,"ids":1672977,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Television viewers relishing crime-show denouements based on airtight DNA evidence had best get a grip on reality: DNA is only as reliable as the humans testing it. Virginia's once highly touted crime lab has starkly demonstrated this in an error-ridden death-row case that was propped up repeatedly by botched DNA studies from the state's supposed experts.\n        Gov. Mark Warner has wisely ordered a review of more than 150 capital murder convictions involving DNA evidence. He acted in the face of an independent panel's finding that bad science and political intrusion underpinned the 17-year imprisonment of Earl Washington Jr., a mentally retarded man who came within days of execution for a vicious rape-murder.\n        After years of controversy and defensive denials by police and statehouse officials, independent DNA testing forced by outside critics from the Innocence Project not only cleared Mr. Washington, but also positively identified another suspect now in prison as the source of DNA evidence at the murder scene. As doubts and real evidence mounted, state officials reluctantly pardoned Mr. Washington in 2000, but they did so seven years later than they should have if the state lab had done a proper job with the latest technology. Even now, some officials ludicrously theorize that Mr. Washington could have killed the woman, despite the proof of someone else's DNA.\n        Behind a veneer of official expertise, the lab director refused an outside review, but Governor Warner ordered one. Specialists from the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors faulted the lab in a searing critique that should serve as a nationwide warning about the often shoddy and unprofessional standards that can afflict the criminal justice system via the crime labs of America.\n        For openers, the labs must be kept truly independent and subject to credible review by scientific peers. They should be insulated by law from the sort of political pressures found to have been exerted in the Washington case by officials intent on defending the capital punishment system as error-free. More than political careers, lives are at stake -- 23 of them right now on Virginia's busy death row.\n        As Virginia was once hailed as a role model by other state crime labs, so its dangerous flaws must serve as a recipe for badly needed improvements. And producers of television's crime lab heroics might want to consider the tortured Earl Washington case for a plot-line leap into reality.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1811345,"ids":1811345,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Tempted to buy cheap medicines from a pharmacy Web site? Think twice. If the Web site shows no verifiable street address for the pharmacy, there is a 50 percent chance the drugs are counterfeit.\n        In rich countries, fake medicines mainly come from virtual stores. Elsewhere, they are on the pharmacy shelves. In much of the former Soviet Union, 20 percent of the drugs on sale are fakes. In parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, 30 percent are counterfeit. The culprits range from mom-and-pop operations processing chalk in their garages to organized-crime networks that buy the complicity of regulators, customs officials and pharmacists.\n        In Panama, dozens of people died after taking counterfeit drugs made with an industrial solvent. Often counterfeiters put in real ingredients for their smell or taste, but heavily diluted. This has sped the emergence of resistant strains of infections, and is probably a big reason some malaria drugs and antibiotics have lost their power.\n        Drug counterfeiting can be fought. Five years ago, the majority of Nigeria's drugs were fakes, and the country was a major source of counterfeits abroad. When the Nigerian government donated 88,000 doses of meningitis vaccine to Niger during an epidemic in 1995, the vaccine turned out to be a fake -- causing more than 2,500 children to die.\n        Now the possibility that a drug is fake in Nigeria has dropped to 17 percent, according to the World Health Organization. The country's drug control agency is informing people through radio and TV jingles about fake medicines. It has also fired corrupt officials, hired a fleet of inspectors to drop in on pharmacies, banned imports from some 30 companies, and begun prosecuting counterfeiters.\n        One of the problems Nigeria still faces is that the penalty for counterfeiting medicine is as little as a $70 fine -- a small price to pay for a crime that can reap a fortune. All over the developing world, governments treat falsifying medicines as a mere copyright infringement, rather than potential murder.\n        The W.H.O. has recently set up a task force that brings together many groups that work on counterfeit drugs. It is a start. Multinational drug companies -- which have been reluctant to report fakes lest they erode consumer confidence in all drugs -- need to do more. An international convention is also needed to establish stiffer penalties for counterfeiting drugs, and marshal more funds and support to fight this deadly crime.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1687205,"ids":1687205,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Ten years ago, during the war in Bosnia, ethnic Serb forces murdered more than 7,000 men and boys in Srebrenica, almost every Muslim male in the city. That genocide stands as the worst atrocity against civilians in Europe since World War II, and as a tragic symbol of the inability of United Nations peacekeepers to protect civilian populations. A decade later, the two men with ultimate responsibility for the massacre remain free. And despite the parallel tragedy of Rwanda, the major powers that run the U.N. Security Council have yet to make peacekeeping operations more credible and effective.\n        The survivors of Srebrenica honored the anniversary of the massacre on Monday by burying 610 of their sons and brothers and fathers, the latest to have been identified through DNA tests of bones dug up from mass graves. So far, only 2,000 people have been identified and properly buried. As Muslim children dressed in white stood amid rows of coffins, Serb policemen stood by respectfully. The president of Serbia, Boris Tadic, attended the ceremony.\n        But shovels of dirt will not lay this infamy to rest. The men of Srebrenica were murdered after the world betrayed them in the bloody war that raged in Bosnia, a fragment of the former Yugoslavia. The ethnic Serbs who terrorized the Srebrenica region were bent on killing or driving away every Muslim Bosnian. United Nations commanders, knowing that a Serb assault on Srebrenica was imminent, rejected calls from local peacekeepers for airstrikes on Serb positions. The United Nations disarmed the people of the town and declared it a ''safe area.'' But the 370 Dutch peacekeepers assigned there had only light weapons and orders to use them only in self-defense. The United Nations allowed Serb soldiers to round up the men and boys, and to take them away and kill them.\n        That same year, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the top political and military leaders of Bosnia's Serbs during the war, were indicted on charges of genocide by the war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. But they remain free, hiding in different parts of the still-divided region. Even when NATO had 60,000 troops in Bosnia supposedly charged with arresting wanted men, the two Bosnian Serbs moved with relative impunity. NATO governments, principally Washington, did not want to risk their troops by trying to arrest either man.\n        Today, 7,000 European Union troops patrol Bosnia, apparently unable to find Mr. Karadzic, who is protected by his followers and is still a hero to many of his fellow Serbs. The European troops patrolling Bosnia must make Mr. Karadzic's capture their top priority, and international pressure to arrest Mr. Mladic must increase on neighboring Serbia, where he has taken refuge and finds great sympathy among members of the army.\n        In the Serb Republic carved out of Bosnia, Mr. Karadzic is still perhaps the most powerful figure in the ruling party. He runs a smuggling network that controls patronage for thousands. As long as Mr. Karadzic is in control, reconciliation among Serbs, Croats and Muslims in Bosnia is a far-off dream. Capturing Mr. Karadzic and Mr. Mladic is not just a way to keep faith with the dead -- it is the only way to move these regions into the modern world.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1695804,"ids":1695804,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Terrorism typically prompts democratic societies to sacrifice some liberty in the name of more security, and Britain, after the deadly July 7 subway and bus bombings in London, has been no exception.\n        The problems come when hastily considered security measures damage essential democratic rights or consign whole communities -- the law-abiding along with the dangerous -- to second-class citizenship. That kind of broad-brush profiling is not only unjust but also unwise, because it tends to dry up the cooperation from community leaders that is essential to isolating the terrorist fringe.\n        Britain's latest package of antiterrorism measures is still being refined. But the basic thrust of the new approach was announced by Prime Minister Tony Blair earlier this month. Some of the contemplated steps seem sensible and appropriate, like developing sterner rules to exclude foreign supporters of terrorism from entering Britain.\n        Others, however, are seriously troubling, like Mr. Blair's plan to criminalize not just direct incitement to terrorism in Britain but anything the government may categorize as ''condoning,'' ''glorifying'' or ''justifying'' terrorism anywhere in the world. Words like that are far too vague, elastic and subject to diplomatic selectivity. Similarly troubling is the government's plan to expand its list of deportable offenses to include the expression of ''what the government considers to be extreme views.'' And the idea of making naturalized, but not native-born, British citizens deportable for ''extremism'' is inherently divisive and should not be pursued.\n        Considering the costly damage the Bush administration has done to America's reputation and liberties through its abuse of similar authority, Mr. Blair should have known better than to open himself up to a repeat of the same mistakes. Of course, he expects the British people and Parliament, which will be called on to approve most of these changes, to trust his government to use such new powers carefully and wisely. But that is never a responsible basis for enacting laws that could be around longer than today's government officials.\n        Besides, pleas for trust are sounding rather hollow just now in light of this week's shocking disclosures about the circumstances under which the police shot an innocent man to death on a London subway train in July. It now appears that the most crucial elements of the explanation the authorities told the public about this incident are wrong. The man was not, it turns out, knowingly running from the police. He was not wearing a heavy padded jacket that might have hidden a bomb. And he did not jump the turnstile. Further, it now appears that the authorities knew the truth even as they continued giving out false and misleading information.\n        A full disclosure of what really happened and why, followed by full accountability for those responsible, would help clear the air for serious parliamentary consideration of new antiterrorism laws.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1831626,"ids":1831626,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Terrorists terrorize people. That's no surprise. What is shocking, and scandalous, is that American law currently bars the entry to the United States of some of terrorism's most abused victims: refugees who have been forced, often at gunpoint, to provide so-called material assistance.\n        Among those excluded by these provisions are a 13-year-old Ugandan girl taken away by the Lord's Resistance Army and forced to gather food and cook for her abductors, and a Sri Lankan fisherman kidnapped by Tamil Tiger rebels and forced to pay a ransom for his freedom. Some who fought as irregulars alongside American troops in Indochina also now find themselves excluded because they have been wrongly classed as terrorists. Watching all that, Iraqis may well ask why they should now risk their lives in support of American policies if this is what they can expect if they ever have to seek refuge in the United States.\n        Just about everyone, including Bush administration officials, agrees that these rules need to be fixed. But the remedy that the Homeland Security Department has recently proposed -- chiefly a promise of discretionary waivers -- does not go nearly far enough. Unless the administration comes up with an acceptable solution soon, Congress will have to.\n        The problem begins with a sloppy definition of terrorism written into a 1990 immigration law. It was compounded after the 9\/11 terrorist attacks by the Bush administration's overly aggressive and rigid interpretation of what constitutes material support for terrorism. Standard legal definitions of terrorism characterize it as planning or committing unlawful, violent acts aimed at killing, injuring or intimidating innocent civilians. But the 1990 law defined it in a way that could encompass virtually any illegal civilian use of weapons -- even to resist a violent dictatorship or to fight alongside American troops.\n        The Bush administration, using the Patriot Act and other tools, turned this into a much bigger problem by pumping up the number of groups -- and individuals -- officially labeled as terrorist and aggressively enforcing the concept of material support.\n        In response to complaints from both parties in Congress and from religious and human rights groups, the administration recently agreed to consider selective waivers of the material support ban. But the waivers would apply only if the groups doing the intimidating were not on any of the State Department's lists of terrorist organizations. That is a cruel and irrelevant distinction. Duress is duress, no matter which group coerced the cooperation.\n        Unless the administration is prepared to make waivers available to all who deserve them, Congress needs to rewrite the underlying legislation so that no one who was coerced into providing material support to any group will be automatically excluded. Congress also needs to tighten the 1990 immigration law's overly broad interpretation of terrorism, bringing it into line with definitions in other statutes.\n        And as with so many other excesses of the Bush administration, officials need to stop, think and exercise sense rather than zealotry when they define who is a terrorist and what constitutes providing support to terrorism. In the name of keeping out terrorists, Washington should not slam the door on terrorism's victims.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":4,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1823783,"ids":1823783,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The $21 billion program to expand and upgrade New York's public transit system is over budget, perhaps by some $1.4 billion. News of that kind feels like one shoe dropping, in this case leaving open the possibility of a fare hike, service cuts, or both.\n        Gov. Eliot Spitzer's newly appointed chair for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Elliot Sander, hasn't ruled out an increase, which would be the first since 2005; indeed, one seems inevitable down the line. But his first priority is to make sure that basic needs like maintenance are taken care of.\n        A host of projects are competing for sparse capital funds. The largest and most expensive, including the Second Avenue subway, have been long awaited. But if money cannot be found through savings or additional state aid, they must take a back seat to basic maintenance and life support for an aging system.\n        An audit report issued last week by the City Comptroller, Bill Thompson, echoed and quantified concerns of rider advocates, led by the nonpartisan Straphangers Campaign. The underlying problem, as always, is that state lawmakers send disproportionate amounts of M.T.A. money to upstate and suburban systems. For instance, the city receives only 75 percent of maintenance money even though it accounts for 84 percent of the statewide ridership.\n        This, in turn, means maintenance deferred. Dirtier stations and cars are the least of the problem; the safety and security of the subway passengers are also at risk. Mr. Thompson found that more than one-third of 201 smoke-clearing fan plants for subway tunnels -- needed in case of fire or other emergencies -- are overdue for upgrades.\n        Transit officials express hope they can narrow or even close the gap in the current capital plan, which runs through 2009. But even if they could, the authority's fiscal pickle is bigger than just the capital program.\n        Underfunded for years by the administration of Gov. George Pataki, the M.T.A. became dependent on borrowing to make up the difference, and it has had to divert hundreds of millions of dollars annually just to service the debt interest. Ever-increasing operating budget shortfalls are projected, approaching $2 billion in 2010. Mr. Spitzer's first budget seems to do little to change the trend.\n        All this occurs as the city relies more and more on public transit. Some 7.5 million people ride daily, more than ever before. And as the population continues to grow -- to a projected 9 million in the next 20 years -- the battle against wear and tear can be expected to further overwhelm resources. The city's subways are in much better shape than they were in the 1980s, when filth, delays and crime were commuters' constant companions. To remain that way, and to meet future needs, the system needs intensive care, and a realistic contribution from Albany.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1674947,"ids":1674947,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Air Force is pressing hard to develop defensive and offensive space weapons without adequately considering the potential adverse consequences. At this point, it is not clear whether Air Force aspirations for these weapons are mostly technological fantasy or have some real hope of success. It is certainly true that the Air Force wants to achieve and maintain military superiority in space. ''We haven't reached the point of strafing and bombing from space,'' an Air Force official said last year. ''Nonetheless, we are thinking about those possibilities.''\n        Already, the Air Force has spent billions of dollars on its effort to develop space weapons, with little public discussion. Now, as an article by Tim Weiner of The Times revealed last Wednesday, the Air Force is seeking a presidential directive that could strengthen military uses of space.\n        Currently, space satellites serve important military roles but only in support of ground operations. American forces rely heavily on satellites for communications, global navigation, location and tracking of targets, and collection of intelligence. If an enemy managed to disrupt these in a time of conflict, American forces would lose one of their great advantages, so it is reasonable for the military to seek ways to protect its satellites from harm or else lessen reliance on them and compensate for their loss.\n        What the Air Force has in mind is shrouded in secrecy and euphemisms, but some sense can be gleaned from an array of programs described by Mr. Weiner. An experimental microsatellite launched last month has the technical ability to disrupt other nations' military satellites. A proposed global strike space plane would carry munitions halfway around the world in 45 minutes. The ''Rods From God'' program would hurl dense metal rods at targets on the ground with the force of a small nuclear weapon. Other programs would use laser beams or radio waves to disable targets.\n        This all sounds similar to the technological hubris shown by missile defense planners, who started out with grandiose Star Wars designs two decades ago. Now, $100 billion later, they still can't reliably detect and destroy an incoming missile. Nobody knows how well the new weapons might work, and there is concern, even in military circles, that basing weapons in space might trigger an arms race that would leave the United States, with its undeniable advantage in conventional forces, worse off than it is now. Another problem is cost. With virtually all weapons systems busting their budgets, the Pentagon should think hard before putting hundreds of billions of dollars into new space technologies.\n        Congress and the administration need to assess whether a multilateral treaty to ban space weapons might not leave the nation far safer than a unilateral drive to put the first weapons in space.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":18,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1688606,"ids":1688606,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The American people know little about Judge John Roberts, other than that President Bush is nominating him to fill Sandra Day O'Connor's seat on the Supreme Court.

If he is a mainstream conservative in the tradition of Justice O'Connor, he should be confirmed. But if on closer inspection he turns out to be an extreme ideologue with an agenda of stripping away important rights, he should not be.\n        Judge Roberts is a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and before that he was a lawyer in the administrations of President Ronald Reagan and the first President George Bush. Compared with many of the possible nominees whose names have been circulating, he has a thin record on controversial subjects. This may have helped him win the nomination because it gives the other side so little to work with. But it also puts a greater burden on the Senate to determine what kind of justice he would be.\n        One of the most important areas for the Senate to explore is Judge Roberts's views on federalism -- the issue of how much power the federal government should have. The far right is on a drive to resurrect ancient, and discredited, states' rights theories. If extremists take control of the Supreme Court, we will end up with an America in which the federal government is powerless to protect against air pollution, unsafe working conditions and child labor. There are reasons to be concerned about Judge Roberts on this score. He dissented in an Endangered Species Act case in a way that suggested he might hold an array of environmental laws, and other important federal protections, to be unconstitutional.\n        There are also serious questions about the attitude of Judge Roberts toward abortion rights. As a lawyer in the first President Bush's administration, he helped write a brief arguing that Roe v. Wade should be overturned.\n        President Bush did the country a service by making his nomination early enough for the Senate to have ample time to investigate the judge's record and hold hearings. The leaders in both parties should resist any pressures to move quickly. It would be irresponsible to take a position on the nomination of Judge Roberts until his background is carefully reviewed, and until senators have a chance to question him at length.

These devices, a low-tech response to America's overwhelming military power, are now causing 70 percent to 80 percent of the American combat deaths in Iraq.\n        More than two years ago, according to newly disclosed documents, Marine commanders in Al Anbar Province, a center of the Sunni insurgency, submitted an urgent request for more than 1,100 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles, or MRAPs, that have V-shaped bottoms able to deflect blasts from below. For reasons yet to be satisfactorily explained, military officials initially sat on the request and then ordered relatively few.\n        Some, second-guessing the judgment of the battlefield commanders, apparently felt that Humvees with upgraded armor could do the job. Others may have been reluctant to invest billions of dollars in vehicles that might have little use after Iraq.

But Iraq is the war that Americans are fighting and dying in today.\n        Only now are Pentagon leaders, prodded by Senator Joseph R.

Congress has accelerated funding to buy more than 7,000 of the vehicles by early next year, and the military services are seeking some 21,000 in all, at a cost that could exceed $20 billion. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has declared his determination to ''produce as many of these vehicles and get them into the field as fast as possible,'' though the precise number needed has yet to be established.\n        Unfortunately, the MRAPs will remain vulnerable to the deadliest I.E.D.'s, known as ''explosively formed penetrators,'' which destroy vehicles from the side. The military is looking for ways to add armor to the MRAPs and is testing another new vehicle to counter that threat.\n        If the small companies that make these vehicles are not able to produce the quantities needed quickly, President Bush and Secretary Gates ought to make this a crash program and enlist major manufacturers.\n        There can be no excuse for failing to provide the best possible protection for American troops in this disastrous war.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1654089,"ids":1654089,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Bush administration enthusiastically congratulated itself this week for including abuses by Iraqi authorities in its annual report on human rights violations. One State Department official called it proof that ''we don't look the other way.'' But the report did look away -- from American involvement in the mistreatment it decried. In the end it was another sad reminder of the heavy price the nation has paid for ignoring fundamental human rights in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guant\u00e1namo; in the secret cells where the C.I.A. holds its unaccounted-for prisoners; and at home, where President Bush continues to claim the power to hold Americans in jail indefinitely without the right to trial.\n        The administration's refusal to remedy these abuses -- or even acknowledge most of them -- leaves the 2004 human rights report heavy with irony and saps its authority. Not only did the report fail to mention that the Iraqi government it criticized was appointed and controlled by the United States, but it also chastised the local security forces for the same kinds of arbitrary detentions, abusive treatment and torture that have been widespread in American military and intelligence prison camps. Indeed, some of the practices the report labeled as torture when employed by foreign governments were approved at one point for American detention centers by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.\n        The horrible abuses at Abu Ghraib and other American prison camps badly damaged the nation's image as a defender of human rights. The administration then worsened the damage by refusing to deal with the issue openly and forcefully. Just yesterday, Douglas Jehl of The Times reported that the Senate Intelligence Committee's Republican chairman, Pat Roberts of Kansas, is blocking a serious inquiry into the C.I.A.'s abuse of prisoners.\n        Meanwhile, on the same day the State Department issued its human rights report, the administration said it would fight a third federal court order to end the illegal detention of Jose Padilla, an American citizen who has been held for nearly three years without charges because Mr. Bush has declared him an ''enemy combatant.''\n        A district court judge in South Carolina, Henry Floyd, who was appointed by Mr. Bush in 2003, said the president's claim that he could order such detentions was ''deeply troubling.'' He said endorsing that view ''would totally eviscerate the limits placed on presidential authority to protect the citizenry's individual liberties.'' His ruling echoed earlier decisions by federal courts in New York, which were mooted when the Supreme Court said Mr. Padilla's case should have been heard in South Carolina, where he is held in a Navy brig. Now that has happened, and still Attorney General Alberto Gonzales says the administration will not accept the decision.\n        Mr. Gonzales continues to cling to the fiction that combating terrorism somehow gives Mr. Bush the power to violate Americans' constitutional rights. The administration's appeal will needlessly further delay Mr. Padilla's day in court. But we hope it will finally lead to a Supreme Court ruling against the White House's abuse of power.

In a new ''national space policy'' posted without fanfare on an obscure government Web site, and in recent speeches, it has signaled its determination to be pre-eminent in space -- as it is in air power and sea power -- while opposing any treaties that might curtail any American action there.\n        This chest-thumping is being portrayed as a modest extension of the Clinton administration's space policy issued a decade ago. And so far there is no mention of putting American weapons in space. But the more aggressive tone of the Bush policy may undercut international cooperation on civilian space projects -- a goal to which the new policy subscribes -- or set off an eventual arms race in space.\n        The new policy reflects the worst tendencies of the Bush administration -- a unilateral drive for supremacy and a rejection of treaties. And it comes just as the White House is desperately seeking help to rein in the nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran. That effort depends heavily on cooperation from China and Russia, two countries with their own active space programs.\n        The administration regards the policy as a necessary update to reflect how important space is becoming for the American economy and defense. But outside experts who have parsed the language are struck by how forceful and nationalistic it sounds.\n        Whereas the 1996 policy opened with assurances that the United States would pursue greater levels of partnership and cooperation in space, the new policy states: ''In this new century, those who effectively utilize space will enjoy added prosperity and security and will hold a substantial advantage over those who do not. Freedom of action in space is as important to the United States as air power and sea power.''\n        The only solace is that the new policy does not endorse placing weapons in space or fighting in, through or from space, as the Air Force has been urging. But neither does it rule out these activities.\n        In keeping with the more muscular stance, the administration is also opposing any negotiations on a treaty to prevent an arms race in outer space -- arguing that it may impede America's ability to defend its satellites from ground-based weapons. That seems shortsighted. An international treaty to keep space free of weapons might well provide greater security than a unilateral declaration that we will do whatever we have to do to preserve our own space assets.\n        Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, insisted he did not intend to sound jingoistic when he addressed a conference in Spain this month -- but he sure came across that way. He wondered aloud what language future settlers of the Moon and Mars would speak. ''Will my language be passed down over the generations to future lunar colonies?'' he asked. ''Or will another, bolder or more persistent culture surpass our efforts and put their own stamp on the predominant lunar society of the far future?''\n        We fear the old notion that space might provide the perfect arena for international cooperation may be yielding to a new era of competition -- one not seen since the cold war race to the moon.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1819083,"ids":1819083,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Bush administration has appointed an extreme political partisan as the new United States attorney for Arkansas. Normally, the Senate would have vetted him, and quite possibly blocked his appointment. But the White House took advantage of a little-noticed provision of the Patriot Act, which allows it to do an end run around the Senate.\n        It is particularly dangerous to put United States attorneys' offices in the hands of political operatives because federal prosecutors have extraordinary power to issue subpoenas and bring criminal charges. The Senate should fix the law and investigate whether such offices in Arkansas and elsewhere are being politicized.\n        Bud Cummins, the respected United States attorney in Little Rock, recently left office.

One way to ensure that is to require them to submit to questions from the Senate, and face a confirmation vote.\n        Senators Feinstein, Leahy and Pryor have a bill to change the method for selecting interim United States attorneys back to what it once was: the federal district court in the jurisdiction would make the appointment.

So it is odd to hear it claim that it lacks the power to slow global warming by limiting the emission of harmful gases. But that is just what it will argue to the Supreme Court tomorrow, in what may be the most important environmental case in many years.\n        A group of 12 states, including New York and Massachusetts, is suing the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to properly do its job. These states, backed by environmental groups and scientists, say that the Clean Air Act requires the E.P.A. to impose limits on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted by new cars. These gases are a major contributor to the ''greenhouse effect'' that is dangerously heating up the planet.\n        The Bush administration insists that the E.P.A. does not have the power to limit these gases. It argues that they are not ''air pollutants'' under the Clean Air Act. Alternatively, it contends that the court should dismiss the case because the states do not have ''standing,'' since they cannot show that they will be specifically harmed by the agency's failure to regulate greenhouse gases.\n        A plain reading of the Clean Air Act shows that the states are right. The act says that the E.P.A. ''shall'' set standards for ''any air pollutant'' that in its judgment causes or contributes to air pollution that ''may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.'' The word ''welfare,'' the law says, includes ''climate'' and ''weather.'' The E.P.A. makes an array of specious arguments about why the act does not mean what it expressly says. But it has no right to refuse to do what Congress said it ''shall'' do.\n        Beneath the statutory and standing questions, this is a case about how seriously the government takes global warming. The E.P.A.'s decision was based in part on its poorly reasoned conclusion that there was too much ''scientific uncertainty'' about global warming to worry about it. The government's claim that the states lack standing also scoffs at global warming, by failing to acknowledge that the states have a strong interest in protecting their land and citizens against coastal flooding and the other kinds of damage that are being projected.\n        In a friend-of-the-court brief, climate scientists from the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Stanford University and other respected institutions warn that ''the scientific evidence of the risks, long time lags and irreversibility of climate change argue persuasively for prompt regulatory action.'' The Supreme Court can strike an important blow in defense of the planet simply by ruling that the E.P.A. must start following the law.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1657416,"ids":1657416,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Bush administration has come under a lot of criticism for its attempts to fob off government propaganda as genuine news reports. Whether federal agencies are purchasing the services of supposedly independent columnists or making videos extolling White House initiatives and then disguising them as TV news reports, that's wrong. But it is time to acknowledge that the nation's news organizations have played a large and unappetizing role in deceiving the public.\n        As documented this week in an article in The Times by David Barstow and Robin Stein, more than 20 federal agencies, including the State Department and the Defense Department, now create fake news clips. The Bush administration spent $254 million in its first four years on contracts with public relations firms, more than double the amount spent by the Clinton administration.\n        Most of these tapes are very skillfully done, including ''interviews'' that seem genuine and ''reporters'' who look much like the real thing. Only sophisticated viewers would easily recognize that these videos are actually unpaid commercial announcements for the White House or some other part of the government. Some of the videos clearly cross the line into the proscribed territory of propaganda, and the Government Accountability Office says at least two were illegally distributed.\n        But too many television stations run government videos anyway, without any hint of where they came from. And while some claim they somehow stumbled accidentally into this trap, it seems obvious that in most cases, television stations that are short on reporters, long on air time to fill and unwilling to spend the money needed for real news gathering are abdicating their editorial responsibilities to the government's publicity teams. Bush administration officials now insist that they carefully label any domestic releases as government handouts.\n        However disingenuous those assurances may be, in at least some cases the stations are the main culprits in the deception -- as at the Fox affiliate in Memphis, where a station reporter narrated a State Department video, using the text that came with it. The Times also reported on a small central Illinois station that was so eager to snap up this low-cost filler that it asked the Agriculture Department to have its ''reporter'' refer to its morning show in his closing lines. The Times tracked station malpractice into bigger markets, like San Diego (the ABC affiliate) and Louisville, Ky. (the Fox affiliate).\n        If using pretend news is one of the ways these stations have chosen to save money, it's a false economy. If it represents a political decision to support President Bush, it will eventually backfire. This kind of practice cheapens the real commodity that television stations have to sell during their news hours: their credibility.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1819082,"ids":1819082,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Bush administration is eager to start work on a new nuclear warhead with all sorts of admirable qualities: sturdy, reliable and secure from terrorists. To sweeten the deal, officials say that if they can replace the current arsenal with Reliable Replacement Warheads (what could sound more comforting?), they probably won't have to keep so many extra warheads to hedge against technical failure. If you're still not sold, the warhead comes with something of a guarantee -- that scientists can build the new bombs without ever testing them.\n        Let the buyer beware. While the program has gotten very little attention here, it is a public-relations disaster in the making overseas. Suspicions that the United States is actually trying to build up its nuclear capabilities are undercutting Washington's arguments for restraining the nuclear appetites of Iran and North Korea.\n        Then there's the tens of billions it is likely to cost. And the most important question: Nearly two decades after the country stopped building nuclear weapons, does it really need a new one? The answer, emphatically, is no. This is a make-work program championed by the weapons laboratories and belatedly by the Pentagon, which hasn't been able to get Congress to pay for its other nuclear fantasies.\n        The Rumsfeld team's first choice was for a nuclear ''bunker buster'' to go after deeply buried targets. The Pentagon got concerned about ''aging'' warheads only after it was clear that even the Republican-led Congress, or at least one intrepid House subcommittee chairman, considered the bunker buster too Strangelovian to finance.\n        One crucial argument for the new program took a major hit in November when the Jason -- a prestigious panel of scientists that advises the government on weapons -- reported that most of the plutonium triggers in the current arsenal can be expected to last for 100 years. Since the oldest weapons are less than 50 years old, supporters of the new warhead have fallen back on warnings that other bomb components are also aging, and that the nuclear labs need the work to attract and train the best scientists. But the labs are already spending billions on studying and preserving the current arsenal.\n        Then there's that guarantee that there will be no need for testing -- one of the few arms-control taboos President Bush hasn't broken yet. While experts debate whether the labs can really build a weapon without testing it, the more important question is whether any president would stake America's security on an untested arsenal.\n        America would be much safer if the president focused on reducing the number of old nuclear weapons still deployed by the United States and the other nuclear powers. The new Congress should stop this program before any more dollars are wasted, or more damage is done to America's credibility.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1689126,"ids":1689126,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The Bush administration is full of tough talk about opposing the spread of nuclear weapons. But it keeps undermining the world's most effective instrument for doing so: the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In May, top administration officials stood aside as a crucial review conference meant to strengthen the treaty ended in a stalemate. Now Washington wants to allow India an end run around the treaty's basic bargain -- the one that rewards the countries that are willing to renounce nuclear weapons with the opportunity to import highly sensitive nuclear technology for power reactors.\n        The strength of that bargain has dissuaded many countries that are capable of building or buying nuclear arms from doing so, including Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Japan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The bargain's credibility has depended on the willingness of the major nuclear exporters to uphold it. One of the most powerful examples of the price a nation would pay for ignoring the rules has been the nuclear export restrictions the United States has imposed on India for decades, ever since India declined to sign the treaty and tested a nuclear device, using materials and technology diverted from a civilian nuclear power program.\n        Lifting these restrictions would encourage other countries to follow New Delhi's dangerous example. It is now up to Congress and the other nuclear supplier nations to take back what President Bush has so carelessly given away.\n        India is a great nation with a great future and many common interests with the United States. But India is also one of only four countries in the world that does not abide by the nonproliferation treaty. Pakistan and Israel have also refused to sign it, and North Korea dropped out. None of these other holdouts are now eligible to buy the kind of sensitive nuclear technology being proposed for India.\n        Besides the four holdouts and the five established nuclear powers recognized under the treaty -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- no other nations are known to have nuclear weapons. Without the treaty, there might now be as many as 20 or 25 nuclear weapons states.\n        The Bush administration is, of course, eager to stop governments it does not like from acquiring nuclear weapons. It regularly rattles military and diplomatic sabers at North Korea and Iran. But it seems to have almost as much contempt for international treaties as it has for rogue states. Given the increasing accessibility of nuclear weapons technology and the growing number of potential governmental and nongovernmental suppliers of the needed materials and equipment, only a strengthened nonproliferation treaty, enforced without exceptions, stands any chance of slowing the spread of nuclear arsenals.

When Senator Richard Durbin compared the Guant\u00e1namo military prison to the Gulag, the White House beat the drums of outrage for days and furiously demanded an apology, which Mr. Durbin delivered.\n        But even two days later, President Bush and other senior officials had expressed no real criticism of Pat Robertson's call for the assassination of the president of Venezuela. Mr. Robertson said that on his Christian television network on Monday -- explaining that such action would be cheaper than a war -- but finally admitted yesterday that he had been wrong. Imagine, for comparison purposes, what the White House would say if a Syrian mullah had gone on Al Jazeera and called for the assassination of the president of the United States.\n        Yet all we've heard has been a tepid State Department comment that Mr. Robertson's remark was inappropriate and that it is not American policy to kill Venezuela's president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. We're certainly glad to know that. The government has been forbidden to conduct political assassinations overseas for about 30 years.\n        Certainly, there is tension between the Bush administration and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who blames Mr. Bush for the coup that threw him out of office briefly in 2002. Since then, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez has gotten tight with Fidel Castro and declared his undying enmity for the Bush team. Those things don't make him unique in the troubled history of Washington's relations with Latin America. And they're certainly no excuse for any responsible person to call for his murder -- especially one who styles himself as a man of god.\n        Mr. Robertson -- who once made headlines when he said liberal judges were a bigger threat to America than the 9\/11 terrorists -- is a member of the church-based right wing, which was indispensable in Mr. Bush's re-election and will be needed by the Republicans in 2006. That obviously makes things awkward for the president. But common decency, not to mention a rational sense of the national interest, demands condemnation of his remarks.\n        Mr. Robertson was defiant as he began the day yesterday, headlining his show with Pat's Age-Defying Protein Pancakes, and claiming that he had been misinterpreted. But there isn't another way to interpret his comment on Monday about Mr. Chavez: ''I don't know about this doctrine of assassination, but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it.'' Finally, CNN reported in late afternoon that Mr. Robertson had apologized in a written statement.\n        When Mr. Robertson ran for president in 1988, he got angry when the press called him a televangelist.

It persuaded Congress to adopt its misnamed ''Healthy Forests'' initiative that helps timber companies as much as it helps communities at risk from forest fire. It threatens to overturn President Bill Clinton's popular roadless rule protecting the most remote areas of the forests, and it has already removed those protections from the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. Then last week, just before Christmas -- the administration's preferred time for unveiling bad news -- it announced a radical overhaul of the rules governing the management of the nation's 155 national forests.\n        The ostensible purpose of the change is to streamline a cumbersome management process and give individual forest managers more flexibility to respond to threats like wildfires and the increasing use of the forests by off-road vehicles. But the new rules would also eliminate vital environmental reviews, as mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, jettison wildlife protections that date to President Ronald Reagan, restrict public input, and replace detailed regulations, like those limiting clearcuts and protecting streams, with vague ''results-based'' goals. These are unacceptably high costs to pay for regulatory efficiency.\n        More broadly, the whole idea of giving local managers more flexibility defies history, however reasonable it appears on the surface. The main reason Congress enacted the National Forest Management Act in 1976 was that the public had lost confidence in the Forest Service, not only local foresters but also their bosses in Washington, who seemed mainly interested in harvesting timber no matter what the cost to the forest's ecological health.\n        There are, of course, forest mangers who act responsibly. And the administration promises that forest plans will be regularly audited under an ''environmental management system'' it has borrowed from private industry. But it is not clear who will be conducting these audits (indeed, it's entirely possible the timber industry could end up monitoring itself). Nor, given the vagueness of the new guidelines, are there any longer clear standards against which foresters and their plans can be measured.\n        This is a recipe for trouble. Forest supervisors have always been subject to fierce pressures from timber companies and the communities that depend upon them for jobs. Unless the law unambiguously requires them to protect nature -- giving them legal cover to resist industry pressures -- we could see a return to the days when what counted on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was not whether a manager harmonized the competing needs of nature and commerce but whether he met his annual ''cut.''\n        Representative Tom Udall and others in Congress may try to overturn these rules legislatively. Their chances in this Congress are slim to none. It's also true that in a purely statistical sense, the stakes for both sides are not as high as they were 15 years ago, when about 30 percent of domestic timber production came from the national forests. Today that figure is about 5 percent, partly because of shifting industry priorities and partly because of court rulings protecting endangered species like the spotted owl and their forest habitat. Still, there's plenty of room for mischief, especially if President Bush succeeds in rescinding the roadless rule. People like Mr. Udall are right to keep fighting.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1811987,"ids":1811987,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Bush administration is trampling on the First Amendment and well-established criminal law by trying to use a subpoena to force the American Civil Liberties Union to hand over a classified document in its possession. The dispute is shrouded in secrecy, and very little has been made public about the document, but we do not need to know what's in it to know what's at stake: if the government prevails, it will have engaged in prior restraint -- almost always a serious infringement on free speech -- and it could start using subpoenas to block reporting on matters of vital public concern.\n        Justice Department lawyers have issued a grand jury subpoena to the A.C.L.U. demanding that it hand over ''any and all copies'' of the three-and-a-half-page government document, which was recently leaked to the group. The A.C.L.U. is asking a Federal District Court judge in Manhattan to quash the subpoena.\n        There are at least two serious problems with the government's action. It goes far beyond what the law recognizes as the legitimate purpose of a subpoena. Subpoenas are supposed to assist an investigation, but the government does not need access to the A.C.L.U.'s document for an investigation since it already has its own copy. It is instead trying to confiscate every available copy of the document to keep its contents secret. The A.C.L.U. says it knows of no other case in which a grand jury subpoena has been used this way.\n        The subpoena is also a prior restraint because the government is trying to stop the A.C.L.U. in advance from speaking about the document's contents. The Supreme Court has held that prior restraints are almost always unconstitutional. The danger is too great that the government will overreach and use them to ban protected speech or interfere with free expression by forcing the media, and other speakers, to wait for their words to be cleared in advance. The correct way to deal with speech is to evaluate its legality after it has occurred.\n        The Supreme Court affirmed these vital principles in the Pentagon Papers case, when it rejected the Nixon administration's attempts to stop The Times and The Washington Post from publishing government documents that reflected badly on its prosecution of the Vietnam War. If the Nixon administration had been able to use the technique that the Bush administration is trying now, it could have blocked publication simply by ordering the newspapers to hand over every copy they had of the papers.\n        If the A.C.L.U.'s description of its secret document is correct, there is no legitimate national defense issue. The document does not contain anything like intelligence sources or troop movements, the group says. It is merely a general statement of policy whose release ''might perhaps be mildly embarrassing to the government.'' Given this administration's abysmal record on these issues, this case could set a disturbing and dangerous precedent. If the subpoena is enforced, the administration will have gained a powerful new tool for rolling back free-speech rights -- one that could be used to deprive Americans of information they need to make informed judgments about their elected leaders' policies and actions.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1678834,"ids":1678834,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The Bush administration likes to talk about how well it is protecting the nation from terrorism, but there is reason to be skeptical. Legislation on security for chemical plants has been blocked by special interests, and there have been unsettling reports recently about vulnerabilities in key areas like air travel and ports. This week, members of the 9\/11 commission held the first of a series of hearings to explore the progress that has been made since Sept. 11 in making the nation safe. The commission's new project is a worthy one. There is a real need for outside review of the administration's efforts.\n        The bipartisan 9\/11 commission has been the most effective, and most trusted, voice on national security since Sept. 11, 2001. When it issued its 567-page report last July, the commission promised to check a year later on how much progress had been made. This week the disbanded commission -- operating as a privately financed group, the 9\/11 Public Discourse Project -- began that process. It held a hearing on ''C.I.A. and F.B.I. Reform,'' the first of a series that will also include discussions on ''Securing the Homeland'' and ''Terrorism and W.M.D.'' At the end, the 9\/11 panel intends to issue a report card on how President Bush and Congress are doing.\n        It is clear that the president and the administration will not get top marks. At this week's hearings, experts faulted the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. for not having an adequate system for sharing information, something the commission strongly recommended. Future hearings will no doubt identify other serious problems.\n        Nearly four years after Sept. 11, Congress has still not passed legislation requiring upgraded security at chemical plants, which may be the nation's greatest vulnerability. In recent weeks, serious questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the port security program, which is intended to stop weapons of mass destruction before they can be shipped into the country. And it was hardly reassuring to learn that the F.B.I. waited two years before scrapping its enormous computerized case-management system despite mounting evidence that it would never work.\n        Because the commissioners have been such a credible voice on national security, they may be able to shame Congress and the president into putting safety ahead of special interests in some vital areas. Their report called for homeland security dollars to be allocated based on risks and vulnerabilities, but Congress has turned the funds into a pork barrel, shortchanging the most vulnerable areas. The commissioners should also press Congress to pass without further delay tough laws on safeguarding chemical plants and the transport of dangerous chemicals.\n        The 9\/11 commission's report called on Congress to improve its oversight of homeland security, and there is still much work to be done. Responsibility for the nation's safety is divided among too many committees and subcommittees. Congress should be holding more hearings and demanding more accountability from the administration.\n        After Sept. 11, the nation vowed never to be complacent again, but there is a danger that it is becoming just that. The 9\/11 commission will be doing a real service if it pushes the president and Congress to keep their promise to make Americans as safe as possible against a future attack.\n        Editorial: An Insecure Nation","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1796962,"ids":1796962,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Bush administration loves to talk about the virtues of ''sound science,'' by which it usually means science that buttresses its own political agenda. But when some truly independent science comes along to threaten that agenda, the administration often ignores or minimizes it. The latest example involves the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to reject the recommendations of experts inside and outside the government who had urged a significant tightening of federal standards regulating the amount of soot in the air.\n        At issue were so-called fine particles, tiny specks of soot that are less than one-thirtieth the diameter of a human hair. They penetrate deep into the lungs and circulatory system and have been implicated in tens of thousands of deaths annually from both respiratory and coronary disease. The E.P.A., obliged under the Clean Air Act to set new exposure levels every five years, tightened the daily standard. But it left unchanged the annual standard, which affects chronic exposure and which the medical community regards as more important.\n        In so doing, the agency rejected the recommendation of its own staff scientists and even that of its Clean Air Scientific Advisory Council, a 22-member group of outside experts that had recommended a significant tightening of the standards. Stephen Johnson, the agency administrator, claimed there was ''insufficient evidence'' linking health problems to long-term exposure. He added that ''wherever the science gave us a clear picture, we took clear action,'' noting also that ''there was not complete agreement on the standard.''\n        One wonders how much evidence Mr. Johnson requires, and how ''complete'' an ''agreement'' must be before he takes action. A 20-2 vote in favor of stronger standards seems fairly convincing to us; likewise the unanimous plea for stronger standards from mainstream groups like the American Medical Association.\n        The environmental and medical communities suspect that the administration's main motive was to save the power companies and other industrial sources of pollution about $1.9 billion in new investment that the more protective annual standard would have required. But here, too, the administration appears to have ignored expert advice. Last Friday, the agency released an economic analysis showing that in exchange for $1.9 billion in new costs, the stronger annual standards could save as many as 24,000 thousand lives and as much as $50 billion annually in health care and other costs to society. Studies like these always offer a range of possible outcomes, but even at the lower end -- 2,200 lives and $4.3 billion in money saved -- the cost-benefit ratios are very favorable.\n        In the next year or so, the administration must decide whether to tighten the standards for another pollutant, ground-level ozone, which causes smog and is also associated with respiratory diseases. The scientific advisory committee has tentatively recommended that the ozone standard be tightened, citing new evidence of smog's adverse effects. This time Mr. Johnson should pay more attention to the scientists and less to the political strategists in the White House.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1766213,"ids":1766213,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Bush administration signed off on a weak rule governing mercury emissions from power plants this week, only days after Gov. George Pataki of New York proposed a strong rule. This should come as no surprise. Over the last few years, the states have done a better job of cleaning the air and protecting public health than the federal government has, in part because they have been more aggressive in using regulatory leverage to force industry to develop cleaner ways of doing business.\n        The mercury issue is a case in point. Mercury is a toxin that has been found in increasingly high concentrations in fish in lakes and streams. The country's 1,100 coal-fired power plants produce 48 tons of it a year, a little over 40 percent of the total produced in the United States. The Bush rule, drafted in part by the electric utilities it seeks to regulate, aims at a 30 percent reduction in emissions by 2010 and a 70 percent reduction by 2018.\n        The rule relies on a market-based trading system that would let utilities reduce emissions or buy credits from other companies, allowing them to defer investments in their own plants. Emissions trading has worked well with other airborne pollutants, but in this case it is inappropriate because mercury, which tends to settle quickly, presents a special danger to residents near the source. The Clean Air Act plainly requires state-of-the-art controls at each plant for toxic substances like mercury, which means that the Bush rule may also be illegal. It is already the subject of a lawsuit.\n        Mr. Pataki's plan, by contrast, would require in-state plants to install the latest pollution-control technology with a goal of cutting mercury emissions by 50 percent by 2010 and by 90 percent by 2015. The big power companies managed to convince the Bush administration that targets like these would be ruinously expensive, but Mr. Pataki estimates that at worst they will add less than a dollar a month to the average residential electricity bill.\n        If successful on this score, Mr. Pataki will end his term with a solid record of achievement on clean air issues that should shame his Republican friends in Washington. He has imposed new limits on emissions of nitrogen oxide, which helps create smog, and sulfur dioxide, a contributor to acid rain. He has joined six other Northeastern states in a regional effort to reduce greenhouse gases, and he has joined California's effort to force a big reduction in those same gases from automobiles.\n        What distinguishes Mr. Pataki and other like-minded governors from the Bush administration -- nearly a dozen other states have imposed or are considering tougher mercury controls -- is their willingness to challenge industry to challenge itself. Mr. Bush has been talking a good game recently about how technology is going to help us on global warming and on producing alternative fuels, but history shows that industry usually needs powerful incentives to make things happen.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1788851,"ids":1788851,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Bush administration wants to change federal rules in a way that could cut $40 million to $60 million from the state budget next year and threaten the financial health of many of Connecticut's 242 nursing homes. Gov. M. Jodi Rell strongly opposes the idea, as she should.\n        In 2005 Governor Rell signed a state law written to take full advantage of the way the federal government reimburses states for Medicaid, the federal health care program for indigent people and the low-income elderly in nursing homes. Connecticut was not alone; 31 other states, and the District of Columbia, did the same thing in the last few years.\n        The new law allowed Connecticut to impose a tax of sorts on nursing homes that amounted to 6 percent on each Medicaid nursing home bed. The nursing homes paid the money to the state; the federal government matched the tax, dollar for dollar. Connecticut then reimbursed nursing homes for the tax they paid, and gave them most, but not all, of the federal matching money. The rest stayed in the state treasury to increase rates for group homes and the like.\n        The law -- obviously an accountant's dream -- was a win-win. The state got more money, and it helped restore 37 nursing homes to financial stability. But they could be back on the ropes again if the rules change.\n        The Bush administration now wants to limit federal exposure to no more than a 3 percent tax per bed. That would mean a cut of millions of dollars for nursing homes.\n        Nursing home care is so expensive that the majority of patients in the state quickly run through their assets and wind up dependent on Medicaid to pay for their care. There are fewer than 19,000 nursing home patients on Medicaid, but their care costs $1.2 billion. Policy solutions to this problem are scarce, and the dilemma will grow worse as the huge baby boomer generation ages.\n        The nation obviously needs a better way to pay for care of the elderly poor that does not depend on accounting gimmicks and shell games. But short of a solution, the least the federal government should do is to allow states like Connecticut to continue to operate under the current rules. These policies have a huge potential impact on an extremely frail population. Upending the rules to save the federal government money at the expense of eroding the care of the elderly poor is a profoundly bad idea.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1665894,"ids":1665894,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The Bush administration's choice to lead the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -- Michael Griffin -- sailed through the confirmation process last week.\n        In hearings before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, only Senator George Allen of Virginia was churlish enough to raise concerns about cuts in the aeronautics budget that could lead to job losses in his home state. The other members seemed intent on whisking Dr. Griffin through as fast as possible so that he could take the helm of the space agency as it prepares to resume shuttle flights. There is little doubt that the agency needs a firm hand at the top as it struggles to rebound from the Columbia tragedy, and Dr. Griffin, who has held a variety of jobs in the aerospace industry, looks eminently qualified.\n        In his love fest with the senators, Dr. Griffin showed an encouraging independence of mind and a willingness to abandon past NASA decisions that look increasingly myopic. Of immediate importance, he said he would not be bound by the decision of his predecessor, Sean O'Keefe, to abandon as too risky a planned astronaut servicing mission to extend the life of the Hubble Space Telescope, the agency's premier scientific instrument.\n        Cancellation of the astronaut mission on safety grounds never made much sense. Astronauts have already serviced the telescope several times without incident, and the revamped shuttles should be safer than in the past thanks to upgrades after the Columbia accident.\n        For the longer term, Dr. Griffin put his finger on a gaping hole in the nation's future space plans that has received little public attention. The aging shuttle fleet is scheduled to be retired in 2010 if not sooner, and the successor, known as the Crew Exploration Vehicle, is not expected to fly before 2014. That leaves a gap of four or more years when the country would have no independent means of sending astronauts aloft. We would be forced to rely on other nations, just as we now rely on Russia to ferry American astronauts to the space station and back. It took the fresh eye of Dr. Griffin to declare it unacceptable that this advanced technological nation, which in past years has developed major new spacecraft in just three to six years, would now dawdle nine years before being ready to launch the new one.\n        By definition and inclination, Dr. Griffin wholeheartedly supports the president's long-range space exploration plan, which would send astronauts back to the Moon and on to Mars. But he seems to think that NASA has ample funds to pursue more than one mission and calls it crucial to protect the agency's outstanding science programs.

But if the board is intended to be the administration's primary solution for the glaring weaknesses that have been revealed in the Food and Drug Administration's ability to protect patients from adverse effects that show up only after a drug is widely used, it will fall woefully short.\n        The administration's plan was unveiled on the eve of a three-day hearing to assess the safety of a heavily used class of painkillers called COX-2 inhibitors, which were thought to be safer than earlier painkillers but turned out to cause heart problems in some patients. Studies that pointed to possible risks remained hidden from patients and doctors, lost somewhere in the netherworld of confidential interactions within companies or between companies and the F.D.A.\n        That veil should begin to lift once the new drug safety oversight board, a part-time advisory panel, is up and running. The panel will be composed of government specialists, mostly from the drug agency with a smattering from other agencies. It will be charged with monitoring information that emerges about serious side effects and helping to resolve disputes over safety issues. The F.D.A. pledges to make information about possible dangers public promptly, even if the evidence is not yet conclusive. That should go a long way toward breaking the inertia that typically paralyzes the agency while it waits to accumulate conclusive evidence.\n        The most important reform, if it takes place, will be a promised change in attitude at the F.D.A.: from a passive stance, focused on protecting industrial trade secrets, to an aggressive stance, bent on getting information to the public. Once the information is out, doctors and patients can make their own decisions as to whether they want to back away from a drug or wait for more data.\n        Some critics have described the new board as a hoax or a farce because it will be tied to the center that approves drugs for marketing. Some safety officials within that center have long complained that their concerns are suppressed in the push to approve new drugs, so Congress may need to insist on a board with greater independence.\n        What's lacking, unfortunately, is a firm commitment to strengthen the power of the F.D.A. to act against drugs that have already won marketing approval. Little new money has been budgeted for aggressive monitoring. More important, the administration at this point has no plans to seek greater legal authority for the drug agency to demand that manufacturers perform postmarketing tests when safety concerns arise. The F.D.A. will have to rely mostly on the power of publicity when what it really needs is more legal muscle.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1839342,"ids":1839342,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Bush administration, facing Congressional pressure on trade, has lodged complaints against China three times in the last three months. The big question for trade policy and American businesses in particular is what happens next.\n        If the answer is a methodical working through of some of the difficult issues raised by a large and growing trade relationship, this could still prove to be a productive effort. But if these complaints add up to the hesitant first steps toward an all-out trade war with China, everyone will lose, including American workers, whom the White House and lawmakers say they are trying to protect.\n        The administration announced yesterday that it was filing two cases against China at the World Trade Organization. The first is over China's failure to crack down on pirated goods like movies and books. It will also challenge Chinese restrictions on the distribution of foreign films, music and more.\n        The move came less than two weeks after the Commerce Department said it would impose duties on two Chinese paper makers that it says got an unfair boost from China's government. Experts say such duties could expand to steel, plastic and beyond unless China reins in subsidies. In February, the U.S. opened another subsidy case at the W.T.O.\n        What must be avoided are the kinds of misunderstandings -- intensified by growing anti-China sentiment in this country -- that lead to tit-for-tat tariff reprisals until things spin out of control. A trade war would do more harm to American business than to China's subsidies. What would happen to Boeing if the steel used in its jets became more expensive? The last thing a country with a record trade deficit can afford is to hurt its exporters.\n        The administration's decision to get tough on China appears to be intended in part to soothe Congress's antitrade passions long enough to win approval of a new free-trade deal with South Korea that would be good for U.S. consumers and exporters. But the White House would do better if it educated Americans about free trade's benefits, which include cheaper clothes, televisions and cars, which hold down inflation. According to the Progressive Policy Institute, a Democratic research group, foreign manufacturers invest more in America than American manufacturers invest abroad.\n        It doesn't feel that way to workers, who know that their wages have stagnated and hear every day that overseas competition is to blame and that little has been done to help displaced workers. But China didn't break the piggy bank. President Bush and Congress did, with ill-conceived tax cuts for the wealthy and the war in Iraq.\n        If used correctly, pressures like the paper duties could help convince China's leadership that its businesses would be more efficient and its economy stronger if they were weaned off subsidies. But America must also invest a lot more at home, by educating its work force for the future, improving the infrastructure that manufacturers need and succoring the older line workers who cannot make the transition to one more career. That would do a lot more good than starting a trade war.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1642463,"ids":1642463,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The City Council finally got its one real shot at reshaping the Bloomberg administration's proposal to redevelop the Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan, and made it count. Although big pieces of the grand plan -- including the dreadful and overpriced football stadium for the Jets -- were long ago craftily placed outside its oversight, the Council managed to leverage its considerable power over rezoning.\n        The result is a better deal on affordable housing, as well as a savings of as much as $1 billion in financing costs. The plan, which Mayor Michael Bloomberg has accepted, demonstrates why still more public review of the administration's vision is needed.\n        The housing component of the compromise will ensure diversity and is a clear plus. Thanks to pressure from the Council and housing advocates, the administration's original formula for 16 percent in affordable housing was increased to an impressive 28 percent, 3 percent of which would be in existing buildings. When the goals are met, about 3,500 apartments will be reserved for New Yorkers making low, moderate and middle incomes, ranging from well under $50,000 to as much as $104,000 for a family of four. Builders of both rentals and condominiums must agree to include some of these units.\n        Current residents of the 59-block area will also reap rewards. Christine Quinn, who represents the West Side district in the Council, won a $14 million expansion of Public School 51, which will be needed to accommodate so many new families. Add in the proposed extension of the No. 7 subway line, and the components are falling in place to convert the farthest reaches of the West Side into a thriving neighborhood.\n        The Bloomberg administration had planned to borrow $4 billion to pay for all the improvements, and to delay payments on the debt until the development could begin producing tax revenue. Council Speaker Gifford Miller and the city comptroller, William Thompson, reasonably objected to that idea, which could have left the city piling up new interest obligations for years. Under the compromise plan, the city will borrow $3 billion and make payments earlier through its operating budget. The effect would be a savings of at least hundreds of millions of dollars.\n        New Yorkers should be happy that at last some public light has been shed on the West Side project, where plans have been proceeding for years within the Bloomberg administration with very little outside input. But not every part of the agreement was sunny. While commercial density was reduced about 14 percent, to 24 million square feet, that is still more than enough to make 11th Avenue rise like the Rockies, but without the picturesque slopes and peaks. River views would be hidden from the rest of the city.\n        And while the Council got an administration commitment that there will be no financial connection between the stadium and the rest of the West Side, the rezoning itself could be seen as a victory by stadium backers, who interpret any forward action on the West Side as movement toward their misguided goal.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1851918,"ids":1851918,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The City Council is poised to address some of the worst abuses of New York's otherwise progressive campaign financing system. If the legislation now being shepherded by Speaker Christine Quinn curbs the influence of powerful interests, it could set a new standard for clean local government. That's an exciting prospect: It is conservatively estimated that in 2005 more than one-fifth of campaign donations came from special interests like city contractors and lobbyists.\n        Reforming pay-to-play, as such influence buying is called, has long been a tantalizing goal. Until recently, though, databases to track those doing business with the city seemed out of reach. Improved technology has changed that, and now the biggest potential obstacle to reform is the City Council itself.\n        A majority of the Council's 51 members is needed to approve any new law, and many members seem to think that reform would hurt fundraising. In fact, reform would help protect the public financing system, under which council candidates can receive four times the amount of qualifying dollars they raise privately. Many council members would not be in office were it not for these funds.\n        However, the current system has flaws that erode public trust and need to be fixed. In addition to controlling pay-for-play, any serious reform should end the bundling of contributions, shut off the spigot that sends public money flowing to incumbents who face no real competition and hold self-funded candidates and those who opt out to strict spending accountability.\n        Right now, council members can accept up to $2,750 from city contractors; that figure could be capped at $250 or so, and applied to lobbyists and officers of companies and other influential individuals who seek $100,000 or more worth of business with the city. Given the power of the real estate industry in New York, it would also make sense to apply the new ceilings to anyone with land use issues before the council.\n        Proportionally higher caps should be set for contributions to candidates for higher city offices, which now rise to a hefty $4,950 per donor.\n        Since none of the capped donations under the new rules would be eligible for matching funds, it might help to get council members on board if the rules were coupled with bigger incentives for smaller amounts raised from everyday New Yorkers, perhaps by increasing the matching ratio.\n        Ms. Quinn has taken on a lot by trying to reform campaign finance while dealing with the city budget due by month's end.

A long-term modernization program to replace nearly all of the Coast Guard's ships, planes and helicopters -- begun four years ago in the wake of 9\/11 -- is foundering while its projected costs are skyrocketing. In Iraq, lax government oversight and incompetence or profiteering by contractors have disabled reconstruction efforts. Now the same disease is undermining our coastal defenses.\n        The Coast Guard fiasco was laid out in depressing detail by Eric Lipton in The Times last Saturday, and in a similar article in The Washington Post. The misjudgments and slipshod work would be grist for slapstick comedy if the consequences, in cost and weakened defenses, were not so serious.\n        As described by Mr. Lipton, the estimated costs of the project, known as Deepwater, have ballooned from $17 billion when it started in 2002 to $24 billion today. The plans call for 91 new ships, 124 small boats, 195 new or rebuilt helicopters and 49 unmanned aerial vehicles. But don't count on any of the new vehicles working.\n        The initial venture -- converting the Coast Guard's rusting patrol boats into bigger, more versatile cutters -- has been canceled because hull cracks and engine failures made the first eight ships unseaworthy. Plans for a new class of ships with an innovative hull design were halted after the design was found to be flawed. And even the radios placed in small open boats proved faulty; they shorted out because they had not been made waterproof.\n        In the latest chapter in this disgraceful performance, Mr. Lipton reports in today's paper that the Coast Guard did not inform Congress that it was warned two years ago by its chief engineer that a proposed National Security Cutter, meant to be the flagship of its fleet, had ''significant flaws'' in its structural design and should not be started until the problems were addressed. The Coast Guard began construction anyway. It plans to reinforce the first two versions that are being built and change the design on the remaining six.\n        How could this happen? Mostly because the Coast Guard, in an astonishing abdication of responsibility, gave two large military contractors, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, near total freedom to plan, supervise and deliver the new ships and helicopters. In some cases, the contractors made boneheaded decisions, as when their shipyard partner ignored warnings by Coast Guard engineers that the converted patrol boats might buckle under the extra weight. In other cases, they might have put their own interests ahead of the nation's, as when they adopted a risky hull material that had never been tried on a large American military ship but was pushed by Northrop, which had just opened a new plant to manufacture the hulls.\n        No wonder the contractors are ducking for cover as the scandal reverberates, and are leaving all comment to the hapless Coast Guard. The Coast Guard seems, belatedly, to be moving in the right direction by giving its own engineers more supervisory power over the work and creating a division to oversee procurement and maintenance of ships and planes. Even so, the new Congress and the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for the Coast Guard, will need to keep a sharp eye on the Coast Guard's performance. The industrial contractors have proved they were not up to the job.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1804258,"ids":1804258,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Democrats will not be able to savor their victory for long. Americans are waiting to hear if they have any good ideas for how to get out of Iraq without creating even wider chaos and terrorism.\n        Criticizing President Bush's gross mismanagement of the war was a winning electoral strategy. But criticism will not extricate the United States from this mess, nor will it persuade voters that the Democrats are ready to take back the White House.\n        Let us be clear. The responsibility for all that has gone wrong lies squarely with Mr. Bush. Even with control of the Congress, the Democrats' role in changing things will be hortatory. And while we too are eager to hear the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group -- better known as the (James) Baker commission -- it should be the start, and not the end, of a bipartisan discussion on Iraq strategy. The Democrats need to be ready to play a full role.\n        Under Republican control, Congress has exercised virtually no oversight of the administration's misconduct of the war, and the new Democratic leadership is eager to hold extensive hearings. The public deserves a full accounting (backed by subpoenas, if necessary) of how prewar intelligence was cooked, why American troops were sent to war without adequate armor, and where billions of dollars in reconstruction aid disappeared to.\n        The Democrats will also need to look forward -- and quickly. So far they have shared slogans, but no real policy. During the campaign, their most common call was for a ''phased redeployment'' -- a euphemism for withdrawal -- of American troops starting before the end of this year.\n        Threatening to pull out may be the only way to get cooperation from Iraq's prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, who is thwarting even the most limited American efforts to disarm militias and set timetables for genuine political compromise on the most fundamental issues, like protecting minority rights and fairly apportioning the country's oil wealth.\n        Unless America's exit plans are coupled with a more serious effort to build up Iraq's security forces and mediate its sectarian divisions, a phased withdrawal will only hasten Iraq's descent into civil war -- while placing American soldiers who remain behind in even greater danger. We also fear that Iraqis will have no interest in anything but retribution, until they see that security and rebuilding are possible. For that reason we have suggested one last push to stabilize Baghdad. That would require at least a temporary increase in American and Iraqi troops on Baghdad streets.\n        We are skeptical of calls, by some Democrats, to divide the country into three ethnically based regions. Most Iraqis -- except for the Kurds -- show little enthusiasm for the idea. And while there has been horrific ethnic cleansing, it hasn't yet got to the point that boundaries could be drawn without driving many more people from their homes.\n        Such ideas deserve a full discussion, something the United States has not had since its troops first rolled into Iraq. We are not sure that any shift in strategy can contain the disaster. But we are sure that even a few weeks more of drift and confusion will guarantee more chaos and suffering once American troops leave. Voters gave the Democrats the floor -- and are now waiting to hear what they have to say.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1709518,"ids":1709518,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The European Union and Japan can now claim to be way out in front in the race to see just how little the rich countries can get away with offering when it comes to making good on promises to liberalize farm trade. As negotiations at the World Trade Organization dragged on in Geneva this week, Japan and Europe both objected to American terms when the United States proposed cuts in farm subsidies. Japanese officials refused point-blank to consider the American proposal that Japan cut its own subsidies.\n        During the negotiations, the E.U. trade chief, Peter Mandelson, actually warned against trying to do too much, as if such a thing was possible. ''You have to be careful of overbidding in a round like this,'' Mr. Mandelson said, presumably with a straight face.\n        France, worried that its farmers may actually have to compete without having the government hold their hands, complained that Mr. Mandelson's go-slow approach was actually too fast. Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said he didn't like Mr. Mandelson's making offers to open access to the E.U.'s agriculture market ''without prior consultation with member states.'' This came after France slammed the American proposal.\n        So let's be realistic: the developed world funnels nearly $1 billion a day in subsidies to its own farmers, encouraging overproduction. That drives down prices and leaves farmers in poor nations unable to compete with subsidized products, even within their own countries.\n        In recent years, American farmers have been able to dump cotton, wheat, rice, corn and other products on world markets at prices that do not begin to cover their cost of production, all because of politicians -- and at the expense of American taxpayers. Europe's system is even worse: the United States' farm subsidies are equal to only a third of the European Union's.\n        The United States trade representative, Robert Portman, unveiled his proposal in Geneva on Monday to kick-start the farm trade talks, which are supposed to conclude -- or at least come close to concluding -- in December, when the W.T.O. has its big meeting in Hong Kong.\n        Mr. Portman's proposal is a step in the right direction. The United States would slash the allowable farm subsidies by 60 percent. In return, Europe and Japan would cut their subsidies by 83 percent -- a higher percentage because countries in Europe, along with Japan, have higher subsidies.\n        Mr. Portman's offer includes some economic pain for American farmers, particularly those who grow corn and soybeans. But it doesn't go far enough because it fails to address the long-term issues of declining commodity prices and the unchecked tendencies of some American farmers to overproduce because they know the United States government will bail them out.\n        Time is running out; the trade ministers have agreed to resume talks next week in Geneva. It is incumbent on developing countries to wring as much as they can from America and Europe on farm trade by using the leverage they have in these negotiations -- namely the fact that big business on both sides of the Atlantic dearly wants an overall deal that will liberalize rules and lower tariffs on manufactured products, agriculture and services. Poor countries should refuse to sign onto a new world trade pact until the United States, Europe and Japan drastically cut their farm subsidies.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1700572,"ids":1700572,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced this week that it didn't want the news media taking photographs of the dead in New Orleans. A FEMA spokeswoman talked unconvincingly about the dignity of the dead. But the bizarre demand, a creepy echo of the ban on news media coverage of the coffins returning from Iraq, is simply the latest spasm of a gutted federal agency.\n        It's not really all that surprising that the officials who run FEMA are stressing that all-important emergency response function called the public relations campaign. As it turns out, that's all they really have experience doing.\n        Michael Brown was made the director after he was asked to resign from the International Arabian Horse Association, and the other top officials at FEMA don't exactly have impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in emergency management either. The Chicago Tribune reported on Wednesday that neither the acting deputy director, Patrick Rhode, nor the acting deputy chief of staff, Brooks Altshuler, came to FEMA with any previous experience in disaster management. Ditto for Scott Morris, the third in command until May.\n        Mr. Altshuler and Mr. Rhode had worked in the White House's Office of National Advance Operations. The staff of that office decides where the president will stand on stage and which loyal supporters will be permitted into the audience -- and how many firefighters will be diverted from rescue duty to surround the president as he patrols the New Orleans airport trying to look busy. Mr. Morris was a press handler with the Bush presidential campaign. Previously, he worked for a company that produced Bush campaign commercials.\n        So when Mr. Brown finally got around to asking Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff for extra people for Katrina, it wasn't much of a departure for Mr. Brown to say that one of the things he wanted them to do was to ''convey a positive image of disaster operations to government officials, community organizations and the general public.'' We'd like them to stay focused on conveying food, water and medical help to victims.\n        Political patronage has always been a hallmark of Washington life. But President Bill Clinton appointed political pals at FEMA who actually knew something about disaster management. James Lee Witt, the former FEMA director whose tenure is widely considered a major success, was a friend of Mr. Clinton's when he took office in 1993, but he had run the Arkansas Office of Emergency Services. His top staff came from regional FEMA offices.\n        Surely there are loyal Republicans among the 50 directors of state emergency services. But President Bush chose to make FEMA a dumping ground for unqualified cronies -- a sure sign that he wanted to hasten the degradation of an agency that conservative Republicans have long considered an evil of big government. Katrina has proved that federal disaster help is vital, and that Mr. Brown and his team of advance men can't do the job. What America needs are federal disaster relief people who actually know something about disaster relief.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1773178,"ids":1773178,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Great South Bay, Long Island's own 45-mile lagoon, is not as great as it used to be. People have trashed it for generations, polluting its shallow waters and strip-mining its natural bounty. Its shellfish beds were once staggeringly immense, making Long Island clam seller to the nation, but those disappeared decades ago. Overzealous clamming took a heavy toll, and brown-tide algae didn't help.\n        On the surface, the bay is as pretty as ever, especially seen at sunset from the Robert Moses Causeway or the fishing pier at Captree State Park. There is plenty of wildlife, though it often comes in the form of party boats bristling with fishing rods and trailing wakes of cigarette butts and beer cans, or swarms of personal watercraft carving the water in a deafening ode to the joy of pointless aggression.\n        It's under water that things have looked especially bleak. The clam beds that crashed in the 1970's have not recovered. Much of the bay is a shellfish dead zone, and it may be too late to save. Filter-feeding bivalves like clams play such an important role in marine ecosystems that their long absence may have forever altered the bay's ecology.\n        But on the chance that things can be set right again, an ambitious experiment is trying to revive the Great South Bay with happy, healthy clams. In perhaps the largest shellfish-restocking effort ever, the Nature Conservancy has spent two years planting hundreds of thousands of clams on 13,000 acres it owns under the bay.\n        In some ways the task is as simple as tossing clams into the water, as Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy did on Wednesday, seeding the bay with the project's ceremonial millionth clam. He also announced a $1 million county grant to the program, which is similar to the county's efforts to restore the algae-devasted scallop fishery in Peconic Bay and Gardiners Bay, between the North and South Forks.\n        But the job is more complicated and difficult than just strewing shellfish. The Nature Conservancy has many years and millions more clams to go. There is still a lot to learn. Biologists have struggled to figure out exactly how and why all the bivalves disappeared, and why they didn't come back. The unprecedented scale of the reseeding effort, the vagaries of shellfish life cycles and the varied threats and stresses to the marine habitat make these projects something of a gamble.\n        But these are gambles we have to take. If Long Island is just one immense bedroom community, then it is only natural to look at its placid bays as backyard pools to be exploited for fun and profit. But if this is to be a natural place, too, with healthy, self-sustaining ecosystems, then people need to approach it in a whole new way. They need to think about putting things back, not just taking them out, and leaving some things alone. The work of groups like the Nature Conservancy -- not to mention all those clams -- will end up wasted if future generations are as heedless as ours has been.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1723471,"ids":1723471,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The House of Representatives passed two major tax-cut bills this week. One deserves to become law; the other deserves to die. It will be up to the Senate to make sure that happens.\n        On Wednesday, the House overwhelmingly passed a bill that would shield millions of taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax next year. The relief is expensive -- costing nearly $30 billion -- but it's critical. Without it, many middle-class Americans, who were never the intended target for the alternative tax, would be suddenly forced to pay higher taxes when they filed their 2005 tax returns. (The alternative tax was intended to stop rich people with lots of shelters from escaping their tax burden entirely, but it has not been changed to reflect inflation or the tax cuts passed under President Bush.)\n        The good news ended there. The House irresponsibly neglected to include any offsetting tax increases to help pay for the tax relief. (The Senate's tax bill includes $19 billion in offsetting tax increases.) Even more egregious, the House passed yet another tax bill a day later that would drain the Treasury of $56 billion of additional revenue over the next five years. Of that total, $21 billion would be used to extend, through 2010, special low tax rates for investors' dividends and capital gains. Those rates are set to expire at the end of 2008.\n        The extension is both unaffordable and gratuitous. Most of the benefits would flow to taxpayers who make more than $1 million a year. That's morally reprehensible at a time when the House and the Senate are moving toward an agreement to cut as much as $45 billion over five years from domestic programs like Medicaid, food stamps, student loans and child-support enforcement. And it comes at a time when the government is already borrowing extensively for all manner of undertakings, like the war in Iraq and the new prescription drug benefit for Medicare.\n        The Republican House leaders are also plotting to make it easier to get the unnecessary tax cuts for investors through the somewhat more responsible Senate. To date, moderate Senate Republicans have blocked the budget-busting investor tax breaks. The Senate tax bill, passed last month, includes alternative tax relief, but does not extend the preferential rates for investment income.\n        In a cagey maneuver, the House leaders have organized their legislation so the popular measure on the alternative minimum tax can stand on its own when it gets to the Senate, while the unwise tax reductions for investors can be inserted into a fast-track tax bill, which will, under special rules, be protected against any filibusters when it comes up for a final vote in the Senate. That will make it far easier for senators to abandon all restraint and vote for the House agenda.\n        It's not certain that the Senate will go along with this plan. The right course is clear: responsible senators should approve alternative minimum tax relief, but stand firm against machinations that would tart up the tax code with additional giveaways for the wealthiest Americans. Rampant tax cutting must be stopped in the face of deficits, looming budget obligations and the painful sacrifices being demanded of the poor.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1653088,"ids":1653088,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Hudson River Valley is not all sludge and smokestacks anymore, but neither is it pristine. Like the river itself, which reverses its flow with the tides, the region is slowly changing direction. Communities that turned their backs on the Hudson generations ago are now reclaiming the long-abused waterfront for a post-industrial age.\n        It is hard work, and progress is piecemeal. There is no overarching strategy. Towns and villages are working with developers on various projects, some better than others. The best will be those enriched by a sense of history, an abundance of ambition and a touch of dreamy audacity.\n        All three are present in a proposal by Scenic Hudson to restore the historic flow of the Pocantico River through a development planned for Sleepy Hollow, on the site of an abandoned General Motors plant. At nearly 100 acres, it is one of the biggest, most tempting parcels on the river, and thus presents one of the best opportunities to get this river rebirth thing right.\n        The developer, Roseland Properties of New Jersey, wants to build more than 1,500 condominiums or apartments, along with a hotel, restaurants, shops and a theater. With a historic lighthouse at one edge of the property and a county park next door, the development promises to be a milestone in the re-emergence of a greener, cleaner waterfront.\n        But Scenic Hudson wants to go the developers one better. It has offered them an alternative plan, one that cuts a path for the Pocantico River right through the old General Motors property, between the county-owned Kingsland Point Park and the Roseland development. Instead of skirting the park to the north, the Pocantico would barrel to the Hudson where its mouth used to be, before the area was lost to landfill and the G.M. factory went up.\n        It's bold and it might not work. But think of what it could mean:A restored Pocantico -- not a tamed rivulet trickling into the Hudson, but a healthy river and a new home for river-loving species of birds, mammals and plants. Better flood control, as the river and restored wetlands offer new outlets for storm runoff. Financial benefits for the developer, as homes and restaurants go up on the riverside, commanding premium prices. A lush, tree-strewn river walk for residents.\n        Roseland, which has worked closely with local officials and residents, has so far been dubious. The Scenic Hudson plan is sure to cost more, and making room for the river could mean 50 fewer housing units. On top of that, the site is a brownfield, and remediation might be too expensive. But the G.M. site is so big, and the project so important in the example it sets for the river valley in Westchester and beyond, that Scenic Hudson's proposal deserves serious study. We urge General Motors, Roseland Properties and Mayor Philip Zegarelli of Sleepy Hollow to considerwhether the new-river proposal might make a decent redevelopment plan even better.\n        As Scenic Hudson's president, Ned Sullivan, has argued, the decisions we make today in places like Sleepy Hollow will be felt for years to come. Recapturing the glory of the preindustrial Hudson River is an astoundingly difficult job -- all the more reason to set our hopes for it as high as possible.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1806601,"ids":1806601,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The International Atomic Energy Agency has always had a conflicted mandate. It is supposed to promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology while also restraining the spread of nuclear weapons. The problem is that some peaceful nuclear technology can be too easily used to make a weapon.\n        That dangerous duality is being played out again this week in Vienna, where the agency's board is debating whether its staff should provide Iran with technical advice on how to safely complete construction of a heavy water nuclear reactor near the town of Arak. Tehran says that it needs the reactor to produce medical isotopes. The United States and the Europeans suspect that what it really wants is the abundant plutonium that can be extracted from the reactor's spent fuel -- plutonium that could form the core of a nuclear weapon.\n        Denying the request should be a no-brainer -- especially at a time when Iran is defying a Security Council order that it stop enriching uranium, usable for nuclear reactor fuel or potentially a nuclear bomb. But Tehran is adept at whipping up the suspicions of the board's nuclear have-nots, who jealously guard their right to all civilian nuclear technology, no matter the potential dangers.\n        The board needs to soundly reject Iran's request. Anything less -- some members of the notoriously conflict-averse board are calling for deferring the decision -- will only confirm Tehran's belief that the international community is not serious about containing its nuclear ambitions.\n        Even more worrisome, the Security Council still cannot agree on how to punish Iran for continuing to enrich uranium -- nearly three months past a Council-ordered cutoff.\n        Moscow and Beijing, which have been protecting Tehran at the Council, need to focus less on Iran's oil wealth and more on the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran. The Bush administration, which has agreed to talk with Iran if it suspends enrichment, needs to go further, offering Tehran explicit security guarantees in exchange for giving up technology that could feed a nuclear weapons program.\n        Until there are real incentives and equally real punishments there is no chance of changing any minds in Tehran. The Arak episode is one more reminder of why the world needs to find a better way to guarantee countries the benefits of civilian nuclear technology without also dangling the temptations of nuclear weapons.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1666788,"ids":1666788,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has member organizations from more than 180 countries, but not Israel. Excluding Israel is wrong, and it diminishes the Red Cross movement's moral standing. But there is a real chance that under heavy pressure from the American Red Cross, the policy will change in the near future. For the sake of the Red Cross as much as Israel, it should.\n        The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies includes Red Cross organizations from North Korea, Iran and Cuba, but not from Israel. The reason it gives is that the corresponding Israeli society, Magen David Adom, uses the Jewish star as its emblem and will not adopt the red cross or red crescent, emblems that are recognized by the Geneva Conventions and the international Red Cross movement. Understandably, the Israelis do not want to adopt either of these emblems because they are heavy with religious meaning.\n        There is growing pressure on the Red Cross federation to change its policy. Since 2000, the American Red Cross has protested the discrimination against Israel by withholding $30 million in dues from the federation. Unless something changes before the 181 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies meet in November, the American Red Cross will have withheld its dues for five years. That means it could have its voting rights suspended, which would be a setback for both the American Red Cross and the international Red Cross movement.\n        The best solution would be for the umbrella organization, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, to drop both the cross and the crescent and to adopt a protective emblem with no religious connotation. It would be less divisive and safer for rescue workers, who are now in danger of being targeted because of the religious symbolism of the emblem they operate under. It seems unlikely that the Red Cross movement will switch to a single emblem anytime soon, but it is working on a plan that could allow Israel to join.\n        It is considering adding a protective emblem devoid of religious connotations, known as the red crystal, which could be adopted by Israel and by other nations that do not want to use the cross or the crescent. But there are a series of procedural hurdles that must be jumped over, starting with amending the Geneva Conventions. Switzerland, the official depository of the Conventions, is now sounding out the 191 signatory nations to see whether there is enough support for the change.\n        If the Geneva Conventions are amended, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which includes the federation, would then have to change its statutes to recognize the new emblem.\n        Despite all the talk of emblems, it is politics that have impeded Israel's entry. That situation puts the Red Cross movement in an unfortunate position. The International Committee of the Red Cross, the arm of the movement that works in conflict zones and visits prisoners, often finds itself urging nations to put politics aside and do the right thing, such as in its current work on behalf of the detainees at the American prison in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. It will be in a better position to make these moral appeals when it can show that it is part of a movement that does what is right, rather than what is politically expedient, when it comes to running its own shop.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1827562,"ids":1827562,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The Iraq war has plunged the Army into a vicious cycle of declining standards. Multiple, extended tours of duty have sapped morale and blighted recruiting. New plans for a larger overall force could reduce pressures but would also mean that recruiters would have to meet higher quotas.\n        To keep filling the ranks, the Army has had to keep lowering its expectations. Diluting educational, aptitude and medical standards has not been enough. Nor have larger enlistment bonuses plugged the gap. So the Army has found itself recklessly expanding the granting of ''moral waivers,'' which let people convicted of serious misdemeanors and even some felonies enlist in its ranks.\n        Last year, such waivers were granted to 8,129 men and women -- or more than one out of every 10 new Army recruits. That number is up 65 percent since 2003, the year President Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq. In the last three years, more than 125,000 moral waivers have been granted by America's four military services.\n        Most of last year's Army waivers were for serious misdemeanors, like aggravated assault, robbery, burglary and vehicular homicide. But around 900 -- double the number in 2003 -- were for felonies. Worse, the Army does no systematic tracking of recruits with waivers once it signs them up, and it does not always pay enough attention to any adjustment problems. Without adequate monitoring and counseling, handing out guns to people who have already committed crimes poses a danger to the other soldiers they serve with and to the innocent civilians they are supposed to protect.\n        There is a long and honorable history of young people who have had minor scrapes with the law joining the military and successfully turning their lives around. But those who have committed more serious crimes, especially those involving weapons, vehicular homicide or sexual abuse, should generally be denied moral waivers. And those who do qualify for waivers should be monitored, counseled and carefully supervised.\n        The fastest way to drop the rate of moral waivers would be for the Army to rebuild its recently tarnished reputation among less problematic young Americans. That will require an end to involuntarily extended tours of duty and accelerated, multiple redeployments into combat. The military is America's face to much of the world.

He hoped in that way to strengthen Mahmoud Abbas, the embattled moderate who presides over the Palestinian Authority. Unfortunately, Israel's defense minister, Amir Peretz, has undercut these moves by approving the first new West Bank settlement in more than a decade.\n        Israel's space for peace diplomacy is tightly constrained. It must reckon with a Hamas-led Palestinian cabinet that denies its right to exist and rejects the very notion of a negotiated peace. Yet those facts of Mideast life do not justify authorizing a new settlement. That self-defeating move adds nothing to Israel's security and needlessly complicates the quest for an eventual negotiated peace.\n        We hope Mr. Olmert or Israel's Parliament can reverse Mr. Peretz's damaging decision, taken in defiance of the international road map for Middle East peace, which Israel's governing coalition has pledged to support.\n        Meanwhile, Mr. Olmert's positive gestures still deserve recognition, although the hoped-for benefits to Mr. Abbas may now be lost. More than two dozen military checkpoints in the West Bank will be removed and Israel will take steps to ease the passage of goods in and out of the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip. These steps should reduce the day-to-day humiliation and economic suffering of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Palestinians.\n        In addition, Israel will turn over $100 million of the $500 million in Palestinian tax revenue it has withheld since Hamas came to power. This page supports freezing aid to the Hamas government. But tax revenue to which the Palestinians are legally entitled should never have been withheld.\n        Compared to the sweeping visions of the Oslo peace agreements, or Ariel Sharon's bold Gaza withdrawal, Mr. Olmert's gestures look modest. Yet in today's unpromising circumstances, with Mr. Olmert damaged by the Lebanon war and Mr. Abbas so far unable to nudge Hamas toward moderation, they approach the limits of the possible. Unfortunately, it has become traditional in Israel to balance constructive gestures with sops to the politically potent settlers movement. The settlers' agenda is not supported by a majority of Israelis. But no recent government has felt strong enough to resist their demands. Even when Mr. Sharon faced them down over Gaza, he compensated them with promises to expand existing West Bank settlements. Mr. Peretz has gone one regrettable step further by approving a wholly new settlement whose aim is to relocate settlers uprooted from Gaza last year.\n        Today, the idea of a comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians seems a distant dream. Yet it represents the best long-term assurance of Israel's survival as a secure Jewish democracy at peace with its Arab neighbors.

Oregon law allows terminally ill people to take lethal drugs to end their lives. But the Bush administration has tried to override this law by threatening to prosecute doctors involved in such cases. The Supreme Court should make it clear that Oregon can allow doctor-assisted suicide.\n        Oregonians voted in favor of the Death With Dignity Act in 1994, and three years later they voted against repeal. The Oregon law allows terminally ill people who are likely to die within six months to receive drugs to end their lives. When John Ashcroft, a longtime opponent of assisted suicide, became attorney general in 2001, he issued an edict that doctors who prescribe drugs that are used to commit suicide can be prosecuted under the federal Controlled Substances Act. The state of Oregon and a group of terminally ill patients challenged this Ashcroft directive and won.\n        This case nominally involves two hot-button issues: the right of terminally ill people to end their lives, and the allocation of power between the federal government and states. But the Court of Appeals was right to resolve it more simply, through a careful interpretation of the Controlled Substances Act. Mr. Ashcroft claimed that the law gave him the power to overrule Oregon's assisted suicide policy. But when Congress passed the act, it clearly intended to prohibit ordinary drug abuse, not to set out a federal policy on assisted suicide.\n        Opponents of assisted suicide have never been able to persuade Congress to outlaw assisted suicide directly. In the absence of a Congressional law, Mr. Ashcroft had no authority to interfere with the decision of Oregon's voters.\n        In his zeal to stop assisted suicide, Mr. Ashcroft, a self-described legal conservative, turned his back on two principles that are sacred to legal conservativism. First, he refused to strictly, or even accurately, construe a Congressional statute. Instead, he inserted meaning in it that did not belong there, giving himself power that he should not have had. Second, he ignored conservative dogma about deference to the states, especially on matters like regulating medical practice, a core state concern.\n        The impact of today's case will be felt beyond Oregon. The Bush administration's position has discouraged other states from enacting assisted suicide laws. But the Supreme Court should make clear that Oregon, and all states, have the right to allow terminally ill people to end their lives with a maximum of dignity and a minimum of pain.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1698568,"ids":1698568,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Likud Party has long been one of Israel's most powerful political movements, a home for right-wing nationalists who champion Jewish settlements on Arab lands captured in the 1967 war.

They are the reason the party became so conservative that even its uncompromising pit bull of a leader, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, the architect of Israel's settlement expansion, has moved to the left of most Likud members.\n        In announcing yesterday that he will challenge Mr. Sharon for the leadership of Likud, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is forcing a battle for the heart and soul of the party. Will it be a political movement capable of standing up for all Israelis? Or will Likud continue to be beholden to the ultra-right-wing elements that choose to ignore the very real truth that Israel will never find security until it makes peace with the 2.4 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank?\n        Make no mistake: Ariel Sharon is no peacenik. It was Mr. Sharon, as defense minister, who orchestrated the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which cost more than 17,000 lives, most of them Palestinian and Lebanese. It was Mr. Sharon who -- in posts like minister of trade and industry, minister of housing, and minister of national infrastructure in various Likud governments -- expanded and fortified Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, building roads, negotiating water rights and defending clearly illegal settlements. And Mr. Sharon was again the defense minister when Israeli soldiers stood by and did nothing as Christian Phalangists raided the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila, killing hundreds of civilians.\n        But now is a different time, and in the current reality of the Middle East, Mr. Sharon has just boldly gone where Mr. Netanyahu fears to tread. Mr. Sharon's withdrawal of Israeli settlers from Gaza, completed last week, was a historic shift that should be acknowledged and extended.\n        Now that Mr. Sharon has demonstrated that he is able to carry out a territorial compromise, a necessity if there will ever be any chance for peace, he needs to extend the principle from Gaza to the crucially important West Bank.

Two are saloons, one is a wine shop, and the rest are simple ice-filled plastic bins next to the magazine racks and popcorn machines. The bins overflow with cans, bottles and, for the powerhouse drinker, 24-ounce aluminum hogsheads. A $10 bill will buy you so many supersize Budweisers that the clerk has to double the plastic shopping bag, leaving just enough change for popcorn.\n        The easy abundance of alcohol makes the Long Island Rail Road's old tradition of selling beer and mixed drinks on train platforms look hopelessly redundant -- not so much a needed convenience as an all-out effort to make sure absolutely no one gets on board without the opportunity for a good, early buzz. If you ride the railroad often, you know how little -- or how seldom -- it seems to think of you, the customer. But in this one area -- unlike those having to do with lateness, dirty cars, broken toilets and cellphone idiots -- the railroad is quite sensitive to a rider's needs. A drinking rider's, that is.\n        Which raises a question: What about everyone else, especially those who hate riding in filthy cars with loud, sloppy drunks, hearing the ugly slurch of shoe soles on sticky train floors and dodging rolling bottles and tributaries of beer foam? There seems to be enough alcohol spilling around without the railroad adding to it.\n        Mitch Pally, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority board member, recently floated the idea of banning alcohol outright on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North. His concern was for safety, since drunken riders presumably turn into drunken drivers. His proposal has been banished to task-force land, where it will presumably die. The idea of a dry commuter railroad has many enemies, particularly at Metro-North, which has a longstanding fleet of bar cars and recently ordered new ones.\n        It may be impossible to turn the commuter railroads, like the New York City subways, into alcohol-free zones. Too many riders treasure a cold beer (or two or three) as a small balm for the indignities of a hard workday and long commuting trip.\n        Going dry would be a huge cultural shift. But the same used to be said about smoking cars, and we doubt that many riders nowadays pine for the return of those rolling hazmat wagons, except for the jittery people who cluster by the doors long before their stops, fingering their lighters and cigarette packs.\n        Yes, the commuting life is saturated in alcohol. But there is no compelling reason that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority should be part of it. It should forgo the paltry income from its liquor operations -- about $350,000 a year -- and focus on improving its other operations. To put it another way: a railroad that cannot keep its bathrooms clean should probably not be selling beer.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1780954,"ids":1780954,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The Long Island landscape is haunted by the ghosts of power plants that died on the drawing board -- or, in the case of the Shoreham nuclear plant, by actual skeletal remains. This is why the approval of a new plant late last month by the Brookhaven Town Board was something remarkable.\n        The plant, a project of the Manhattan-based company Caithness Energy, would generate 350 megawatts of electricity, enough to supply about 10 percent of Long Island's current annual demand. Its proposed 15-acre site, in South Yaphank, south of Exit 66 on the Long Island Expressway, does not threaten protected pine barrens or drinking water or too many people's backyards, and thus has not generated the critical mass of community opposition that so often sends new industrial projects on Long Island -- anything that includes a smokestack, basically -- into limbo or oblivion.\n        The Caithness plant is not a perfect solution. It is to be built on a previously undeveloped greenfield, which is never ideal on an island where open space is precious and dwindling. And while its primary fuel, natural gas, burns much more cleanly than coal or oil, it is still a greenhouse-gassy fossil fuel, which makes the plant only an interim step on the path to a sustainable energy future.\n        But the plant makes sense for the town and the region. Brookhaven's supervisor, Brian Foley, and a majority of its Town Board -- including two members, Kathleen Walsh and Timothy Mazzei, who switched their opposing votes to enable the plan to clear a final town hurdle -- deserve credit for recognizing this. No doubt their support was bolstered by a $150 million incentive package from the Long Island Power Authority that included last-minute deal-sweeteners in the form of money for a community center and for local public schools.\n        But while opponents of the Caithness project may have a lingering distaste at how the deal was finally struck, the fact remains that Long Island needs the power. The heat waves that have baked the region and caused infuriating and deadly blackouts this summer have only underscored the need for abundant energy and a sturdy power grid.\n        The other argument for Caithness is environmental. Compared with existing plants, particularly Keyspan's belching dinosaurs in Port Jefferson and Northport, the Caithness plant is expected to be a model of efficiency and cleanliness. And while that is all well and good, the Caithness plant will also help the environment in an indirect but no less significant way -- by allowing utilities to clean up Caithness's older, dirtier counterparts.\n        The Long Island Power Authority and Keyspan, which owns many of the old, dirty gas-and-oil plants on Long Island, have dragged their feet for years on ''repowering'' existing plants -- that is, shutting them down to install newer technology that will supply far more energy with far less pollution. An argument against repowering has been that the overstressed power grid could not handle demand during the 12 to 18 months that a plant like Northport's would have to be shut down.\n        Environmental advocates and energy experts who have pressed for repowering have doubted that claim. The promise of a new 350 megawatts from the Caithness plant now undercuts that argument even more, and makes the need for a commitment to repowering by LIPA and Keyspan more of a no-brainer than ever.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1853521,"ids":"1853521,1853566","split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- worried, in part, about sloppy drunks bothering other passengers and being menaces on the drive home from the train station -- recently entertained the idea of prohibiting the sale or use of alcohol on Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road trains.\n        But the forces of commuter conviviality are apparently far stronger than any agency's nanny impulse. William Neuman reported in The Times recently that a committee of the authority's board had recommended keeping the alcohol status quo, given the ''overwhelmingly negative response'' it received from riders about the proposed ban.\n        It is likely that the full board will follow the committee's recommendations, and that life aboard the 7:22 to Huntington or the 6:42 to New Haven will roll along, as merry as always.\n        Merriness is only part of it.

''It's one of the things that makes this slog north or east palatable,'' said one rider, Richard Shea, a public relations executive who helped start an advocacy group to preserve his right to a Bud Light on the 6:52 to Chappaqua.\n        He and fellow members of the group, Commuters Allied for Responsible Enjoyment, argued that it was unfair to take away their sociable beers just to prevent the falling-down drunks who stumble into cars after concerts and sports events and the hard-core drinkers who usually get their buzz before they get the train. They have a point. One side effect of stressful workdays made more so by long, arduous commuting trips is that people feel the need to use the train time -- an hour or more -- for rapid, chemically accelerated decompression.\n        This page has been skeptical of the authority's eagerness to profit from that demand, using its employees as rolling booze merchants while neglecting the litter and loudness that on-board drinking brings.\n        But as long as people's rides are punctuated by miseries -- late trains, cold trains, hot trains, dirty trains, squawking announcements or no announcements -- it seemed heartless of the authority to go completely dry, depriving all riders the pleasure of a homebound beer. That argument apparently was clinched by the lack of evidence that train-borne alcohol fuels a detectable pattern of drunken driving or other mayhem.\n        In a better world, commuting would not be so miserable that riders would feel the need to make a beeline for the bartender or schlep aboard with multiple cans of Foster's Lager in doubled-up plastic bags just to make it home. But this is the world we live in, so it seems hardly right to stamp out the rituals that make it bearable -- as when tightly wound men and women loosen up in the packed but friendly confines of a rush-hour bar car, playing cards, socializing and rolling along into the night.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1653630,"ids":1653630,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Microsoft chairman Bill Gates was on the mark when he described the American high school system as ''obsolete,'' compared with education abroad, adding that the American system was undermining the work force of the future -- and ''ruining the lives of millions of Americans every year.'' The governors made the right response, announcing that they had formed a coalition that would adopt higher standards, more rigorous courses and tougher examinations. The burning question of the moment, however, is whether the governors who applauded Mr. Gates in Washington will revert to the bad old status quo once they get home.\n        The tendency among the states to embrace the lowest common denominator in education has been especially evident since Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act, which required the states to place a ''highly qualified teacher'' in every classroom and administer yearly tests in the early grades with the aim of closing the achievement gap between rich and poor students.\n        Many states have taken the easy way out by embracing obfuscation and mediocrity at just about every juncture. Many have simply redefined the existing teacher corps as ''highly qualified,'' regardless of whether the teachers have mastered the subjects they teach. Many have reported graduation and dropout rates that are clearly inaccurate to keep the public from knowing how poorly the schools are actually performing. A dismaying Carnegie Foundation report entitled ''Reading Next'' shows that the states have set the reading achievement bar very low so students can be moved from grade to grade -- even though about 70 percent enter the first year of high school reading below grade level.\n        Given the facts, it should come as no surprise that American high school students are losing ground compared with their peers abroad, and now score near the bottom in the industrialized world. The problem, as Mr. Gates pointed out in his incendiary speech, is the American high school system itself, which was never designed for the purpose of providing high-quality education for all of its students. On the contrary, it was created to send an elite to college while keeping the other students off the streets until they were old enough for unskilled farm and factory jobs. Those jobs have largely disappeared. But the high schools remain, and changing them will require more than a few pledges made at a conference in Washington. The governors will have to speak some hard truths to the voters about the demands that will have to be made on students and teachers, as well as taxpayers. In other words, the high school reform can succeed only if the governors are willing to expend real political capital.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1835422,"ids":1835422,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Nassau County Clerk, Maureen O'Connell, did not invent or install the alarmingly creaky administrative systems and procedures that her office uses to do its job. But she has run the place since 2006, long enough to assume the brunt of responsibility for the appalling weaknesses revealed in an audit of her office released last week by Howard Weitzman, the county comptroller.\n        The audit found that the County Clerk's office is essentially a mom-and-pop shop lacking basic financial controls and oversight, with an approach to accounting that is less sophisticated than that of many small businesses and utterly ill-suited to a government department that handles $300 million a year in revenues.\n        Mr. Weitzman did not accuse Ms. O'Connell or anyone else in her office of committing or countenancing fraud. But he pointed out that fraud -- not to mention honest mistakes -- would be impossible to detect, given the office's essential lack of a functioning accounting system.\n        His investigators found, among other things, that a lone deputy clerk had responsibility for almost all the office's financial dealings, receiving and investing money, transferring funds and recording transactions without any oversight or backup staff. Cashiers were allowed to waive or reduce fees and taxes without getting a supervisor's approval or recording the reason. As for written policies and procedural manuals to govern how the office handles cash and keeps its books -- they aren't used, Mr. Weitzman said, because they don't exist.\n        Ms. O'Connell's immediate response to the audit was defensive. She blamed the county for not giving her the money to hire enough staff and accused Mr. Weitzman, a Democrat, of waging a partisan attack against one of the few Republicans left in Nassau County government.\n        Her arguments do not hold up. For one thing, the audit was begun during her predecessor's tenure and was kept confidential by Mr. Weitzman so that it would not influence the recent special-election campaign for a state Senate seat between Ms. O'Connell and the Democrat who won, Craig Johnson. Her complaints about staffing might have had more credibility had she initiated reforms -- or plans for reforms -- sooner and not resisted cooperating with Mr. Weitzman's investigators, imposing what he called ''strict'' and ''unjustified'' limitations on their research.\n        ''No other county agency has forbidden our auditors from observing normal operations directly or speaking freely with employees,'' Mr. Weitzman said, ''but that's what's occurred here.''\n        The inefficiencies and inadequacies of Nassau County government swelled to grotesque proportions during decades of Republican misrule, and Mr. Weitzman's audit makes it clear that the clerk's office is a holdover from that misbegotten era. Clearly many of the problems predate Ms. O'Connell, but she should have started attacking them long ago.\n        Mr. Weitzman is right to have blown the whistle, and the State Comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, should heed his call to follow up with a comprehensive audit, not only in Nassau but in county clerks' offices all over the state. Meanwhile, Ms. O'Connell, who lost her bid for a job in Albany last month, has her work cut out for her at home.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1647479,"ids":1647479,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The New York Jets didn't make it to the Super Bowl, but the Jets' front office has been running with the ball in its drive to build a riverfront stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan. Now the team and its supporters are facing a blocking action from a longtime rival, and it's time to call a temporary halt.\n        At issue are the development rights for the space over a 13-acre rail yard controlled by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The M.T.A. asked for $300 million for the rights -- well below an appraisal of about $900 million. Still, the Jets said they would pay $100 million. Although the authority desperately needs to maximize every possible source of money, it was ready to go to arbitration with the Jets' low-ball offer. That's when another player, Madison Square Garden, entered the game this weekend.\n        The Garden, which is owned by Cablevision, said it would pay $600 million to build a mixed-use development on the parcel. That price would include development rights and money to put a platform over the rail yards there. But the deal would still net about $350 million for the M.T.A. And it would save taxpayers $600 million in public funds that the city and state would have to ante up to build the sturdier platform and roof that would be needed for the Jets project.\n        It's conceivable that the new offer is just an effort to thwart the stadium -- which Madison Square Garden regards as competition. But it should provide ammunition for critics who never liked the Jets deal. And while the new controversy may put a damper on New York's efforts to woo the 2012 Olympics, that's no reason for rushing. Like most New Yorkers, we would be happy to see the Olympic Games come to the city. But the price would be too high if it included a stadium that costs $600 million in public money, deprives the M.T.A. of potential revenue and puts a very large and unattractive football stadium on a prime riverside site.\n        Even the announced redesign of the stadium doesn't make it a more appealing component of a redeveloped Far West Side. The primary issue was never the looks of the facility -- although it is now less hulking. New York simply doesn't need the stadium and cannot afford to give away the store to the Jets.

As part of a broader $54 million settlement largely engineered by the fund, 10 former directors of the telecommunications giant WorldCom have agreed to fork over $18 million of their own money to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by the fund and other angry investors who lost hundreds of millions of dollars when the company collapsed in 2002, the largest bankruptcy in history.\n        WorldCom is an extreme example of what can happen if a board utterly fails to do its duty. Bernard Ebbers, the swashbuckling founder, was allowed to manage the company as a personal fiefdom. Among other shenanigans, WorldCom failed to deduct billions in expenses and was eventually forced to restate its results for 2000 and 2001, reducing its pretax income by an astonishing $74 billion.\n        Directors as well as company officers have almost always relied on company insurance to bail them out in situations like this. But the retirement fund and the other plaintiffs appear to have insisted from the start that any negotiated settlement include a penalty that would personally hurt board members in their wallets -- the very wallets they sat on while Mr. Ebbers ran the company into the ground. As Gretchen Morgenson's account of the negotiations in The Times made clear, the plaintiffs were just as interested in sending a signal to complacent boards of directors elsewhere as they were in recovering losses, which in the case of the retirement fund amounted to $300 million.\n        One downside to the settlement is that the effort to frighten away the bad actors that still exist in corporate America could deter talented people from ever getting involved. This would run counter to the interests of investors, Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the stock exchange, all of whom have been asking for a greater role for independent directors.\n        But this concern is outweighed, in our view, by the benefits. The WorldCom settlement will make boards elsewhere sit up and take notice. Lazy or incompetent board members, who in the past might have happily coasted along forever, enjoying the rewards of their post without doing the work, may decide to steer clear of a role that could expose them to financial penalties.\n        In strictly financial terms, no settlement is ever going to make bilked investors whole or anywhere near it. What will protect investors are boards that are effective in overseeing the companies they govern -- who ask tough questions and do not ignore red flags that could prevent disasters like Enron and WorldCom from happening in the first place.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1838667,"ids":1838667,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The New York State Legislature passed a practically on-time budget last week with a lot in it to be happy about.

But that doesn't mean Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Mayor Michael Bloomberg should delay a tough examination of the amateur videos showing those marches. As Jim Dwyer wrote in The Times this week, there are at least two cases of disturbing discrepancies between videos provided by protesters and testimony by the police.\n        In one case, a police officer testified that he'd had to help haul Dennis Kyne, a protester, down the steps of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue because Mr. Kyne had been ''kicking and refusing to walk on his own.'' A bystander's video shows that Mr. Kyne clearly walked on his own down the steps. Alexander Dunlop, who said he'd been arrested on his way to pick up sushi, found that the police video used against him in court had been edited in two places, removing footage backing his account. Charges against both men have been dropped.\n        Video evidence is clearly an important addition to the search for truth in today's courtroom. For the 1,800 people arrested last summer, most of the charges were dropped. About 400 have provided independent videos in their defense. The videos provide protection -- for the police against false brutality complaints and for the defendants against false disorderly conduct charges.\n        In this case, the elaborate testimony against Mr. Kyne shows that police officers don't always get it right. Maybe the officer was confused. Maybe, as the police conjecture, the event described by the policeman happened at a different time. Or maybe this is a throwback to the not-so-distant days when police officers fashioned their testimony to fit the crime. As for the edited video, the police say they passed it along, unedited, to the district attorney's office. A spokesman for that office, Barbara Thompson, said it had been cut by a technician by mistake.\n        The Bloomberg administration says the police handled the protesters with model restraint; there have been no charges of brutality, no videos of a nightstick raised in anger. And that model behavior came when Republicans were gathering in a Democratic city still nervous about terrorism. New York protesters also got close to the event -- unlike those in Boston, who were penned inside barbed wire.\n        Commissioner Raymond Kelly says that having a thousand eyes on the police is a good thing -- with videos of any event now routinely coming from the police, the press and ordinary citizens. Even the army of people with cellphone cameras aimed at the police has a ''salutary effect,'' he says. Those are comforting answers. But the police successes do not overshadow the need to take a careful look at complaints about unnecessary arrests and extraordinarily long waits for hearings, or at how things went awry during protests last summer.

It was with that goal in mind that Congress specified for the first time that in return for federal education dollars, states would have to end the destructive practice of staffing schools serving poor and minority children with disproportionate numbers of inexperienced and unqualified teachers.\n        The U.S. Department of Education soft-pedaled the teacher quality requirement in the early years, probably because of pressure from the states. But as of this month, states and districts that wish to keep receiving federal school aid must file plans with the Department of Education explaining how they intend to reach the teacher quality goal. Meanwhile, the importance of that goal was just underscored by a nonpartisan Washington think tank, the Education Trust, in a study on the effects of teacher training and experience on student performance.\n        Skeptics have often expressed doubt that good teachers would make any difference in the lives of the country's poorest students, who typically show up in first grade not at all prepared to learn. The Education Trust study, which draws on a treasure-trove of data from several states, clearly refutes this notion. The most important data set comes from Illinois, where researchers scrutinized the work and qualifications of 140,000 teachers, all of whom were assigned quality ratings based on several indicators, including where they attended college and how much experience they had.\n        The Illinois study found teacher quality mattered a great deal in high-poverty high schools, where students with highly rated teachers were about twice as likely to meet state standards as similarly situated students elsewhere. Teacher quality even trumped course content, and it did not take paragons of achievement to make the difference. For example, students who took Algebra II at schools with average teacher quality ratings turned out to be better prepared for college than students who had completed calculus at schools with low teacher ratings.\n        Taken together, the multistate data cited in the study show that teacher experience makes a profound difference in student performance, as do teacher literacy levels. The facts are especially clear when it comes to the crucial areas of math and science, where teachers who have majored in the subject areas generate better student performance than those who majored in outside areas.\n        To improve student performance, the states need to play a much stronger role in teacher training and certification -- and in making sure that qualified teachers are evenly spread across their school districts. Breaking with the bad old status quo won't be easy. But it's the only way for the country to improve the educational picture for the poor and minority students who will make up such a large part of the work force of the future.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1810261,"ids":1810261,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The No Child Left Behind education act, which requires the states to close the achievement gap between rich and poor students in exchange for federal aid, has been under heavy fire since it was passed five years ago. Critics, some of whom never wanted accountability in the first place, have ratcheted up their attacks in anticipation of Congressional hearings and a reauthorization process that could get under way soon after the new Congress convenes in January.\n        Those critics were empowered by a spate of recent studies showing that the nation has made slight overall progress in closing the achievement gap since the law went into effect. (A handful, including New York and New Jersey, are said to have made moderate progress.) The data has been seized upon as evidence that Congress set the bar too high.\n        Generally, the opponents do not argue that impoverished children can never be educated up to the same standards as the wealthy. They simply say it will take much longer than the law permits. In the world of education reform, where ambitious programs generally last only as long as it takes for the schools to fail to meet the first target, endless deferral of deadlines would be a death knell for No Child Left Behind.\n        And the country can't afford that. Unless we improve schools -- especially for minority children who will make up the work force of the future -- we will fall behind our competitors abroad who are doing a better job of educating the next generation.\n        It's impossible to brand No Child Left Behind as a failure, because its agenda has never been carried out. The law was supposed to remake schools that serve poor and minority students by breaking with the age-old practice of staffing those schools with poorly trained and poorly educated teachers. States were supposed to provide students with highly qualified teachers in all core courses by the beginning of the current academic year. That didn't happen.\n        The country would be much further down the road toward complying with No Child Left Behind if the Department of Education had given the states clear direction and the technical assistance they needed. Instead, the department simply ignored the provision until recently and allowed states to behave as though the teacher quality problem did not exist. Thanks to this approach, the country must now start from scratch on what is far and away the most crucial provision of the law.\n        Getting up to speed will not be easy. Most states lack even the most basic systems for overseeing teacher training and the teacher assignment process. Worse still, the practice of dumping poorly qualified teachers into the schools that serve the poorest, neediest children has become second nature in many places.\n        The battle for teacher quality is just getting under way. The country can either win that battle or watch its fortunes fade as the national work force becomes less and less competitive. Given what's at stake, the teacher quality provision of No Child Left Behind deserves to be at the very top of the list when Congress revisits the law.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1816526,"ids":1816526,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The No. 2 job in the State Department is technically a step down from John Negroponte's present post of director of national intelligence.

What he doesn't have, unfortunately, is much of a reputation for challenging the unwise policy presumptions of his bosses.\n        In his 10 months in Baghdad from mid-2004 to mid-2005, Mr. Negroponte undoubtedly saw the yawning gap between Iraq's grim reality and the delusional claims of success issuing from Washington. While President Bush and other top officials trumpeted effective military training programs, a flowering Iraqi democracy and an insurgency ever on its last legs, anyone on the ground had to see paper Iraqi battalions, the rise of sectarian militias and ever-expanding chaos.\n        If Mr. Negroponte made a serious effort to jolt his bosses back to the real world, there is no public record of it.

Mr. Rumsfeld's replacement, Robert Gates, a former director of central intelligence, will have the credibility -- and we hope the will -- to calm those rivalries and improve interagency coordination. Even then, Mr. Bush must quickly find a credible replacement for Mr. Negroponte, preferably one who is willing to jolt his bosses with the truth.

It would also make it difficult for Congress, and the public, to know whether the F.B.I. was abusing its enormous new powers.\n        Defenders of the bill argue that a subpoena could still be challenged in court, but this is a hollow right. In many cases, the person whose records would be turned over -- who has the greatest incentive to fight the subpoena -- would not know what was going on. The record holder, who would be in a position to challenge the subpoena, may have little incentive to spend the money and time to do so.\n        The bill's defenders note that administrative subpoenas are already allowed in other kinds of investigations. But these are generally in highly regulated areas, like Medicaid billing. The administrative subpoena power in the new bill would apply to anything the F.B.I. deemed related to alleged foreign intelligence or terrorism, and could, in practice, give the F.B.I. access to almost any private records it wanted.\n        The proposed new administrative subpoena power is a solution in search of a problem. In testimony before Congress, the F.B.I. could not point to examples of national security investigations that were deterred by its lack of administrative subpoena power.\n        There could be a case that the F.B.I. should have this power in true emergencies, but that would require a very narrowly drawn provision that applied only in exigent circumstances. The Senate is considering something far more sweeping and dangerous: giving the F.B.I. an open-ended license to invade the privacy of ordinary Americans.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1738759,"ids":1738759,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The Patriot Act has been one of the few issues on which Congress has shown backbone lately. Last year, it refused to renew expiring parts of the act until greater civil liberties protections were added. But key members of the Senate have now caved, agreeing to renew these provisions in exchange for only minimal improvements. At a time when the public is growing increasingly concerned about the lawlessness of the Bush administration's domestic spying, the Senate should insist that any reauthorization agreement do more to protect Americans against improper secret searches.\n        When the Patriot Act was passed after Sept. 11, 2001, Congress made some of its most far-reaching provisions temporary so it would be able to reconsider them later on. Those provisions were set to expire last December, but Congress agreed to a very short extension so greater civil liberties protections could be added. This week, four key Republican senators -- later backed by two Democrats -- said that they had agreed to a deal with the White House. It is one that does little to protect Americans from government invasions of their privacy.\n        One of the most troubling aspects of the Patriot Act is the ''gag order'' imposed by Section 215, which prohibits anyone holding financial, medical and other private records of ordinary Americans from saying anything when the government issues a subpoena for those records. That means that a person whose records are being taken, and whose privacy is being invaded, has no way to know about the subpoena and no way to challenge it.\n        Rather than removing this gag order, the deal keeps it in place for a full year -- too long for Americans to wait to learn that the government is spying on them. Even after a year, someone holding such records would have to meet an exceedingly high standard to get the gag order lifted. It is not clear that this change has much value at all.\n        The compromise also fails to address another problem with Section 215: it lets the government go on fishing expeditions, spying on Americans with no connection to terrorism or foreign powers. The act should require the government, in order to get a subpoena, to show that there is a connection between the information it is seeking and a terrorist or a spy.\n        But the deal would allow subpoenas in instances when there are reasonable grounds for simply believing that information is relevant to a terrorism investigation. That is an extremely low bar.\n        One of the most well-publicized objections to the Patriot Act is the fact that it allows the government to issue national security letters, an extremely broad investigative tool, to libraries, forcing them to turn over their patrons' Internet records. The wording of the compromise is unclear. If it actually says that national security letters cannot be used to get Internet records from libraries, that would be an improvement, but it is not clear that it does.\n        In late December, it looked as if there was bipartisan interest in the Senate for changing the worst Patriot Act provisions and standing up for Americans' privacy rights. Now the hope of making the needed improvements has faded considerably.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1676761,"ids":1676761,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Patriot Act was passed in haste, in the angst-filled days after the Sept. 11 attacks, with some lawmakers candidly admitting they never read the details. That was one of the reasons key sections included expiration dates, so calmer heads of the future would have an opportunity to fix mistakes. Now that opportunity is here, and far from removing obvious threats to civil liberties in the law, the White House and eager Senate Republicans seem bent on making it worse.\n        Citizens who want to keep an eye on the process will have no easy task. The most crucial debates of the Senate Intelligence Committee are being kept closed to the public.\n        This is a terrible idea that gives credence to the worst fears of opponents of Patriot Act I. When the committee resumes its work next week, its leaders should rethink their policy and open their deliberations to the light of day. Accommodations can be made for legitimate security concerns without keeping such a bedrock issue under wraps.\n        One of the most common complaints about the Patriot Act is that rather than addressing the real but narrow problems with existing law, it was a wish list of powers law enforcement officials had yearned for over the years that Congress had rightly resisted conferring. Now the Bush administration and its Senate allies have come up with another: a proposal to let F.B.I. agents write their own ''administrative subpoenas,'' without the need to consult prosecutors or judges, in demand of all manner of records, from business to medical and tax data. There is no serious evidence that agents have been hamstrung by the lack of such wide authority.\n        Freeing agents from getting a judge's sign-off is an invitation to overreaching and abuse, as is a proposal to let the F.B.I. ignore postal law restraints when antiterrorism agents choose to monitor someone's letter envelopes and package covers.\n        Parts of the existing Patriot Act are reasonable law enforcement measures, but other sections should be repealed. Chief among these is the so-called library provision that lets the government seize entire databases at libraries, hospitals and other institutions when just one person is under investigation. Another part of the law makes it a crime for record holders to let the public know when a government data sweep has occurred.\n        Legitimate complaints that the existing law is overbearing have been heard from hundreds of state and local officials and from civil liberty and libertarian groups. Rather than addressing these flaws, Senate Republicans seem to be planning to compound them, under cover of closed hearings.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1782574,"ids":1782574,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, New Jersey Transit and the federal government are moving ahead with plans to build a new $7 billion rail tunnel under the Hudson. That is good for the co-dependent economies of the Garden State and New York City, neither of which can prosper without the other.\n        It is also good news for automobile addicts. Instead of sitting in traffic while trying to cross the Hudson River during rush hour, they will have a new reason to kick their increasingly expensive habit.\n        The new tunnel, which will complement the existing tunnel that links Penn Station to the American mainland, has been on the wish list of regional planners for years. The wish recently came much closer to reality when the Port Authority pledged $2 billion for the effort. New Jersey Transit and federal transportation agencies will pick up the rest of the tab.\n        Preliminary engineering work is about to begin, with 2016 the target date for completion.\n        The new tunnel will double rail capacity under the river, allowing New Jersey Transit to transport 86,000 daily rush-hour commuters by 2025, up from today's 43,000. It will also improve service along Amtrak's heavily used Northeast Corridor.\n        Commuters from the west, including some upstate New York counties, account for about 15 percent of the gross city product of New York City, according to the Regional Plan Association. And New Jersey owes a sizable portion of its prosperity to the availability of high-paying jobs in Manhattan.\n        It's alarming to consider, then, how much the region's 21st-century economy depends on early-20th-century planning and engineering. The current rail tunnel, which takes New Jersey commuters and Amtrak passengers into dreary Penn Station, is nearly a century old and holds just two tracks. It was built for a time when New Jersey really was a garden state, and when New York City's economy was far less reliant on guest workers from west of the Hudson.\n        Over the past decade, New Jersey Transit has vastly improved access to Penn Station. Its Midtown Direct service offers a direct link to Manhattan from Morris, Union, Somerset and Essex Counties. Its Frank R. Lautenberg Rail Station in Secaucus allows passengers from northern New Jersey and upstate New York to transfer to Penn Station-bound trains.\n        Partly as a result of this expansion, the existing rail tunnel cannot accommodate any more trains during rush hour. And, as regular commuters know well, a single mishap in the tunnel can lead to hours of delays and inconvenience.\n        The new tunnel would add two more tracks, one in each direction. Equally important, the plan calls for expansion of a century-old, two-track rail bridge over the Hackensack River near the tunnel. Without additional bridge capacity, the new tunnel may not be able to reach its potential.\n        The region's economy requires 21st-century improvements in its infrastructure. The new rail tunnel is an important step in that direction.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1794304,"ids":1794304,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The Roberts court officially began last year, but the term that starts this week should give the first clear picture of what kind of court it will be. The docket includes major cases involving abortion, affirmative action and the environment.\n        The justices in the Supreme Court's now solidly conservative majority will be given a chance to prove what sort of conservatives they intend to be: those who issue rulings to match their personal ideology, or those who want to keep the court on a steady path by respecting precedent.\n        The cases that have so far attracted the most attention are a pair of challenges to a federal law that criminalizes so-called partial birth abortions. The law, passed by Congress in 2003, does not have an exception for procedures necessary to protect the health of a pregnant woman. The court struck down a nearly identical ban in 2000 by the State of Nebraska. That ruling was 5 to 4, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor -- the court's perennial swing vote before she retired -- sided with the majority.\n        The ''partial birth'' cases should reveal a lot about the views of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito. If they are as hostile to abortion rights as many court watchers believe, there may now be five votes in favor of the ban, which could outlaw many second-trimester abortions and endanger the lives of women.\n        But if they are true to the statements they made at their confirmation hearings about respecting precedent, they should not want to reverse a decision the court made on this subject as recently as 2000.\n        The court has also agreed to hear a pair of challenges to admissions policies at K-12 public schools in Seattle and Louisville, Ky., that take race into account to promote diversity. These cases revisit many issues the court considered in 2003, when it upheld the University of Michigan's use of race in law school admissions. That was another 5-to-4 decision with Justice O'Connor casting the deciding vote. That ruling was right to say that schools should be able to take race into account, and the court should not change its stance now -- opening the door to even more challenges to affirmative action.\n        Among the other important cases the court will hear is one about global warming. A group of states and environmental organizations have sued the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to do its duty under the Clean Air Act to regulate new cars' emission of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. The court can and should prod the Bush administration to do more to protect the earth from the buildup of greenhouse gases, by requiring it to enforce the law that Congress passed.\n        If Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito turn out to be conservatives with a deep respect for precedent, the court is likely to remain fairly centrist. But the biggest factor is likely to be Justice Anthony Kennedy, who began last term to fill Justice O'Connor's role as a voice of moderation. We hope he continues to do so.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1645961,"ids":1645961,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Saw Mill River had a pretty bad 20th century, and the one before that wasn't so great, either. For long stretches it was an industrial septic system, polluted, diverted, paved over and forgotten. It rises near Chappaqua and trickles largely unseen under downtown Yonkers, then spills abashedly into the Hudson. The only thing keeping it from utter obscurity is its association with a parkway -- a memorial of dubious effectiveness, as Major Deegan might put it.\n        The many indignities suffered by the Saw Mill include being dissed by an untalented, though earnest, poet in 1891:\n        'Tis now, at Yonkers's spreading feet,\n        A flow with odorous sins replete;\n        Its nitid bosom has become\n        A snake-like yellow scrawl of scum.\n        Ouch! That must have hurt. (We looked up nitid. It means shining.)\n        We know the Saw Mill has had nothing to be nitid about for generations. But a couple of developments have come along that may get it back in the game, joining other once-manhandled rivers in doing what rivers are supposed to do, which is to nurture wildlife and wetlands, channel floodwaters and look pretty -- to sparkle and bubble and lift the hearts of humans lucky enough to live and work beside them.\n        The good news is the result of two accomplishments, one hard-nosed, the other dreamy.\n        Last week, the Westchester district attorney, Jeanine Pirro, announced a deal through which a local industrial polluter, American Sugar Refining, would pay $100,000 to the environmental watchdog Riverkeeper for spilling hydrochloric acid into the Hudson. The sum comes on top of a $20,000 fine the company paid after pleading guilty to criminal charges stemming from the 2003 spill. It is a resounding affirmation of a judicial principle we love: Make the polluter pay.\n        Riverkeeper plans to distribute the money to a local nonprofit, Groundwork Yonkers, for its Saw Mill River program. That initiative, the Saw Mill River Coalition, comprises more than 50 environmentalists, public officials, regular citizens and others trying to protect the river on multiple fronts. The bargain with American Sugar is a windfall for the coalition, which is working closely with Westchester County and the United States Army Corps of Engineers on a watershed management plan for the Saw Mill. It is a creative way to right an environmental wrong, and we applaud Ms. Pirro for it.\n        The second good moment came when Gov. George E. Pataki used his State of the State address to endorse a plan to uncover stretches of the Saw Mill River in Yonkers -- literally to lift the lid on the river, dismantling culverts and exposing its banks to daylight. The idea, a vision of the group Scenic Hudson, could be an aesthetic and economic windfall for downtown Yonkers, which is marred by large paved stretches as barren and dreary as its political culture.\n        Scenic Hudson has worked for years to develop parks and to fight sky-clogging high-rises in Yonkers and other communities up and down the river and its tributaries. A revitalized Yonkers downtown, with gracious walkways beside a restored Saw Mill River, would be a stunning addition to this record of achievement.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1839895,"ids":1839895,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Senate easily approved a bill this week that would free embryonic stem cell research from the worst shackles imposed by the Bush administration. The House passed its version earlier. A substantial majority of Americans tell pollsters they support embryonic stem cell research. Yet one man, President Bush, and a minority of his party, the religious and social conservatives, are once again trying to impose their moral code on the rest of the nation and stand in the way of scientific progress.\n        Mr. Bush is threatening a veto, and neither house had enough votes for the bills on initial passage to override him. Concerned voters will need to ratchet up the pressure on recalcitrant Republicans to help stop the president from killing the second enlightened stem cell bill in less than a year.\n        Under the president's current policy, federal funds can be used to support research on only some 20 stem cell lines that have limited scientific value. Many of the lines are deteriorating or contaminated, and the group as a whole lacks the diversity needed to conduct a wide range of studies. There is no doubt that progress is being hampered. The director of the National Institutes of Health, who had initially been a good soldier in trying to live within the president's policy, told the Senate last month that American science would be better served if the nation let researchers have access to more stem cell lines.\n        The restrictions on federal financing have led to absurdly complicated and costly maneuvers. Scientists are forced to buy extra equipment and laboratory space with private money to perform off-limits research while using equipment and supplies bought with federal money on the permitted stem cell research. In a shocking example cited during Senate debate, a California researcher who had been cultivating stem cells in a makeshift privately financed lab suffered a power failure but was unable to transfer her lines into industrial-strength freezers in another lab because they were federally financed. Two years of work melted away because of this inanity.\n        The Senate bill would greatly expand the available stem cell lines by tapping into the thousands of surplus embryos left over at fertility clinics. The bill would allow federal support for research on stem cell lines derived from embryos originally created for fertility treatments but not needed for that purpose and thus doomed to be discarded. The donors would have to give their informed consent and could not receive any financial or other inducements to donate their surplus embryos. In a nod to the religious conservatives, the bill also calls for research on alternative techniques to derive stem cells without the use of human embryos, an approach that is certainly worth pursuing but is deemed less promising by most experts.\n        At the same time, the Senate passed a bill proposed by supporters of the president's policy that seeks to derive stem cells from embryos that might be judged ''naturally dead,'' perhaps because they were considered unsuitable for transplantation at a fertility clinic. This is a poorly considered proposal that can only be deemed a diversion from the main business at hand -- the need to free American science from the chains imposed by the president.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1683429,"ids":1683429,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Senate has now completed work on an energy bill that might actually do some good. But that was not the only surprising news from the Senate floor last week: despite ferocious White House opposition, the Senate went on record as favoring a program of mandatory controls of emissions of the gases that contribute to global warming.\n        It did so in a ''sense of the Senate'' resolution whose nonbinding nature allowed opponents of aggressive action to dismiss it as meaningless.\n        The resolution was anything but meaningless. It represents a major turnaround in attitudes, especially among prominent Republicans who only a few years ago doubted a problem even existed. It is something to build on: Pete Domenici, the most influential Senate Republican on energy matters and a recent convert to the global warming cause, has already scheduled hearings to see what sort of legislation can be devised down the road.\n        And it terrifies the White House because it is further proof that the administration's efforts to minimize the warming threat have failed and that President Bush's voluntary approach to the problem is no longer taken seriously.\n        The energy bill itself is a mixed bag, though preferable to the dreadful collection of industry giveaways passed by the House. The Senate again rejected all efforts to require higher fuel efficiency for cars and trucks, even though that is the surest way to ease the country's dependence on foreign oil. Likewise, its ''clean coal'' provisions, while potentially useful, fall short of the effort required to develop a new generation of coal-fired plants capable of capturing the gases that help cause warming.\n        On balance, though, the measure is far more hospitable than recent energy bills to energy efficiency and renewable, nonpolluting fuels, especially in its tax provisions. Over White House objections, the bill includes a provision sponsored by Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico that would require that at least 10 percent of the country's electricity be generated by nonpolluting energy sources like wind power by 2020. And its provisions on renewable biofuels give promise of developing gasoline substitutes that go beyond the heavily subsidized corn-based ethanol so favored by farm-state senators.\n        It will be up to Mr. Domenici and Mr. Bingaman to make sure that these and other useful ideas survive a House-Senate conference.

Today's vote should get the support not only of Democrats, but of every Republican senator concerned about the American justice system.\n        The list of Mr. Gonzales's misdeeds is long and serious. The Justice Department has enormous power to put people in jail, destroy reputations and affect the outcomes of elections. It must enforce the law impartially, but Mr. Gonzales has allowed political partisanship to drive his department.\n        He appointed underqualified, ethically challenged ideologues, and let them run amok. Monica Goodling, a former top Gonzales aide, admitted that she crossed the line -- and most likely federal law -- by hiring lawyers for nonpolitical jobs based on their politics. The purge of nine United States attorneys last year was also clearly politically motivated. Talented, respected prosecutors were fired because they didn't do the Republican Party's bidding.\n        Mr. Gonzales's response has been shockingly deficient. He claimed that he was not in the loop on the firings. That would have been extreme dereliction of duty, since the fired attorneys were nearly 10 percent of his top state-level prosecutors. But it now seems clear that he was not telling the truth when he said it, which does not make him look any better.\n        The Justice Department is in shambles. Top officials have left under a cloud and have not been replaced. Morale is said to be terrible. And the department's credibility is shot.

The vote is a test, in particular, for Republican senators who call themselves independent -- like Arlen Specter, Norm Coleman, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe -- and who will have to choose between the president and the public interest.\n        James Comey, a respected former deputy attorney general, testified that if prosecutors have been hired based on politics under Mr. Gonzales, ''I don't know that there's any window you can go to to get the department's reputation back.''

When the arguments about procedures are over, the key question will remain: Has Mr. Bush put up men and women who deserve lifetime appointments to the federal bench? The three nominees who had hearings this month -- a mining and ranching industry flunky, a much-reversed judge with an antipathy for individual rights, and a lawyer with a bad habit of not following the rules for practicing law -- show why Democrats should stand firm.\n        There have been widespread calls for the White House to sit down with Senate Democrats and come up with a list of nominees who would be acceptable to both sides. The previous three administrations, of both Republican and Democratic presidents, at least tried to work toward consensus candidates. But the Bush administration has refused to negotiate. It has begun its second term on a particularly controversial note by resubmitting seven nominees who failed to win approval last year after Democratic filibusters. It has also sent back several other nominations on which the Senate did not act.\n        William Myers III, one of the seven filibustered nominees, has built a career as an anti-environmental extremist. He was a longtime lobbyist for the mining and cattle industries. Then, as the Interior Department's top lawyer, he put those industries' interests ahead of the public interest. In one controversial legal opinion, he overturned a decision that would have protected American Indian sacred sites, clearing the way for a company to do extensive mining in the area. Mr. Myers has been nominated for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco. That court plays a major role in determining the environmental law that applies to the Western states.\n        Terrence Boyle, who has been nominated for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, based in Richmond, is also a troubling choice. He has an extraordinarily high reversal rate for a district court judge. Many of his decisions that have been criticized by higher courts wrongly rejected claims involving civil rights, sex discrimination and disability rights.\n        Mr. Boyle's record is particularly troubling because the court reversing him, the Fourth Circuit, is perhaps the most hostile to civil rights in the federal appellate system, and even it has regularly found his rulings objectionable.\n        Thomas Griffith, who has been nominated for the powerful Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has the unfortunate distinction of having practiced law in two jurisdictions without the required licenses. While practicing law in Washington, D.C., he failed to renew his license for three years. Mr. Griffith blamed his law firm's staff for that omission, but the responsibility was his. When he later practiced law in Utah as general counsel at Brigham Young University, he never bothered to get a Utah license.\n        Mr. Myers, Mr. Boyle and Mr. Griffith were chosen for their archconservative political views, not their qualifications for the bench. No impartial person interested in choosing only the best possible judges would have put them at the top of the list.

More than 100 amendments are circling, many designed to make the tortuously drafted compromise meaner, narrower and nastier.\n        The coalition that struck the deal has so far stood firm against efforts to gut its more generous and sensible provisions. While there is so much to do to improve this flawed bill, the senators also must make sure it doesn't get worse. That means beating back a particularly noxious amendment from Senator John Cornyn of Texas.\n        Its ostensible purpose is to ''close a gaping loophole'' that Mr. Cornyn says would allow terrorists, gang members and sex offenders into the country. But his real target is bigger than that. He had no appetite for the bipartisan compromise and now wants to destroy it by attacking one of its pillars: a path to legal status for an estimated 12 million immigrants.\n        Mr. Cornyn would do this by significantly expanding the universe of offenses that make someone ineligible for legalization. Some people who used fake identity papers -- a huge portion of the undocumented population -- would be disqualified. The amendment would also expand the definition of ''aggravated felonies,'' an already overbroad category of crimes, to include the act of entering or re-entering the country illegally.\n        Even more perversely, the amendment applies retroactively. So people who crossed illegally years ago -- even those whose sentences have been suspended -- would be subject to the drastic consequences of being declared ''aggravated felons.'' They would face mandatory detention and deportation under already negligible protections of due process. Under the system Mr. Cornyn wants, someone who comes forward to immigration authorities in good faith and admits using a fake Social Security card could end up not on a path to earned legalization, but arrested and deported, depending on the whims of zealous prosecutors.\n        Those aren't the only parts of the amendment that could have been drafted by Kafka. A provision to keep out anyone who fails to show ''good moral character'' would give the attorney general broad discretion to bar any and all immigrants. That discretion would not be reviewable, secret evidence would be allowed, and an immigrant could see an application for naturalization denied and never know the reason.\n        This amendment is so far from the spirit of comprehensive reform that it amounts to legislative sabotage.

CAFE has saved billions of barrels of oil, but it has not been improved for decades. The bill before the Senate would bring fleetwide averages from roughly 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, hardly an impossible target. This proposal should be approved, and a weaker compromise offered by industry allies should be defeated.\n        Renewable Electricity.

The Senate approved a 10 percent requirement two years ago, and the House is talking about 20 percent.\n        Coal-to-Liquids. A coalition of coal interests has been lobbying furiously for subsidies to build a new generation of coal-to-liquid power plants to produce diesel fuel. This could reduce our dependence on foreign oil, although marginally and at great cost. It would also be a disaster in terms of global warming unless ways are found to capture and store the carbon dioxide emissions from the refining process. Without such safeguards, coal-to-liquid plants cannot be allowed to proceed.\n        Renewable Fuels. Biofuels offer a far cleaner and more promising approach to oil dependency than coal-to-liquids. The bill would quintuple production, chiefly ethanol from sources other than corn. This is a generally popular provision that must be amended to make sure that the rush to ethanol does not destroy valuable forest and conservation lands.\n        Waiting in the wings is a tax bill that will eventually be married to the energy bill. On the whole, the tax bill favors renewable and other clean energy sources over the oil, natural gas, coal and nuclear interests that received top billing in the 2005 plan. In fact, the entire energy discussion this year is more forward-looking than it has been for some time. It will be up to the leadership to keep it that way.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1659501,"ids":1659501,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Social Security trustees issued their annual report yesterday and said that by one measure, the shortfall in Social Security's finances jumped from $10.4 trillion last year to about $11 trillion this year. Eleven trillion dollars! The trustees, in service to President Bush's alarmist warnings about the need to do something drastic about Social Security, are dishing up some misleading numbers.\n        It's bad enough that the trustees began some of their calculations with that $10.4 trillion figure. It's arrived at by projecting the system's shortfall over infinity, rather than the usual 75-year time frame -- as if the system's finances 10,000 years from now are a legitimate policy concern. Moreover, no less an authority than the American Academy of Actuaries is already on record debunking infinite projections as conveying ''little if any useful information about the program's long-range finances'' and ''likely to mislead anyone lacking technical expertise  into believing that the program is in far worse financial condition than is actually indicated.''\n        Compounding the subterfuge is that the difference between this year's $11 trillion eyepopper and last year's number -- $600 billion -- is being used as evidence of a scary deterioration in Social Security's finances. That's just wrong. The two monster numbers are actually the same quantity -- different ways of expressing an unchanging level of debt at two different points in time. If you owe someone $1,000 in 10 years, for instance, you could retire the debt now with $500, or next year with $530. Your level of debt doesn't change, just the time point.\n        Some people who interpret the numbers as a deterioration appear to be confused. But others, like President Bush, are being deliberately alarmist. Mr. Bush's persistent misstatements on Social Security leave little doubt that he wants Americans to believe that the system is irretrievably broken so that they will buy into his unnecessary privatization plan.\n        Fortunately, the unpoliticized numbers in yesterday's report are not overly dire. Using a 75-year time horizon, the trustees project that the system will be able to pay full benefits until 2041, at which time it will be able to pay 74 percent of the promised benefits, falling to 68 percent by 2079. That works out to a gap of $4 trillion, which could be bridged with modest tax increases and benefit cuts, phased in over the next few decades. If people try to tell you different, they need to be set straight.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1832112,"ids":1832112,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Suffolk County Legislature would do its constituents a great service by decisively rejecting an anti-loitering bill now before it. The bill forbids people to obstruct vehicle or foot traffic on county roads. Its sponsors, Jack Eddington and Joseph Caracappa, portray it as an innocuous safety measure, but in fact it is a badly disguised effort to intimidate and harass Latino immigrants, specifically the day laborers whose presence in Farmingville has been a source of tension for years.\n        The concerns raised by Mr. Eddington and Mr. Caracappa are not baseless. Residents complain about contractors' trucks snarling traffic and men dashing in front of cars hoping to be picked up for a day's work. At a hearing last Tuesday, where more than a dozen speakers from unions and immigrant-advocacy organizations testified against the bill, Mr. Caracappa, as petulant a bully as you may ever see in a deliberative body, harangued speaker after speaker to agree with him on this point. Answer my question, he said, with the showboating hostility of a junior prosecutor: How would you feel if you lived in a community where hundreds of guys blocked traffic every day? He seemed frustrated that nobody gave the correct reply.\n        Here's the answer we think he was looking for: Yes, Mr. Caracappa, you are right. An out-of-control day-labor bazaar in a quiet suburb is a bad thing. It would make us angry, annoyed and alarmed.\n        But we would then expect our elected representatives to do something about it. And so we would say to you and Mr. Eddington: Is that it? Is that how you would subdue Suffolk's day-labor market, by ordering contractors and laborers to get off North Ocean Avenue and Horseblock Road? Is that the best you can do after Farmingville's festering decade -- pass a bill of dubious constitutionality, harass and criminalize day laborers, and, in a community sorely torn by ethnic and class tensions, energize the xenophobes who sit in the back at public hearings with their ''DEPORT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS'' signs, heckling the speakers and muttering to themselves?\n        Yes, we would be angry. Not at the day laborers, who are only trying to make a very poor living, but at lawmakers who could thoughtfully attack the problem but don't. The bill, in fact, dovetails neatly with the shameful anti-immigrant crusade of County Executive Steve Levy, who has gained national attention by thinking up ways to demonize illegal immigrants, and has warmly endorsed this one.\n        Some legislators at Tuesday's hearing tentatively brought up an idea discarded years ago: a hiring site to get the trucks and men off the streets. This would send the Legislature decisively in another direction, away from Mr. Levy's pet obsession and toward healing community wounds, isolating the xenophobic fringe and solving the Farmingville problem. The Legislature should consider it. But it should start by voting down the anti-loitering bill.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1705817,"ids":1705817,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The Supreme Court agreed this week to hear two cases testing the constitutionality of campaign finance laws, and one about whether Anna Nicole Smith, a former Playboy model, can collect millions from the estate of her nonagenarian Texas oil tycoon husband. We'd be happier if the court had stopped with Ms. Smith. The wrong decision in the other two cases would weaken campaign finance laws and increase the corrupting role of money in politics.\n        The big news at the court this week was the decision to hear a challenge to Vermont's campaign finance system. Vermont is the only state that has taken the laudable step of limiting not only contributions to campaigns, but candidates' spending as well. Spending limits for candidates are an important part of an effective campaign finance system. The absence of such limits gives an unfair advantage to wealthy candidates, who can spend vast amounts of their own money.\n        Vermont's law was a direct challenge to a 1976 Supreme Court decision called Buckley v. Valeo, which upheld limits on campaign contributions but struck down limits on candidates' expenditures. The Vermont law's supporters hope that the court will use the new case to rule that spending limits can be constitutional.\n        Such a ruling would be great, but that hope may be unduly optimistic. It is at least as likely that the current court will be tempted to use the Vermont case to make things worse.\n        Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas have been outspoken critics of campaign finance laws in many forms. They may try to push the court to revisit Buckley's other half -- the part upholding campaign contribution limits.\n        This case may be one of the first indications of what kind of chief justice John Roberts will be. At his confirmation hearings, he expressed his commitment to ''judicial modesty'' and his respect for established precedent. If he is true to those principles, deference to Vermont's Legislature and respect for Buckley should lead him to resist any entreaties by Justices Scalia and Thomas to dismantle the campaign finance law.\n        The court also agreed to hear a second campaign finance case. In it, a single-issue interest group in Wisconsin is challenging the McCain-Feingold law's limits on its ability to buy political ads in the weeks leading up to an election. The challenge is an attempt to create a loophole that would allow special-interest money to play a bigger, and corrupting, role in elections. A win for the special-interest group here would be a major loss for reform.\n        Ms. Smith's case, for all the publicity and late-night television jokes it has engendered, is a technical question involving her long-running battle with the son of J.Howard Marshall, the wealthy oilman she wed when she was 26 and he was 89. The court has agreed to hear arguments about whether judges in Texas or California should have the final say on the estate.\n        The case could mean more than $88 million for Ms. Smith or Mr. Marshall's other heirs, and it could resolve an obscure issue at the intersection of probate and bankruptcy law. But unlike the Vermont and Wisconsin cases, it poses no threat to the health of American democracy.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1801137,"ids":1801137,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The Supreme Court has been struggling to address the thorny question of when, if ever, punitive damages become so large that they violate the Constitution. The court made a good start when it laid down guidelines on when punitive damages are excessive. But eventually, it went too far. Today, it hears arguments in a case that offers a perfect opportunity to pull back to a more reasonable position.\n        The case involves Philip Morris's challenge to damages awarded to the widow of a smoker who died of lung cancer. An Oregon jury awarded Jesse Williams's widow, Mayola Williams, more than $821,000 in actual damages, and $79.5 million in punitive damages. Mrs. Williams said Philip Morris had engaged in 40 years of publicity to undercut concerns about cigarettes, even though it knew for most or all of that time that smoking was deadly.\n        The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the punitive damages award. The court said the conduct that Philip Morris was charged with ''would have kept many Oregonians smoking past the point when they would otherwise have quit.'' It said the company's ''deceit thus would, naturally and inevitably, lead to significant injury or death.''\n        The Supreme Court has already indicated that at some point punitive damages become so large that they violate due process. But it has done a poor job of identifying that point. Originally, it laid down some reasonable factors for lower courts to consider, including how reprehensible they considered the defendant's conduct. But in 2003, the court put forth the dubious proposition that punitive damages should generally be in a ''single digit'' ratio to actual damages -- so with actual damages of, say, $100,000, punitive damages should be under $1 million.\n        Constitutional principles can seldom be boiled down to a formula, and it is difficult to see why the court should rein in juries so tightly. The purpose of punitive damages is, the Supreme Court has noted, ''punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition.'' In cases of extremely bad conduct, particularly when a defendant is large and willful, a bigger award may be necessary. In this case, $79.5 million does not strike us as unreasonable. Nor do we see any basis for holding that this jury verdict, affirmed in a thoughtful decision by Oregon's highest court, is a denial of Philip Morris's due process rights.\n        A final problem with the Supreme Court's rule of thumb on punitive damages is that it has been far less restrictive when it comes to punishing people. In 2003, the court held that California did not violate the ban on cruel and unusual punishment when it sentenced a man under its three-strikes law to 50 years for a theft of $153.53 worth of videotapes. That is a far more disproportionate punishment than Philip Morris got, for far less offensive conduct.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1834326,"ids":1834326,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The Supreme Court heard arguments yesterday in a case that has attracted attention mainly because of its eccentric story line: An Alaska student was suspended from high school in 2002 after he unfurled a banner reading ''Bong Hits 4 Jesus'' while the Olympic torch passed by. But the case raises important issues of freedom of expression and student censorship that go far beyond the words on that banner. The court should affirm the appeals court's well-reasoned decision that when the school punished the student it violated his First Amendment rights.\n        Joseph Frederick and his fellow students were allowed to leave the grounds of Juneau-Douglas High School so they could watch the Olympic torch pass nearby. When the cameras began to roll, he unfurled his banner, which he says was meant to be funny and get him on television. The principal took it from him, and suspended him for 10 days.\n        Mr. Frederick says the suspension violated his rights. The school board insists the principal had the right to confiscate the banner and punish the student because the language undermined its teachings about the dangers of illegal drugs. The San Francisco-based United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled for Mr. Frederick, citing the 1969 case Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, which held that students have the right to free speech, which can be suppressed only when the speech disrupts school activities.\n        The Bush administration joined the school district in arguing that schools have broad authority to limit talk about drugs because of the importance of keeping drugs away from young people. But if schools can limit speech on any subject deemed to be important, students could soon be punished for talking about the war on terror or the war in Iraq because the government also considers those subjects important.\n        Some school administrators would no doubt use their power to clamp down on conservative speech while others would clamp down on liberal speech. A school that values diversity could punish students who criticize affirmative action, while a more conservative school could ban students from taking outspoken positions about global warming. Religious groups have joined civil libertarians in backing Mr. Frederick because they fear schools will punish students who talk about their religious beliefs.\n        If the Supreme Court wants to dodge the free-speech-in-school issues, it could rule that the off-campus Olympic torch event was not a formal school activity -- and that the principal had no right to limit anyone's free speech there. That would not harm students' free speech rights, but it would also do little to affirm them.\n        The court should go further, and rule that Mr. Frederick's rights were infringed. Students do not have the right to interfere substantially with school activities, but Mr. Frederick did not do that. The court should use this case to reaffirm Tinker's famous pronouncement that students do not shed their right to free speech ''at the schoolhouse gate.''","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1829484,"ids":1829484,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Supreme Court hears arguments today in a case that could have a broad impact on whether the courthouse door remains open to ordinary Americans who believe that the government is undermining the separation of church and state.\n        The question before the court is whether a group seeking to preserve the separation of church and state can mount a First Amendment challenge to the Bush administration's ''faith based'' initiatives. The arguments turn on a technical question of whether taxpayers have standing, or the right to initiate this kind of suit, but the real-world implications are serious. If the court rules that the group does not have standing, it will be much harder to stop government from giving unconstitutional aid to religion.\n        Soon after taking office, President Bush established the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, and faith-based offices in departments like Justice and Education. They were intended to increase the federal grant money going to religious organizations, and they seem to have been highly effective. The plaintiffs cited figures showing that from 2003 to 2005, the number of federal grants to religious groups increased 38 percent. The Freedom From Religion Foundation and several of its members sued. They say that because the faith-based initiatives favor religious applicants for grants over secular applicants, they violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits government support for religion.\n        These are profound issues, but because the administration challenged the right of the foundation and its members to sue, the courts must decide whether the plaintiffs have the right to sue in this case before they can consider the constitutionality of the faith-based programs. An appeals court has ruled, correctly, that the plaintiffs have standing.\n        In many cases, taxpayers are not in fact allowed to sue to challenge government actions, but the Supreme Court has long held that they have standing to allege violations of the Establishment Clause. Without this sort of broad standing, many entanglements between church and state would never make it to court.\n        The Bush administration is pushing an incorrect view of standing as it tries to stop the courts from reaching the First Amendment issue. Taxpayers can challenge the financing of religious activity, the administration claims, only when a Congressional statute expressly authorizes the spending. There is no statute behind the faith-based initiative.\n        In his decision for the appeals court, Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, convincingly explained why this argument is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's precedents on the Establishment Clause.\n        Procedural issues like standing can have an enormous impact on the administration of justice if they close the courthouse door on people with valid legal claims. The Supreme Court has made it clear that taxpayers may challenge government assistance to religion. The justices should affirm Judge Posner's ruling so the courts can move on to the important question: Do the Bush administration's faith-based policies violate the Constitution?","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1683506,"ids":1683506,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The Supreme Court reached opposite results yesterday in a pair of cases involving the Ten Commandments, upholding a display of the commandments on the grounds of the Texas Capitol, while striking down displays in Kentucky courthouses. The rulings will be criticized from all sides; we would have preferred the Texas case to have come out the other way. But taken together, they are an important reaffirmation of the nation's commitment to separation of church and state.\n        Displays of the Ten Commandments have become a flashpoint in the religious right's campaign to inject more Christianity into public life. Roy Moore, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, was removed from office after defying a court order to remove a two-and-a-half-ton granite Ten Commandments monument from his courthouse. There have been similar legal skirmishes in other states, including the two that the court ruled on yesterday.\n        The legal case against the displays is straightforward. The Ten Commandments are religious scripture taken directly from the Bible. The First Amendment requires the government to be neutral about religion, and putting the Ten Commandments on government property violates that principle. Installing them in a courthouse is especially disturbing, because it sends a message that the legal system will favor the tenets, and perhaps the adherents, of a particular religious tradition.\n        In the Kentucky case, which involved two counties that posted the Ten Commandments on courthouse walls, the Supreme Court strongly reaffirmed its commitment to government neutrality toward religion. It rejected the argument that the counties had a secular purpose for the displays. They were promoting religion, the court held, and violating the Constitution by doing so.\n        The Texas case involved a more subtle display -- the Ten Commandments were one of 17 monuments and 21 historical markers on 22 acres around the Capitol. Justice Stephen Breyer, who disapproved of the Kentucky displays, switched sides in this instance, saying the Texas installation was a borderline case. The Ten Commandments have a religious message, he argued, but it was offset in Texas by the other displays, all purporting to embody the ideals of Texas' settlers. Taken together, he said, it suggested an overall secular purpose. That is a stretch. Having the Ten Commandments on the Capitol grounds, but not the holy writings of other faiths, sends a clear message, as Justice John Paul Stevens notes in dissent, that ''this state endorses the divine code of the 'Judeo-Christian' God.''\n        Justice Breyer's real motivation may have been pragmatic. If the Texas display is unconstitutional, so are many similar displays nationwide. Ordering them all removed, he wrote, could ''create the very kind of religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid.''\n        With the religious right clamoring for more religious iconography in public spaces, it is understandable that the court might have shied away from a dramatic ruling that would have heightened what is already a strong antagonism toward the judiciary among some conservative groups. Ceding some ground on Ten Commandments displays may seem like a way to keep the peace. But as our country becomes more religiously diverse, putting one faith in a privileged position is likely to create more religious strife, not less. As with so much else, the founders, who came up with the idea of a clear wall of separation between church and state, had it right.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1641834,"ids":1641834,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Supreme Court sent a jolt through the criminal justice system this week by ruling that judges are not required to follow the federal sentencing guidelines. The ruling, which makes the guidelines merely advisory, strikes a judicious balance between two conflicting interests: the goal of making sentences for similar crimes equivalent, and the desire to allow judges flexibility to take into account the circumstances of particular crimes and criminals.\n        There is already talk in Congress about trying to undo the Supreme Court's decision. That would be a serious mistake.\n        Congress passed the sentencing guidelines in the mid-1980's, with bipartisan support, in an attempt to make criminal sentences in federal cases more uniform. While the guidelines have been praised for doing just that, they have also been criticized for contributing to the nation's prison overpopulation. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is hardly a liberal on criminal justice issues, told the American Bar Association in 2003 that the sentencing guidelines were too harsh and inflexible. Some trial judges have complained that the guidelines have unduly tied their hands, compelling them to impose sentences that they believe did not fit the crimes before them.\n        The guidelines became legally vulnerable last June when the Supreme Court struck down Washington State's sentencing guidelines. The court ruled that they violated the Sixth Amendment because they required judges to take factors into account in sentencing, like the harm caused by the crime, that were never submitted to a jury. Not unexpectedly, the court has now extended the logic of that decision to the federal guidelines.\n        What is most notable about this week's decision is that, rather than tossing out the federal guidelines completely, the court ruled that judges must still ''consult'' them in making sentencing decisions. To ensure that this is not an empty formality, appeals courts will then review the sentencing decisions -- and the use of the guidelines -- for ''reasonableness.'' It remains to be seen how this will work in practice, but the general idea of trying to impose uniformity but not rigidity is a good one.\n        In recent years, conservatives in Congress have complained about judges' failing to follow the guidelines, and Congress has taken steps to monitor individual judges' sentencing practices. One leader of that effort criticized this week's ruling as an ''egregious overreach.'' Rather than racing to try to limit or reverse the decision, its opponents should wait to see how it works in practice. Otherwise, Congress could rush through ill-considered legislation that once again unduly tied judges' hands.\n        If the new procedures outlined by the court turn out to undermine substantially the goals of the sentencing guidelines and make federal punishments widely disparate and unfair, there will always be time later for Congress to consider enacting new legislation. For now, everyone should step back and give federal trial judges -- as they consult the sentencing guidelines and are reviewed by appellate courts -- a chance to show that they can exercise their discretion wisely.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1851071,"ids":1851071,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Supreme Court struck a blow for discrimination this week by stripping a key civil rights law of much of its potency. The majority opinion, by Justice Samuel Alito, forced an unreasonable reading on the law, and tossed aside longstanding precedents to rule in favor of an Alabama employer that had underpaid a female employee for years. The ruling is the latest indication that a court that once proudly stood up for the disadvantaged is increasingly protective of the powerful.\n        Lilly Ledbetter, a supervisor at the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company in Gadsden, Ala., sued her employer for paying her less than its male supervisors. At first, her salary was in line with the men's, but she got smaller raises, which created a significant pay gap. Late in her career, Ms. Ledbetter filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. A jury found that Goodyear violated her rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n        Goodyear argued that she filed her complaint too late and, by a 5-4 margin, the Supreme Court agreed. Title VII requires employees to file within 180 days of ''the alleged unlawful employment practice.'' The court calculated the deadline from the day Ms. Ledbetter received her last discriminatory raise. Bizarrely, the majority insisted it did not matter that Goodyear was still paying her far less than her male counterparts when she filed her complaint.\n        In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that there were strong precedents supporting Ms. Ledbetter. The Supreme Court ruled in a similar race discrimination case that each paycheck calculated on the basis of past discrimination is unlawful under Title VII. The courts of appeals have overwhelmingly agreed. So did the E.E.O.C., the agency charged with enforcing Title VII.\n        In addition to interpreting the statute unreasonably and ignoring the relevant precedents, the majority blinded itself to the realities of the workplace. Employees generally do not know enough about what their co-workers earn, or how pay decisions are made, to file a complaint precisely when discrimination occurs. At Goodyear, as at many companies, salaries were confidential. The court's new rules will make it extraordinarily difficult for victims of pay discrimination to sue under Title VII. That is not how Congress intended the law to be enforced, merely how five justices would like it to be.\n        It is disturbing that Anthony Kennedy, the court's swing justice, cast the deciding vote in favor of gutting a key part of the Civil Rights Act.

It should do so without delay.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1661403,"ids":1661403,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Supreme Court struck an important blow for older workers this week by making it easier for them to sue for age discrimination. The ruling, which allows older workers to use the same kind of proof as victims of race or sex discrimination, corrects numerous bad rulings by lower courts. Now that the law has changed for the better, employers should be far more careful about how they treat older workers.\n        The Age Discrimination in Employment Act bars discrimination against workers over the age of 40. But courts have blunted the law's impact by interpreting it in an unduly narrow way. When women, blacks and members of other groups sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, they do not need to prove intentional discrimination. They can show ''disparate impact,'' which means that their group was disproportionately harmed by an employer's policy or behavior. Even though the age law has nearly identical language, many courts have refused to allow older workers to bring disparate-impact claims.\n        This misreading of the statute was part of a larger, and shameful, hostility by the courts to suits by older workers. In case after case, judges have refused to recognize intentional discrimination, which was illegal even before this week's ruling, despite clear evidence. In one notable instance, a 56-year-old worker was fired by a North Carolina company two weeks after a supervisor told him, ''O'Connor, you are too damn old for this kind of work.'' A federal appeals court ruled that the worker had not proved his case.\n        The Supreme Court has now given older workers the protection Congress intended by allowing them to sue based on disparate impact. This week's ruling still leaves employers a significant way out because it allows them to prevail if they can show that they acted based on ''reasonable factors other than age.'' But wise in-house lawyers will be warning their companies in the days ahead to re-evaluate their treatment of older workers in things like promotions and layoffs.\n        Workers over the age of 40, who are nearly half of the work force, deserve to be treated fairly. But they are not the only ones who are likely to benefit. Older people are often the most competent and conscientious workers, but employers may be too ignorant or biased to realize it. As the United States is thrust into an ever more competitive global economy, it cannot afford to let prejudice prevent it from having the best possible work force.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1803824,"ids":1803824,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The Supreme Court unnecessarily returned to the politically charged area of abortion this week, hearing arguments in a case testing some of the core principles of Roe v. Wade and the court's own credibility as an institution removed from politics.\n        At issue, once again, is a deceptively broad ban on so-called partial-birth abortions. The court struck down a similar measure just six years ago, but since then two new justices have arrived. In the interest of women's privacy and health -- and in defense of the court's own reputation -- the justices should strike down this far-reaching assault on reproductive freedom.\n        In 2000, the court struck down a nearly identical Nebraska law for essentially two reasons. It found that the law's imprecise language applied not just to a single late-term abortion method -- as the ban's supporters claimed -- but would criminalize other common abortion procedures that are constitutionally protected. The court also ruled that the law was unconstitutional because it provided no exception to protect a woman's health.\n        In a cynical move in 2003, Congress passed a law remarkably similar to the one the court had just struck down -- with a definition of the procedures it was outlawing about as sweeping as Nebraska's. Defying the Supreme Court, moreover, Congress refused to include an exception for protecting the health of the woman. Instead, it simply made the medically inaccurate assertion that the ill-defined procedure it outlawed was never necessary to preserve a woman's health. Every lower federal court that has considered the Congressional ban has held it to be unconstitutional.\n        If Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who cast the deciding vote in 2000, had not retired, it is highly unlikely the court would have agreed to entertain this rerun. But without her, it is not clear that there are still five votes to defeat this assault on Roe , or to uphold the bedrock requirement that abortion restrictions have an exception for protecting a woman's health.\n        It seems unlikely that Chief Justice John Roberts or Justice Samuel Alito will provide the fifth vote. That means that Justice Anthony Kennedy, the current swing justice, is likely to decide this case. In 2000, Justice Kennedy joined those who would have upheld the Nebraska law. But at oral argument his questions suggested that he may take issue with Congress's assertion that the ban would not put women's health at risk -- an encouraging sign.\n        Even justices who oppose abortion rights need to be concerned about that. They also need to worry about how the court will look if the recent change in its membership produces a starkly different result on an issue so vital to women's privacy and health.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1827751,"ids":1827751,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Supreme Court's decision yesterday overturning a nearly $80 million punitive damage award against Philip Morris is a win for corporate wrongdoers. It stretches the Constitution's guarantee of due process in a way that will make it easier for companies that act reprehensibly to sidestep serious punishments.\n        It also provides unsettling new evidence that the court is more concerned about -- and more willing to protect -- the powerful than the powerless.\n        An Oregon jury awarded Mayola Williams, the widow of a cigarette smoker, about $821,000 in compensatory damages and $79.5 million in punitive damages. Ms. Williams argued that Philip Morris had spent 40 years denying the connection between smoking and cancer, even though it knew cigarettes were deadly. The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the punitive damages award, saying that Philip Morris's actions had been ''extraordinarily reprehensible.'' By keeping Oregonians smoking longer than they otherwise would have, the court said, the company's actions would, ''naturally and inevitably, lead to significant injury or death.''\n        By a 5-to-4 vote that did not follow the usual ideological lines, the court ruled that the award was improper because it punished Philip Morris for harm done to people who were not part of the lawsuit. There is nothing unusual, or wrong, about courts' considering the broader impact of a wrongdoer's misdeeds. As Justice John Paul Stevens noted in dissent, ''A murderer who kills his victim by throwing a bomb that injures dozens of bystanders should be punished more severely than one who harms no one other than his intended victim.'' The fact that Philip Morris hurt so many other smokers along with Jesse Williams is surely relevant to its punishment.\n        The court in recent years has become increasingly activist when it comes to defending the rights of corporations by striking down punitive damage awards. And yesterday's ruling continues that trend. It expands the notion of due process. And it overturns the decisions of a jury and a state supreme court.\n        Unfortunately, the court has been far less activist when ordinary people seek protection or challenge their punishments. The ruling stands in particular contrast with the court's 2003 decision that the Eighth Amendment's ban on ''cruel and unusual punishments'' did not bar California, under its ''three strikes'' law, from sentencing a man to 50 years in prison for stealing $153.53 worth of videotapes. Yesterday's decision is another disturbing sign that -- as the current court reads the Constitution -- powerful parties have more rights than regular people.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1682597,"ids":1682597,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The Supreme Court's ruling yesterday that the economically troubled city of New London, Conn., can use its power of eminent domain to spur development was a welcome vindication of cities' ability to act in the public interest. It also is a setback to the ''property rights'' movement, which is trying to block government from imposing reasonable zoning and environmental regulations. Still, the dissenters provided a useful reminder that eminent domain must not be used for purely private gain.\n        The city of New London has fallen on hard times. In 1998 -- when its population was at its lowest since 1920, and its unemployment rate was nearly twice the state average -- an effort was begun to turn New London around. State and local officials put together a redevelopment plan, anchored by a $300 million Pfizer research center, that would bring restaurants, stores and a new Coast Guard museum to one hard-hit neighborhood.\n        The city authorized a nonprofit development corporation to clear the necessary land by eminent domain, a forced sale in which the seller is given appropriate compensation. The development corporation got control of most of the land it needed, but a few people refused to sell.\n        Eminent domain allows governments to take property for a public use, such as building a road. The property owners in New London claimed that handing over private property to a private developer cannot be a public use, even if it is part of a comprehensive plan to turn around a depressed city.\n        The Supreme Court, by a 5-to-4 vote, sided with the city. The court noted that in past cases it had taken a broad view on this issue, and given governments wide discretion to determine when a taking of property meets this standard. New London, the court held, was within its rights to decide that its development plan was a valid public use. (The New York Times benefited from eminent domain in clearing the land for the new building it is constructing opposite the Port Authority Bus Terminal.)\n        In a blistering dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor lamented that the decision meant that the government could transfer any private property from the owner to another person with more political influence ''so long as it might be upgraded.'' That is a serious concern, but her fears are exaggerated. The majority strongly suggested that eminent domain should be part of a comprehensive plan, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing separately, underscored that its goal cannot simply be to help a developer or other private party become richer.\n        That is not the situation in New London. Connecticut is a rich state with poor cities, which must do everything they can to attract business and industry. New London's development plan may hurt a few small property owners, who will, in any case, be fully compensated. But many more residents are likely to benefit if the city can shore up its tax base and attract badly needed jobs.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1794306,"ids":1794306,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson Jr., capped off his recent trip to China with a visit last week to Capitol Hill. His aim was to dissuade Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, from moving forward on their bill to impose punitive tariffs on China. The two senators accuse China of manipulating its currency, the yuan, to gain an unfair trade advantage.\n        Mr. Paulson was right to try to parry the senators' protectionist efforts, and he has succeeded, for now. But the issue will persist so long as he fails to satisfactorily address a root cause of mounting protectionist pressures: the United States' growing indebtedness to the rest of the world.\n        Instead, Mr. Paulson recently told reporters that the nation's deficit in trade and other international transactions -- on track this year to reach $800 billion, or nearly 7 percent of the economy -- is actually a sign of strength. America has kept the world prosperous, he said, by buying global goods.\n        Come again? America's borrow-and-spend ways have indeed juiced the global economy. But the resulting indebtedness makes the country vulnerable to the protectionism Mr. Paulson wants to avoid, as well as to broader economic disarray.\n        Many American businesses -- and politicians -- see the mounting trade deficit and immediately cry foul. Demands for tariffs are the predictable, if misguided, reaction. Protectionism conveniently shifts the blame for trade-related hardships to foreigners, which is easier than adapting homegrown business practices to make America more competitive.\n        There are other dangers. If lenders like China began to doubt the strength of the American economy, they could put their money elsewhere, driving up American interest rates, perhaps sharply.\n        To reduce excessive foreign borrowing, it is imperative to reduce the federal deficit. To that end, Mr. Paulson has pledged to help the Bush administration find ways to curb Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. That would certainly cut the budget, but at the cost of weakening the already frayed safety net -- at precisely the time when increasing globalization is creating economic hardship for many Americans. It would be far better to start a deficit reduction effort by calling for a moratorium on further tax cuts and allowing other Bush-era tax cuts to expire as scheduled.\n        That, along with continuing efforts to adjust exchange rates in China and other countries, would lower the risks the United States is now courting.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1832258,"ids":1832258,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The United States Supreme Court has added to its docket for next term an appeal of recent lower court decisions invalidating New York's clubhouse-controlled judicial election system.

The No Child Left Behind Act requires the states to end this practice. But the states are unlikely to truly improve teacher quality -- or spread qualified teachers more equitably throughout the schools -- until they pay more attention to how teachers are trained, hired, evaluated and assigned.\n        To get control of the assignment process, districts will need to abandon union rules that basically guarantee senior teachers the right to change schools whenever they want -- even if the principal of the receiving school does not want them -- by bumping a less senior teacher out of his or her job.\n        Obviously, not every teacher who moves to a new school is a bad egg. But principals who wish to shed ineffective teachers often induce them to transfer by threatening negative evaluations, turning the transferring teacher into the receiving school's problem. A study by a nonpartisan New York research group, the New Teacher Project, found that the transfer dance goes on well into the summer, creating a logistical train wreck in staffing. Unable to determine their hiring needs in a timely fashion, school administrators delay making decisions -- thus losing better-qualified applicants who grow frustrated and take jobs elsewhere.\n        Talented novices, with no seniority rights to protect them, often quit the field after being shunted from one place to another. Others give up on the urban school systems where the bumping process is most prevalent and high-tail it to the suburbs. Meanwhile, back in the city, schools are still cobbling together their staffs after the school year has begun. The revolving door turns, instructional time is lost and children suffer.\n        States and localities are beginning to recognize the problems with this system. New York City, for example, eliminated the forced transfer right in contract negotiations. In California, the State Legislature has passed a law giving principals at low-performing schools the power to veto forced transfers. The law also requires that seniority-based transfers be completed for all schools by April 15 for the following school year.\n        Urban systems all over the country need to move toward reform. A senior teacher who has been forced out elsewhere or who simply wishes to move elsewhere should be guaranteed an interview at the preferred school, but not a job.

The correctional system's price tag is more than $60 billion -- up from just $9 billion two decades ago -- and states are understandably eager to shave costs. Some are attempting to do it by cutting back on already dismal prison medical care.\n        Prison inmates are literally the sickest people in our society. States and municipalities frequently try to dodge the bill for treating them by ordering up bids from private providers and signing up with the cheapest, most bare-bones plan. Paul von Zielbauer of The Times recently opened a window onto this aspect of the problem with a harrowing series of articles about Prison Health Services, the nation's largest private provider of jail and prison medical care, handling about one in every 10 people who live behind bars in this country.\n        Among the horrific deaths described in the series is that of Brian Tetrault, a 44-year-old man with Parkinson's disease who died after an upstate New York jail's medical director drastically cut his medicine. Officials then falsified records to make it appear that Mr. Tetrault had been released before he died. Another upstate inmate, 35-year-old Victoria Williams Smith, died of a heart attack after being mocked by a prison nurse and denied treatment for days. Equally as troubling were accounts of how Prison Health Services failed to keep a close eye on inmates who later committed suicide, and its habit of sometimes employing doctors with criminal records and doctors who lacked state certification.\n        Shoddy care and the denial of care are unfortunately not unique to private companies, which do not provide the majority of the health care that is supplied to inmates. Many publicly run systems, which provide most of the care for the nation's inmates, are equally bad. The root problem is that the country has tacitly decided to starve the prison system of medical care, even though AIDS, tuberculosis and hepatitis are rampant behind bars, and roughly one in six inmates suffers from a serious mental illness.\n        The corrections system is largely cut off from the public health system, in part because of federal rules that deny Medicaid assistance to inmates. The denial of benefits is based on the notion that people who break the law don't deserve public help, a theory that has helped spread tuberculosis, AIDS and hepatitis from prisons to the world outside. Privatization of services is no magic cure for this growing threat to public health. The common-sense response would be a coherent, publicly subsidized program of testing, counseling and treatment that would slow the spread of disease, both behind bars and after inmates were released.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1660707,"ids":1660707,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The United States has far better ways to reward Pakistan for its helpful but selective pressure on Al Qaeda and the Taliban than President Bush's decision last week to break with 15 years of policy and sell Pakistan high-performance fighters whose only plausible use is to threaten India. Balancing those sales by offering New Delhi the chance to purchase, and perhaps build, similar planes doesn't lessen the damage of the Pakistan sale. It compounds it. The worst thing for these two nuclear powers, which have fought three wars against each other since 1947, is to encourage them to engage in a new, American-fueled arms race.\n        The United States does have a compelling strategic interest in helping Pakistan. But the right kind of help does not consist of selling Pakistan's armed forces, led by the country's military dictator, President Pervez Musharraf, prestigious, expensive and dangerous weapons systems. Decades of swollen military budgets have virtually bankrupted Pakistan, leaving its government unable to afford adequate spending on education and job-creating economic modernization. Instead, its leaders have fed the Pakistani people a diet of belligerent nationalism and projects like nuclear weapons that are designed to enhance a sense of prestige.\n        In this environment, civilian democracy has never struck deep roots, military takeovers have been common, and recruitment for a variety of groups preaching armed Islamist jihad has thrived. General Musharraf likes to advertise his occasional attacks on the most terrifying symptoms of this syndrome. He is far less willing to strike at its sources by pushing Pakistan toward development and democracy and far too eager to drain its resources on supersonic attack jets.\n        In reviewing the new Pakistan arms sale policy, which overturns a 15-year-old ban imposed over concerns about Pakistani nuclear weapons activity, Congress should think hard about the messages the United States wants to send to future proliferators. Pakistan developed nuclear weapons of its own after refusing to sign international nonproliferation treaties. Worse, it has spread nuclear weapons technology to Iran, North Korea, Libya and who knows what other countries, through the rogue network that was run by its top government nuclear scientist, A.Q. Khan. When Dr. Khan's activities became public a little over a year ago, he was pardoned by Pakistan's government, which conveniently avoided embarrassing revelations about any help he might have received from allies in the Pakistani military.\n        Advocates of these military sales will argue, as they always do, that if the United States did not sell Pakistan and India advanced fighter jets, other countries would. That is probably true, but it is not a justification for fueling an arms race. One big reason both governments want to buy American planes is to advertise to their own people and the world that their costly military spending enjoys the full backing of Washington.

After a tenfold increase in the nation's prison population -- and a corrections price tag that exceeds $60 billion a year -- the states have often been forced to choose between building new prisons or new schools. Worse still, the country has created a growing felon caste, now more than 16 million strong, of felons and ex-felons, who are often driven back to prison by policies that make it impossible for them to find jobs, housing or education.\n        Congress could begin to address this problem by passing the Second Chance Act, which would offer support services for people who are leaving prison. But it would take more than one new law to undo 30 years of damage:\n        Researchers have shown that inmates who earn college degrees tend to find jobs and stay out of jail once released. Congress needs to revoke laws that bar inmates from receiving Pell grants and that bar some students with drug convictions from getting other support. Following Washington's lead, the states have destroyed prison education programs that had long since proved their worth.\n        People who leave prison without jobs or places to live are unlikely to stay out of jail. Congress should repeal the lifetime ban on providing temporary welfare benefits to people with felony drug convictions. The federal government should strengthen tax credit and bonding programs that encourage employers to hire people with criminal records.

That means abandoning the mandatory sentencing laws that have filled prisons to bursting with nonviolent offenders who are doomed to remain trapped at the very margins of society.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1764594,"ids":1764594,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The United States spent most of its history enjoying the fruits of the theory that the only professions suitable for respectable women were nursing and teaching. As a result, the schools and hospitals were filled with highly qualified people working for extremely low wages. Then women's liberation arrived, and with it, a drastic shortage of teachers and nurses.\n        The medical needs of an aging population make the nursing situation seem particularly stark. With the coming retirement of the last generation of women who chose nursing simply because they didn't want to teach, things are likely to get only worse. The average age of registered nurses now is estimated at 47 and climbing.\n        As Celia Dugger reported last week in The Times, American hospitals are looking overseas to solve some of the current nursing shortage, eliciting worried responses from African and Asian countries that worry about losing their own desperately needed medical professionals. In the Philippines, most of the government doctors have enrolled in nursing training in hopes of being permitted to come to the United States to work.\n        The idea of the richest country in the world skimming the scant cream off the health care staffs of poor countries is disturbing. No one wants to close the gates to a skilled population of people. This page, which has argued that unskilled illegal immigrants should be given a path to potential citizenship, is not going to say that nurses from the Philippines should receive less favored treatment. But it is incumbent on the United States to start trying to solve this problem on its own.\n        One of the first and most obvious fixes is increased government spending on nursing education -- particularly the training of professors of nursing. The Nurse Education Loan Repayment Program, which provides financial aid to students who agree to work after graduation in places that have a critical shortage of nurses, was able to pay for fewer than 20 percent of the applicants in 2005. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing reported that more than 30,000 qualified students were not admitted last year because of a lack of space and faculty.\n        Although salaries have been rising, nursing groups say that one of the chief complaints of their members is low pay. But like doctors and other medical practitioners, they also report dropping job satisfaction because of the pressures of modern cost-driven medical care. Their dissatisfactions mirror those of today's patients: too few medical workers serving too many very sick people. And none of those things are going to be solved on the cheap.\n        Back in the 19th century, the reformer and physician William Alcott envisioned an early version of a national health system. He proposed that as many women as possible should be trained as nurses so all Americans could benefit from free medical care. The idea that the nurses would want to be paid did not seem to occur to Alcott. Even today, the country does not seem to have quite adjusted to the idea.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1829263,"ids":1829263,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The United States was not the only country to respond to the horror of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks with policies that went much too far in curtailing basic rights and civil liberties in the name of public safety. Now we see that a nation can regain its senses after calm reflection and begin to rein back such excesses, but that heartening news comes from Canada and not the United States.\n        Canada's Supreme Court has struck down a law that the government used to detain foreign-born terrorism suspects indefinitely -- employing secret evidence and not filing charges -- while orders to deport them were reviewed. The law was actually passed in 1978, but was primarily employed to detain and deport foreign spies. After the 2001 attacks, the Canadian government began using it aggressively to hold terrorism suspects, claiming that it was an important tool for keeping Canada safe.\n        That is just the sort of argument the Bush administration used to ram the excesses of the Patriot Act and the 2006 Military Commissions Act through Congress, and offered as an excuse for other abusive policies, like President Bush's illegal wiretapping of international calls and e-mail.\n        The Canadian justices rejected their government's specious national security claim with a forceful 9-to-0 ruling that upheld every person's right to fair treatment. ''The overarching principle of fundamental justice that applies here is this: before the state can detain people for significant periods of time, it must accord them a fair judicial process,'' Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin wrote.\n        The contrast with the United States could not be more disturbing. The Canadian court ruling came just days after a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that Congress could deny inmates of the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention camp the ancient right to challenge their confinement in court. The 2006 military tribunals law revoked that right for a select group who had been designated ''illegal enemy combatants'' without a semblance of judicial process.\n        In late January, Canada created another unflattering contrast with United States policy when it offered a formal apology and financial compensation to Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen who was a victim of Mr. Bush's decision to approve open-ended detentions, summary deportations and even torture after 9\/11. Mr. Arar was detained in the United States and deported to Syria, where he was held for nearly a year and tortured.\n        Instead of apologizing to Mr. Arar, who was cleared of any connection to terrorism by a Canadian investigatory panel, Justice Department lawyers are fighting a lawsuit he has brought in this country, using their usual flimsy claim of state secrets. The Bush administration still refuses to remove Mr. Arar from its terrorist watch list.\n        The United States Supreme Court has ruled twice in favor of Guant\u00e1namo detainees on statutory grounds, but it has yet to address the profound constitutional issues presented by American practices, including the abuses Congress authorized when it passed the Military Commissions Act. Such a showdown does not seem far off, but Congress also has a duty to revoke or rewrite the laws that have been abused in the name of national security, starting with the 2006 tribunals law.\n        Lawmakers have only to look to the Canadian court for easy-to-follow directions back to the high ground on basic human rights and civil liberties.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1710558,"ids":1710558,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The White House is making a well-publicized shift in its marketing of Harriet Miers, President Bush's nominee for the Supreme Court. From now on, the talk is to be about her qualifications rather than her heart, her character or, especially, her religion. It's none too soon. The president's attempt to sell his choice on the basis of her evangelical faith has been offensive. Mr. Bush is all in favor of judges strictly interpreting the Constitution, but he seems to have forgotten about Article VI. That's where the founders decreed that ''no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office.''\n        The Bush administration has been using religion as code, to communicate reassurance to the right that Ms. Miers will be opposed to abortion and gay rights, and to dodge legitimate questions about her legal philosophy and qualifications. As a result, the American people have no idea whether Ms. Miers thinks there is a constitutional right to privacy or where she stands on the extent of federal powers, but they do know that she was born a Roman Catholic and became an evangelical Christian. They know that she was a longtime member of the Valley View Christian Church, and that she was one of a small number of worshipers who joined its minister, Ron Key, in breaking away and forming the Cornerstone Christian Church because of a disagreement over styles of worship.\n        When Ms. Miers came under fire from conservatives, President Bush told reporters that ''people ask me why I picked Harriet Miers,'' and then proceeded to talk about the importance of religion in her life. James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, a conservative Christian group, told a radio audience that he had been assured by Karl Rove, President Bush's top political adviser, that Ms. Miers is a member of ''a very conservative church, which is almost universally pro-life.''\n        It is shocking to think that this is the way Americans discuss a Supreme Court nomination in 2005. In the 1960 election, John F. Kennedy struck an important blow for both the separation of church and state and the rights of people of all faiths to be considered for high office when he insisted that his Catholicism should have no bearing on his fitness for the presidency. The Bush administration seems intent on turning back the clock.\n        The White House is invoking Ms. Miers's religious activities as a substitute for talking about her professional qualifications and her views about the law, which remain a mystery. But her qualifications and beliefs about the law are what matter. As this nomination proceeds, both the nation and Ms. Miers will benefit if we hear less about what kind of a Christian she is, and more about what kind of a justice she would be.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1651055,"ids":1651055,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The World Bank goes around the globe preaching transparency, good governance and meritocracy. Yet the process to choose a new leader for the bank is devoid of much of that. Since the bank was established after World War II to finance development in poor countries, its leader has traditionally been an American, chosen in secrecy by the American president and ratified by the bank's executive board -- without any input from other countries that might do business with the bank.\n        That tradition has outlived its time. Today, the decisions made by the bank's president can literally mean life or death for hundreds of millions of people. By treating the job as if it's an ambassadorship to Liechtenstein, we fail to consider the most highly qualified candidates and too easily fall into the trap of using the bank as a tool of American policy.\n        The current president, James Wolfensohn, is an Australian who obtained American citizenship in order to compete for the job. He decentralized the bank's management, sent more top people into the field and emphasized the importance of local support in development projects.\n        Good candidates for the job would know the problems of the third world -- particularly Africa -- and work to solve them. They would probably not be bankers because the World Bank is almost the opposite of a bank. It is a development organization that lends money to cure market failures, financing projects whose returns could not attract other lenders. The bank's president should be able to generate enthusiasm for helping the world's poor. And he or she should have experience running a huge, chaotic bureaucracy.\n        The world does not lack good candidates, like the former presidents Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico and Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, or the former and current finance ministers Gordon Brown of Britain, Trevor Manuel of South Africa, Leszek Balcerowicz of Poland and Kemal Dervis of Turkey.\n        The signals, however, are that the Bush administration will make its choice the old-fashioned way, using a closed process to pick a convenient American. There are credible American candidates, among them Jeffrey Garten of Yale, and, more fancifully, Bill Clinton and Bill Gates. There are even credible Republicans, like the former Michigan State University president, Peter McPherson. One rumored front-runner, John Taylor, a Treasury under secretary, is globally unpopular for his eccentric policy views and poor leadership skills. He would be a very bad choice, but his nomination could finally push the bank into adopting a better selection process for the bank's presidency.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1646524,"ids":1646524,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The achievement gap between rich and poor students is narrowing in some states, thanks to the added resources and better instruction that are a result of the No Child Left Behind Act. But that good news is largely limited to the early grades. Progress is stalled in high schools, where more states are slipping behind than are making progress, and American teenagers have lost ground when compared with their peers in other industrialized nations. The United States, which once led the world in high school graduation rates, has plummeted to 17th -- well behind France, Germany and Japan.\n        The American high school is a big part of the problem. Developed a century ago, the standard factory-style high school was conceived as a combination holding area and sorting device that would send roughly one-fifth of its students on to college while moving the rest directly into low-skill jobs. It has no tools to rescue the students who arrive unable to read at grade level but are in need of the academic grounding that will qualify them for 21st-century employment.\n        New York City recently embarked on a plan to develop a range of smaller schools, some of them aimed at the thousands of students whose literacy skills are so poor that they have failed the first year of high school three times. The plan is to pull these students up to the academic standard while providing some of them with work experiences. The National Governors Association has begun a high school initiative that calls for remedial services and partial tuition reimbursement for students who complete community college courses that lead to technical or industrial job certifications. The White House, rushing to get ahead of the parade, recently announced a high school project of its own. And other school districts are tinkering with gimmicks like cash bonuses for good grades.\n        The emerging consensus is that the traditional high school needs to be remade into something that is both more flexible and more rigorous. But the rigor has to come first. Many states are still setting the bar for reading performance abysmally low in the primary grades, paving the way for failure when children move on to high school. State education departments have fudged vital statistics on graduation rates, as well as the teacher qualification data they have reported to the federal government in ostensible compliance with No Child Left Behind.\n        The federal Education Department failed to push the states toward doing better under the disastrous leadership of its departing secretary, Rod Paige. No matter how hard localities try, the best-designed high schools in the world will still fail unless the states and the federal government finally bite the bullet on teacher training. That means doing what it takes to remake the teacher corps, even if it means withholding federal dollars from diploma mills pretending to be colleges of education, forcing out unqualified teachers and changing the age-old practice of funneling the least-prepared teachers into the weakest schools.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1742722,"ids":1742722,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The administration's tendency to dodge accountability for lawless actions by resorting to secrecy and claims of national security is on sharp display in the case of a Syrian-born Canadian, Maher Arar, who spent months under torture because of United States action. A federal trial judge in Brooklyn has refused to stand up to the executive branch, in a decision that is both chilling and ripe for prompt overturning.\n        Mr. Arar, a 35-year-old software engineer whose case has been detailed in a pair of columns by Bob Herbert, was detained at Kennedy Airport in 2002 while on his way home from a family vacation. He was held in solitary confinement in a Brooklyn detention center and interrogated without proper access to legal counsel. Finally, he was shipped off to a Syrian prison. There, he was held for 10 months in an underground rat-infested dungeon and brutally tortured because officials suspected that he was a member of Al Qaeda. All this was part of a morally and legally unsupportable United States practice known as ''extraordinary rendition,'' in which the federal government outsources interrogations to regimes known to use torture and lacking fundamental human rights protections.\n        The maltreatment of Mr. Arar would be reprehensible -- and illegal under the United States Constitution and applicable treaties -- even had the suspicions of terrorist involvement proven true. But no link to any terrorist organization or activity emerged, which is why the Syrians eventually released him. Mr. Arar then sued for damages.\n        The judge in the case, David Trager of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, did not dispute that United States officials had reason to know that Mr. Arar faced a likelihood of torture in Syria. But he took the rare step of blocking the lawsuit entirely, saying that the use of torture in rendition cases is a foreign policy question not appropriate for court review, and that going forward would mean disclosing state secrets.\n        It is hard to see why resolving Mr. Arar's case would necessitate the revelation of privileged material. Moreover, as the Supreme Court made clear in a pair of 2004 decisions rebuking the government for its policies of holding foreign terrorism suspects in an indefinite legal limbo in Guant\u00e1namo and elsewhere, even during the war on terror, the government's actions are subject to court review and must adhere to the rule of law.\n        With the Bush administration claiming imperial powers to detain, spy on and even torture people, and the Republican Congress stuck largely in enabling mode, the role of judges in checking executive branch excesses becomes all the more crucial. If the courts collapse when confronted with spurious government claims about the needs of national security, so will basic American liberties.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1811744,"ids":1811744,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The announcement yesterday about the results in two African studies of male circumcision may be the most important development in AIDS research since the debut of antiretroviral drugs more than a decade ago. The National Institutes of Health halted studies in Uganda and Kenya when it became overwhelmingly clear that circumcision significantly reduces men's chances of catching H.I.V.\n        The studies recruited men willing to be circumcised and randomly assigned them to immediate surgery or to a control group. In both studies, the circumcised men acquired half the number of H.I.V. infections as their uncircumcised counterparts did. The studies confirm the results of a trial that ended last year in South Africa, in which circumcision prevented 60 to 70 percent of new AIDS infections.\n        Until now, efforts at AIDS prevention have largely failed. Little wonder. It requires people to resolve -- every day -- either not to have sex or to use condoms. Circumcision, by contrast, is a one-time procedure. It is familiar and widely accepted all over the world, even by groups who do not practice it. And safe circumcision does not require a doctor. Community workers and traditional healers can be trained to do the operation safely and given the correct tools.\n        Based on the South African results, groups like the United Nations AIDS program and the World Health Organization were already discussing how they might promote circumcision in countries around the world. They should now move as quickly as possible.\n        Governments and international donors should also work urgently to provide new financing to help high-risk countries train community workers to do safe circumcision. News of the South African results has already led to a surge in demand for the procedure across Africa, and clinics that now offer it have long waiting lists.\n        Any campaign will have to be coupled with warnings that circumcision offers only partial protection against H.I.V. and should not become a license for risky sex. Governments must continue to promote condoms and partner reduction.\n        For years, the holy grail of AIDS prevention has been a vaccine, even one that is only 50 to 60 percent effective. A real vaccine is years away. But as of yesterday, we know its near equivalent exists.

They come and go courtesy of cars and chauffeurs (they like to call them drivers) paid for by taxpayers. And even though it is very hard to figure out how much these fleets actually cost, you can be sure it would be cheaper if these officials took a bus, subway or taxi or even drove and parked their own cars like the rest of us.\n        Nobody wants to deny a strong car and a beefy driver to an official who needs security, but now that Mr. Hevesi is facing investigations for using a state car and driver for his wife, there should be questions for everybody else in government enjoying those perks. Why, for example, should state agency heads have such unrestricted access to cars and drivers that at least one top official has been accused of using her car and driver to go shopping? Or, if security is the measure, why does a local prosecutor or judge who puts a violent gang member in jail have to drive home alone?\n        In some cases, chauffeur-driven officials quickly pay the state and the Internal Revenue Service for any personal use. Since he was caught, Mr. Hevesi has so far paid out more than $170,000 to cover the state-financed transport. Other public officials have hastened to repay even modest amounts. State politicians have repeatedly assured reporters in recent weeks that state cars or drivers are not allowed for personal use, but the questions clearly make them nervous. For example, Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, was so irritated and flustered at the very question that he denied having a driver and then reassured everyone that the driver he did have had never done anything inappropriate.\n        Gov. George Pataki's use of airplanes and limousines has always been hard to track, since his schedule, like much of his administration, is top secret. But that picture is even murkier these days as administration staff members refuse to talk about the policy for car and driver use. They say we might draw a ''moral equivalent'' between Mr. Hevesi's car use and Governor Pataki's transportation use.\n        None of this would be a problem if the state would follow Mayor Michael Bloomberg's lead. Mr. Bloomberg, who is rich enough to commute by helicopter, prefers the subway. Early in his first term, he also took away the lights and sirens from New York City administrators accustomed to turning every routine trip across town into a mock emergency.\n        There are no subways in Albany, and the bus and taxi services are meager. But there is something to be said for anything that reminds public officials that they are no different from other citizens who struggle with traffic jams and subway doors and the ordinary hazards of moving about.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1673910,"ids":1673910,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The arrival last week of a sweeping, bipartisan immigration proposal in Congress brought forth the usual conflict between those who want a solution and those who just want an emotional issue to howl about. But this latest and most comprehensive package has already started earning support from Republicans and Democrats, business groups and unions, and several key Hispanic organizations. President Bush, who has been promising action on immigration for years, should quickly join them.\n        The long-awaited legislation comes from Senators John McCain and Edward Kennedy and Representatives Jeff Flake and Jim Kolbe, both Republicans from Arizona, and Luis Gutierrez, a Democrat from Illinois. Senator McCain said as he introduced the bill that it embraced the goals set down by Mr. Bush: making the borders more secure, filling jobs no American will take and finding a route to legality for workers who are already here illegally.\n        It is worth noting that three of the prime movers on this effort are from Arizona, a border state. They know firsthand about the hundreds who die each year trying to cross the desert from Mexico and about the many locals who are frantic about being overrun in this tragic human stampede.\n        Given the political tides, Senator McCain and others have focused on how their package could improve security at the borders. More than a million undocumented people are caught trying to cross into the country each year. Many make it: an estimated 11 million people are in the country illegally.\n        The goal is to get as many of these workers as possible to come out of their shadowy world. If that happened as planned, the strained government agencies that now deal with border issues could focus on immigrants with more sinister motives than the need for better wages.\n        At the center of this bill is a new temporary visa program that would allow foreign workers to fill jobs that no Americans will take. Undocumented immigrants already in the country would be eligible for these visas, which could last up to six years. To apply for permanent status, these workers would have to clear a number of hurdles, including security checks and requirements to pay back taxes and fines of $2,000 or more, and be proficient in English. Even then, they would go to the back of the immigration line. That process should be difficult enough to keep this from being an amnesty program, but not be so daunting that nobody would bother to try.\n        As Congressman Kolbe put it last week, this legislation ''doesn't try to solve the hemorrhaging immigration problem with simply a Band-Aid. This is major surgery.''

There is no evidence that Ms. Schiavo's husband did any of the awful things attributed to him, and no hope that her greatly damaged brain would ever have recovered. The courts were right to conclude that she should be allowed to die after 15 years in what her doctors described as a persistent vegetative state with no hope of recovery.\n        The autopsy and a broader investigation conducted by medical examiners in Florida inevitably left some questions without definitive answers. That reflects the limitations of a pathological examination and the uncertainties of clinical medicine. But what the inquiry did reveal leaves little doubt that death was the merciful finale to this tragic case.\n        The medical examiners found Ms. Schiavo's brain ''profoundly atrophied,'' only half the normal size, and said that ''no amount of therapy or treatment would have regenerated the massive loss of neurons.'' Although the autopsy could not definitively establish that Ms. Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state, the findings were deemed ''very consistent'' with that diagnosis. She was completely blind and could not have swallowed food or water safely on her own. Those conclusions underscore how shallow and cynical were the judgments-from-afar by the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, who is a doctor, and by other Republicans in Congress who contended that Ms. Schiavo looked responsive and that her condition might be amenable to treatment.\n        The medical investigation disproved paranoid theories that Michael Schiavo had injured his wife, either at the time of the accident or while she lay in medical institutions all those years. The autopsy was unable to pinpoint what caused her collapse in 1990, but the inquiry found no evidence of neglect, abuse, strangulation or other trauma. Nor did it find that any poison, drugs or other substances had been administered to her to hasten her death.\n        The findings will not satisfy Ms. Schiavo's parents, who remain convinced that she interacted with them before her death and could have responded to treatment. The family's lawyer argued yesterday that Ms. Schiavo had not been facing imminent death when her feeding tube was withdrawn. That was true in the sense that she could have been kept alive with a feeding tube. But according to testimony from her husband that the courts found credible, such a life was not what she would have wanted.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1726502,"ids":1726502,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The bar for job actions by New York City transit workers is set, legally, out of reach for good reason. A strike that halts buses and subways that daily carry seven million riders can devastate New York's economy and countless lives. The New Yorkers who took to the streets yesterday, some walking miles to work or other appointments, deserved better than the explanation they got from leaders of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union -- who said they had no choice but to tell their 33,000 members to begin an illegal walkout. That's ridiculous.\n        Negotiations did not have to end when they did. There was no impasse. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state entity that runs the system, had compromised on several major points at the negotiating table. When Roger Toussaint, the union chief, walked away, his members were being offered a chance to continue to retire with full pensions at age 55. New hires would have to pay into that pension, but workers would continue to pay nothing toward their health benefits. That's a deal that many riders, including those who struggle to pay the $2 fare, would gladly take.\n        The authority also made other concessions, including a better wage offer, that could be seen as generous, considering that its finances will be awash in red ink for foreseeable years and it cannot just let fares skyrocket to pay for any deal it cuts for its workers.\n        Many other issues remain to be hammered out, but none justify a strike, especially in the frigid days before the holidays. While New Yorkers fought the freezing cold, the transit union leaders seemed to be steamed about the enormous number of disciplinary actions against their members. The issue deserves study, but even the transit workers' parent union did not see it as sufficient reason to strike.\n        Mayor Michael Bloomberg's strike contingency plan appeared to help move people who car-pooled. Beyond that, he can offer only a bully pulpit and the kind of moral support he displayed when he took a page from Ed Koch and walked -- hatless -- across the windswept Brooklyn Bridge with others who hoofed it to their jobs yesterday. Clearly angry, the mayor demanded an end to the strike before talks resume, but that is not his call, and the sequence is less important than ending the strike fast.\n        Mr. Toussaint should not have the ability to hold the city hostage. That he can do so says little about the leadership on the other side of the table. The executives of the M.T.A. answer to Gov. George Pataki. We understand that Mr. Pataki has higher aspirations, but it was a bad call to visit New Hampshire as the first strike deadline approached and the city was increasingly anxious.

It is easy, in that matchup, to side with the student. But when the Supreme Court takes up the issue this week, we hope it considers another party to the dispute: individual creators of music, movies and books, who need to keep getting paid if they are going to keep creating. If their work is suddenly made ''free,'' all of society is likely to suffer.\n        The court hears arguments tomorrow in a suit by music and movie companies against Grokster, which makes ''peer to peer'' software that allows Internet users to exchange songs and other computer files. At least 90 percent of the material ''shared'' on Grokster, and perhaps more, is copyrighted. Grokster gives away the software, but it sells advertising aimed at the millions of people who use it.\n        Many big entertainment companies are backing the suit, along with marquee-name musicians like the Eagles and the Dixie Chicks. But so are some creative professionals -- represented by groups like the Authors Guild and the Professional Photographers of America -- for whom even a few thousand dollars in royalties makes a big difference.\n        The technology community has rallied to Grokster's defense. Its most radical members argue that ''information wants to be free'' online and disparage the whole idea of intellectual property. A more modest argument, and one Grokster relies on in court, is that if it loses, there will be a chilling effect on technological innovation.\n        The legal case against Grokster is far from a slam-dunk, and we have been wary of it in the past. The court ruled, in a landmark 1984 case, that Betamax video recorders were legal even though they were used to copy copyrighted material, because they had significant legal uses. It is true that there are legal uses for Grokster -- not every file exchanged is copyrighted. But it is notable how much illegal use predominates, and how much its business model relies on theft.\n        The founders wrote copyright protections into the Constitution because they believed that they were necessary for progress. Movies, music and books require investments of money and time. If their creators cannot make money from them, many will be unwilling or unable to keep producing. Or they may have to finance their work in troubling ways, like by building in product placements or taking money from donors with agendas.\n        Grokster's supporters are justified in worrying that if the courts are too quick to rein in new technology, innovation can be stifled. They are also right to point out that copyright has sometimes been given too much protection, notably in the Copyright Term Extension Act, which gratuitously added 20 years to existing copyrights. But these concerns do not erase the continuing importance of intellectual property, which is unquestionably under assault.\n        Both the court and Congress should be sensitive to evolving technologies. But they should not let technology evolve in a way that deprives people who create of the ability to be paid for their work.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1724607,"ids":1724607,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The best that can be said of the recently concluded meeting on climate change in Montreal is that the countries that care about global warming did not allow the United States delegation to blow the whole conference to smithereens.

It cannot be easy for America's competitors to move forward with costly steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while the United States refuses to carry its share of the load. Nevertheless, the Europeans and other signatories to the 1997 treaty limiting greenhouse gas emissions -- a treaty the Bush administration has rejected -- promised to work toward new and more ambitious targets and timetables when the agreement lapses in 2012.\n        For its part, the Bush administration deserves only censure. No one expected a miraculous conversion. But given the steadily mounting evidence of the present and potential consequences of climate change -- disappearing glaciers, melting Arctic ice caps, dying coral reefs, threatened coastlines, increasingly violent hurricanes -- one would surely have expected America's negotiators to arrive in Montreal willing to discuss alternatives.\n        They did not. Instead, the principal negotiators, Paula Dobriansky and Harlan Watson, continued to tout the benefits of an approach that combines voluntary reductions by individual companies with further research into ''breakthrough'' technologies.\n        That will not work. While a few companies may decide to proceed on their own, the private sector as a whole will neither create new technologies nor broadly deploy them unless all countries are required to do their share under a regime that combines agreed-upon targets with strong financial incentives for reaching them. To believe that companies will spend heavily to reduce emissions while their competitors are not doing the same is to believe in the tooth fairy.\n        The Europeans are finding solace in the fact that the Americans -- after much kicking and screaming, and after public rebukes by Canada's prime minister and a surprise visitor named Bill Clinton -- finally agreed to join informal ''nonbinding'' discussions that will try to entice developing countries like China and India into the process. It's certainly true that without the developing nations on board, any effort to keep greenhouses gases at manageable levels will be for naught. China, for example, is building coal-fired power plants at a rapid clip and is expected to overtake the United States as the biggest producer of greenhouse gases in 20 years.\n        But talk is cheap, and nonbinding talk is even cheaper. And talk alone will not get the developing world into the game. Why should India and China make major sacrifices while the United States, in effect, gets a free ride?

But we find it chilling to imagine that Mr. Bush and his advisers have only now begun a full policy review, months after Iraq plunged into civil war and years after experts began warning that the administration's strategy was not working.\n        We would like to believe that the reason for delay is that some of Mr. Bush's advisers have come up with a sensible change in course and they are now trying to persuade the president to take it. Or that behind the scenes Mr. Bush is already strong-arming Iraq's leaders to rein in the sectarian militias and begin long-delayed national reconciliation talks.\n        We fear that a more likely explanation is that the president's ever-divided policy advisers are still wrangling over the most basic decisions, while his political handlers are waiting for public enthusiasm for the Baker report to flag before Mr. Bush tries to explain why he won't follow through on some of the report's most important and reasonable suggestions -- like imposing a timetable on Iraqi leaders to make political compromises or face a withdrawal of American support. Or trying to persuade Iran and Syria to cease their meddling.\n        The Baker study, of course, is not the received wisdom of the ages. It should have been released far earlier, rather than being delayed to get past the midterm elections. But it was a good-faith effort by people wise enough and experienced enough to know how bad the situation really is in Iraq, and how little time left there is for the president to act.\n        Mr. Bush has no more time to waste on ''listening tours'' and photo ops. The nation is in a crisis, and Americans need to hear how he plans to unwind the chaos he has unleashed in Iraq. If the president is delaying because he is searching for a good option, he can stop. There are none. But Americans need to see that he is prepared to choose among the undesirable alternatives, and clear the way for a withdrawal of American troops that does not leave even more killing and mayhem behind.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1747588,"ids":1747588,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The clock was running out on the Senate Judiciary Committee this week, and with it the chances for a meaningful overhaul of the nation's immigration laws. After weeks of work, the committee members faced a rigid deadline to get a bill ready before next week's recess. But about all they had agreed on were various ways to tighten the borders. It was increasingly likely that Congress's message to 12 million illegal immigrants would end up being this: Thanks for the help -- now get out.\n        But in a startling pivot, so sharp you could almost hear it, a bipartisan consensus emerged in the hearing room. Senator Arlen Specter, the committee's chairman, endorsed the principle behind an earlier bill sponsored by Senators John McCain and Edward Kennedy: that illegal immigrants who met strict criteria and paid fines and back taxes should have a path to permanent residency and citizenship.\n        Mr. Specter said he was all for that, as long as the country first cleared up the backlog of three million foreigners seeking to come here through legal channels. The panel also neared an agreement on a related proposal to allow foreign guest workers to enter legally and earn permanent status. Mr. Specter said he wanted a comprehensive bill ready when Congress reconvened on March 27, the deadline set by the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, who has his own hard-line border-tightening bill waiting in the wings.\n        The blowback was instantaneous. Mr. Frist announced that he would be putting his own bill forward as an alternative to the committee's. Seventy-one House members signed a letter saying that the Judiciary Committee's actions were ''fundamentally incompatible'' with the House's strident vision of immigration reform, which completely rejects the idea of providing illegal immigrants any path to legalization.\n        Mr. Specter often wilts under party pressure like lettuce in a broiler, but he has shown admirable resilience in working to get a comprehensive immigration bill to the Senate floor. His committee's emergent consensus, fragile but real, has finally pointed to a way out of what has been a bitter struggle between starkly conflicting visions of what America should do about immigration. For too long the debate has been hijacked by stereotypes. The recent waves of newcomers are not all potential terrorists living among us like pod people. Nor is every last one a model-citizen-in-waiting.\n        The chances of finally fixing the immigration system depend on Congress's recognition and acceptance of what President Bush has said for years: that immigration reform is about far more than border enforcement, and that there is a way to bring order and lawfulness to an unauthorized population without compromising the values and traditions of our robust immigrant nation.\n        Mr. Specter's compromise has wisely elevated the discussion by endorsing a balanced approach. That means making the borders more secure, trying to match the supply of work visas with the demand, and sending this message to the illegal immigrants who are already here: Come out of the shadows, and join your neighbors in making America a better place.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1645744,"ids":1645744,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The conditions under which Iraqis will be voting tomorrow are obviously bad: a poorly prepared election conducted in an atmosphere of escalating violence and lawlessness. But the time for addressing those problems is past. It's important now to focus on the hope that a reasonably successful election can be a large first step toward a self-governing and stable Iraq that can survive without huge numbers of American troops.\n        That sounds like a goal everyone should support. Yet thousands of Iraqi insurgents are expected to mount violent attacks while millions of other Iraqis -- the intimidated and the alienated -- seem likely to sit out the vote.\n        Given those realities, the bar for relative electoral success is low: a fairly high nationwide turnout that includes some significant elements of all major Iraqi religious and ethnic communities. It seems certain that Sunni Arabs, a minority, will vote in numbers below their representation in Iraq's population because of the rampant insecurity in Sunni-dominated provinces north and west of Baghdad. But the damage could be limited if sufficient numbers of Sunni voters elsewhere ignored the advice of most Sunni political leaders and cast their votes.\n        The most important task of the new 275-seat legislature will be drafting a new constitution, and it's heartening to see some leading politicians from Shiite parties acknowledge the importance of adequate Sunni participation. The more moderate Sunni leaders, while still calling for an election boycott, are nevertheless making it clear that they do want to be involved in the constitutional debate after the election. We hope that happens under any circumstances, but the best way to guarantee such participation would be for Sunni politicians to urge those of their followers who live in secure areas to vote.\n        The issue of Sunni participation did not have to become this dicey. More energetic and systematic efforts to integrally involve representative Sunni leaders, including former Baathists and nationalists from insurgent zones, should have begun long ago, even before Washington handed power to the current interim government, which is dominated by exile-rooted parties and Shiite and Kurdish politicians.\n        Numerous opportunities since then have been foolishly passed up. Even as late as last month, when the extent of Sunni Arab alienation from the election process became overwhelmingly evident, a willingness to consider postponing the voting until this spring in exchange for a voter drive led by Sunnis might have helped.\n        One reason that possibility was never seriously explored was the Bush administration's insistence on holding to the original election timetable. Washington gambled that a January vote would please the Shiites and Kurds and that if it credibly established a new legislature and constitutional assembly, large numbers of Sunnis would turn their back on the insurgency and rush into the arms, and armed forces, of the new government. The wisdom of that gamble will be clearer after tomorrow's vote.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1647258,"ids":1647258,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The confirmation of Alberto Gonzales as attorney general yesterday was depressing. The president deserves a great deal of leeway in choosing his own cabinet. But beyond his other failings, Mr. Gonzales has come to represent the administration's role in paving the way for the abuse and torture of prisoners by American soldiers and intelligence agents. Giving him the nation's top legal post is a terrible signal to send the rest of the world, and to American citizens concerned with human rights.\n        The 60-to-36 vote for confirmation was also preceded by a depressing debate. There was the usual comic opera of these Senate votes, with the president's party piously denouncing all opposition as outrageous politicking and the opposition piously denying it. But this debate had a sinister overtone as well: in a ham-handed way, the Republicans tried to portray a vote against Mr. Gonzales as an act of bigotry.\n        Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, declaring that ''I love the Hispanic people,'' warned that Hispanic Americans were ''sensing there's something unfair going on.'' Using that ''more in sorrow than in anger'' tone that senators reserve for their most blatantly political comments, he added, ''I suspect there's more than politics being played here.''\n        Mr. Gonzales has the kind of life story that all Americans should admire, and that many can find in their families. The value of diversity in the cabinet is indisputable. But it is also irrelevant here. Mr. Gonzales was a bad choice for attorney general because of his record, not his ethnic background.\n        It was Mr. Gonzales who asked for the original legal advice from the Justice Department on the treatment of prisoners in the ''war on terror.'' There was no need to go through that exercise; the rules were clear. But Mr. Gonzales gave the president the flexibility he wanted, first in the Justice Department memo outlining ways to make torture seem legal, and then by offering the Orwellian argument that the president can declare himself above the law and can order illegal actions like detaining prisoners without a hearing and authorizing torture.\n        Republican senators made much of the fact that the White House repudiated the original memo on torture -- after it became public. But this is not just a matter of historical interest. Mr. Gonzales testified that he agreed with the substance of the original torture memo, and he still takes the view that the president can declare himself to be above the law. In written responses to senators' questions, Mr. Gonzales argued that intelligence agents could ''abuse'' prisoners as long as they did it to foreigners outside the United States.\n        Republican senators argued that it was unfair to say Mr. Gonzales was personally responsible for the specific acts of torture and degradation at Abu Ghraib. That would be a fair defense if anyone were doing that. The Democrats simply said, rightly, that Mr. Gonzales was one of the central architects of the administration's policy of evading legal restrictions on the treatment of prisoners. He should not have been rewarded with one of the most important jobs in the cabinet.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1643462,"ids":1643462,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The continuing high costs of the Iraq war are finally forcing the Pentagon to pare back its order lists for unneeded and extravagant cold war weapons. That should have been done years ago. The Defense Department will have to go well beyond its current cost-cutting plans if it wants to be able to afford the ground-warfare soldiers and battle systems it desperately needs today and to develop the more advanced weaponry likely to be needed in coming decades. Even the spendthrift Bush administration recognizes that it can no longer afford to keep buying all the wish-list weapons designed in the late 20th century for fighting a high-tech superpower foe.\n        Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, compelled for the first time to make hard budget choices, is mainly starting with the right targets. The Air Force and Navy are now being asked to trim spending on some of their less essential new weapons systems over the next six years. The cutbacks will reduce deliveries of the Air Force's cherished but indefensible F\/A-22 stealth fighter. Production timetables will be slowed for the Navy's new Virginia-class nuclear submarines and a new destroyer still under development. Roughly half of the $55 billion in the expected savings will be transferred to Army programs. The rest will allow the military budget to rise at a slower rate than previously projected. But it will rise all the same, to record levels, even without counting the direct costs of the Iraq war, which continues to be misleadingly financed through separate spending measures.\n        Unfortunately, Mr. Rumsfeld is proceeding much too tentatively, reducing programs that should be eliminated and reaping current savings by merely deferring wasteful purchases to future budget years. The long, wasteful history of Pentagon budgeting clearly demonstrates that the only way to terminate weapons that no longer make sense is to kill them outright. Otherwise, military-contractor lobbyists are sure to mobilize every member of Congress whose district could lose jobs to get production lines back into operation.\n        Those contractor counteroffensives usually succeed because it is very hard to argue against the combination of high-performance weapons and local jobs. To make the case for his proposed cuts, Mr. Rumsfeld may want to remind protesting lawmakers in the House and Senate who ultimately bear the real cost of wasteful and misdirected Pentagon spending: the American soldiers and marines sent into battle in places like Iraq, where stealth fighters and nuclear submarines are not particularly useful and ground troops, armor and working vehicles are chronically in short supply.\n        This nation spends more on its military than any other in history, and nearly as much as the rest of the world combined. Directing more of that money toward real defense needs is long overdue.","adu_anecdote":3,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1845501,"ids":1845501,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The deaths of two subways workers, each hit by trains in separate accidents in the last two weeks, reminds us that maintaining New York's subway tracks is necessary and dangerous work. The system is vital to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, requiring expeditious repair when things break down; it is also a century old, with many original and near-original components that need constant attention or replacement.\n        Regrettably, safety mechanisms are also out-of-date, forcing workmen to rely largely on their senses to avoid accidents. Even though the two deaths may well have resulted from plain old human error, and not any technological shortcoming, the system's horse-and-buggy procedures need to be brought into the 21st century.\n        On April 24, Daniel Boggs, a 41-year-old veteran track worker, may simply not have looked for an oncoming train when he stepped in the path of a No. 3 express train at Columbus Circle. Mr. Boggs was in the process of ''flagging'' -- setting up a warning lantern -- to signal that crews were at work up ahead. Days later, another worker, 55-year-old Marvin Franklin, may have been killed when he tried to carry equipment across the tracks instead of taking a longer way around.\n        The response from the new transit leadership was a reassuring departure from years of management by confrontation. Elliot Sander, the chief executive of the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and his municipal counterpart, Howard Roberts, of the New York City Transit Authority, moved quickly to consult with the transport workers union and to halt temporarily all but emergency repair work on the system's more than 600 miles of tracks. They also ordered refresher safety courses for all of the more than 6,000 maintenance workers.\n        The safety course is emphasizing that workers cannot take short cuts, and that's a good start. There have been six transit worker deaths since 2002, and hundreds of accidents every year, and human error has obviously played a role. But so, too, have the trying work conditions -- employees must often do heavy lifting in dimly lit environments -- and the absence of all but the most rudimentary forms of communication.\n        The system is clearly due for a top-to-bottom review of safety procedures and equipment. Two other back-to-back track worker deaths in 2002 resulted in a tightening of safety rules, including a requirement for more flagging to warn train operators of work being done ahead. But as Mr. Boggs's death demonstrated, even flagging can be hazardous. And as officials pointed out, improvements that greatly enhance the communiting experience -- including quieter trains running on smoother tracks -- have had the unintended consequence of removing an element of warning for maintenance crews.\n        The gap could be filled with newer technologies, perhaps sensors like those being developed for automobiles that could automatically slam the brakes when they detect large objects -- humans or machinery -- on the tracks ahead. In the meantime, officials should consider upgrading basic equipment, providing workers with radios and walkie-talkies and improving lighting.\n        Track workers clearly deserve more protection than they get now.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1771676,"ids":1771676,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The debate over what to do with New York City's trash has not been blessed with common sense and political will. Since Mayor Rudolph Giuliani closed the city's only landfill five years ago, New York has been asked to make do with a stopgap system of trucks to haul away tens of thousands of tons of daily rubbish. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has found a better way to manage the city's solid waste. His plan would get trucks off the road and make each borough responsible for its own trash. It spreads the burden, reduces the concentration of waste transfer sites in poorer communities and shifts from diesel-spewing trucks to barges and rail.\n        Because the plan's placement of transfer sites hangs together like a Calder mobile, the City Council should adopt it without too much tampering. There would be four city-operated marine transfer sites for residential trash: two in Brooklyn, one in Queens and one in Manhattan. Other sites will handle commercial waste and recycling. There would be three privately-run marine transfer stations for residential trash, once each in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.\n        Council members will have to stand up to muscular opposition to the proposed Manhattan facilities: the marine transfer station on East 91st Street, a commercial waste site on West 59th Street and a recycling point at Gansevoort, on the Lower West Side. Christine Quinn, the speaker, has already shown an impressively independent streak on lobbying reform. Now she is backing the Gansevoort station, which is in her Lower West Side district. In doing so, Ms. Quinn has taken on supporters of the Hudson River Park, who challenge the site's legality and express understandable concerns about its impact on park space. A recycling transfer point need not harm the park or its use. Gansevoort now has garages for sanitation trucks and a storage site for salt to de-ice roads. These would be torn down. The transfer station would use some of that land; the rest would be park.\n        Ms. Quinn's predecessor, Gifford Miller, opposed the East 91st Street marine transfer station in his district. But he never offered a better idea and neither has anyone else. As for West 59th Street, a commercial waste site is without question necessary for Manhattan, which produces 40 percent of business trash.\n        Privately run transfer stations would take about half of the city's residential trash away, most likely by rail. The other half, from the city-operated transfer stations, would likely be sent by barge to a single terminal for loading onto rail cars, then sent to landfills in other states.\n        It makes sense to have a central receiving terminal for city barges. But it could also present a choke point just where the trash is supposed to leave New York for good. Michael McMahon, a councilman from Staten Island, where the terminal is likely to be, favors redundancy in the system. He has a point. The city should not rule out sending trash barges to other ports, perhaps in New Jersey.\n        The overall plan should also seek to expand recycling to businesses, schools and government offices, where efforts are cursory at best. Ultimately, the task of successfully managing trash will require not just burial or incineration, but reuse and reduction of rubbish as well.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1703896,"ids":1703896,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The decision by Congressional leaders to delay action on their tax-and-spending bills was most welcome. The bills' broad outlines were drawn up pre-Katrina, and were objectionable even then: spending cuts totaling $35 billion over five years in programs for low-and moderate-income families, and $70 billion in new tax breaks, mostly for the most affluent families. Counting interest, the bills would increase the deficit by $40 billion over five years.\n        Post-Katrina, those plans would be scandalous, highlighting the skewed priorities that have put the country into a tight financial spot as it copes both with hurricane damage and with the social and economic rifts that Katrina has exposed.\n        Unfortunately, it's increasingly unclear why Congress imposed the delay. (The deadlines were shifted into October and early November.) Initially, it appeared that lawmakers needed time to recast their priorities -- away from budget cuts that would reduce the aid for hurricane victims and other needy Americans, and away from high-end tax cuts that would needlessly starve the Treasury at a time of mounting rebuilding costs.\n        Now, however, it appears that postponement may be only a tactical move to recast Katrina as the event that requires Congress to hack away at existing programs to pre-empt unacceptably large deficits from reconstruction spending. That's false.\n        Katrina cannot and should not be paid for by cutting government programs, unless the goal is to end up with a government that's even less effective than it was before Katrina. True, there's fat that Congress should trim. But even if members of Congress were willing to rescind the porkiest of the pork spending they approved in the highway bill passed last summer, doing that would raise about $24 billion.\n        That would be a nice offset for the estimated $200 billion price tag for Katrina, but hardly enough. Bigger cuts that have been suggested, like delaying the start of the Medicare drug coverage plan, are not workable, not to mention political nonstarters for President Bush and for Republican leaders.\n        What is needed most is more revenue, and that requires Congress to stop cutting taxes.\n        But Congress appears to be angling to proceed with business as usual while disguising what it is doing. If all goes according to plan, Congress will take up the spending-cut bill weeks before the tax-cut bill.\n        That would be the first time lawmakers had split such deficit-bloating legislation into two separate bills, raising the suspicion that they're trying to hide the fact that $35 billion in spending cuts, heartless and misguided as they are, would be used to help pay for the $70 billion in new tax breaks -- not for deficit reduction and certainly not for Katrina.\n        The lawmakers' only responsible course of action is to give up on tax cuts, but they are balking. Wedded to tax cuts himself, President Bush cannot lead them where they need to go.

A report by Barry Meier in The Times yesterday revealed that the agency received a report from the manufacturer detailing the flaws months before the F.D.A. issued a safety alert on the devices. By the time the agency acted, a college student relying on the implanted defibrillator to shock any erratic heart beats back to normal had died while mountain biking. His unit had short-circuited, just as the same model did earlier in about two dozen other patients.\n        What is disturbing is how long it took the company, the Guidant Corporation, and the regulators to get a meaningful warning to doctors and patients. The company is required to submit an annual report to the F.D.A. that includes data on how often, and why, its devices fail. As it turned out, the company waited until mid-February of this year to submit a report that covered the year from June 1, 2003, to May 31, 2004. The eight-month lag seems intolerably long for devices that can mean life or death. In previous years, Guidant had submitted reports within three months of the period covered.\n        The report revealed that 10 of the problematic devices suffered short circuits during the year. This was surely information of potentially great importance to doctors and patients. The student mountain biker died in March. Neither he nor his doctors were aware of the short-circuiting problem.\n        The regulators also appeared lethargic. The F.D.A. has a policy of reviewing the annual reports within 90 days, but it is unclear whether the regulators read Guidant's report by mid-May. There is no indication that the agency took any action in response to it. Only when The Times was about to publish an article on the flawed devices in late May did the company issue an alert to doctors, followed in June by an alert from the F.D.A.\n        The agency's excuse for not making the failure data public right away is too feeble to withstand scrutiny. Although F.D.A. officials have sometimes claimed that the annual reports are proprietary documents that must be kept confidential, they now acknowledge that the failure data itself is not confidential. The problem, they say, is that the failure data is included in a report that contains other proprietary information. It would be an inefficient use of time and resources, the agency says, to plow through hundreds of annual filings to determine what information could be released and what had to be kept confidential.\n        If that is the only problem, the solution is simple: require the companies to submit the failure data separately in a form that can be released immediately.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1846520,"ids":1846520,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The difference between mainstream hawks and mainstream doves on Iraq seems to have boiled down to two months, with House Democrats now demanding visible progress by July while moderate Republicans are willing to give White House policies until September, but no longer, to show results.\n        Then there is President Bush, who has yet to acknowledge the reality that Congressional Republicans and even administration officials like Defense Secretary Robert Gates now seem to tacitly accept. Three months into Mr. Bush's troop escalation, there is no real security in Baghdad and no measurable progress toward reconciliation, while American public support for this folly has all but run out.\n        The really important question now facing Washington is the one Mr. Bush still refuses to address: how, while there is still some time left, to design an exit strategy that contains the chaos in Iraq and minimizes the damage to United States interests when American troops inevitably leave.\n        There was no shortage of reminders this week of how swiftly and thoroughly the political landscape has shifted against the war. Yesterday, the House voted to approve the next two months worth of war spending, linking further money to a progress report from the administration in July. On Tuesday, a delegation of Republican moderates went to the White House to warn Mr. Bush that they could not continue supporting his war beyond September unless conditions improved markedly.\n        As one participant, Representative Ray Lahood of Illinois, remarked later, ''I don't know if he's gotten that kind of opinion before in such a frank and no-holds-barred way.'' The session was all the more significant considering that less than two weeks had passed since the same Republican moderates voted to sustain Mr. Bush's veto of a bill that set a March 2008 date for withdrawing American combat troops.\n        Yesterday brought Tony Blair's announcement that he will step down as Britain's prime minister next month. He chose to go out on a high note, after the formation of a new Northern Ireland government joining Sinn Fein with its fiercest Protestant foes. That is a historic achievement. But it cannot disguise the way Mr. Blair's once boundless prospects and personal credibility imploded after he became Mr. Bush's most articulate enabler on Iraq.\n        If Mr. Bush hopes to salvage anything from his 20 months left in office, and, more to the point, if he wants to play a constructive role in the accelerating Iraq endgame, he needs to understand how much has changed in this country, and how tragically little has changed in Iraq.\n        The American people are no longer willing to write blank checks of blood and treasure to an Iraqi government that has refused to stop rampaging Shiite militias, has failed to approve constitutional changes to bring estranged Sunni Arabs back into the political system, and has still not come up with a way to share oil revenues fairly. Now it wants to give itself a two-month summer vacation.\n        Mr. Bush needs to face up to this grim reality and abandon his fantasies of ultimate victory and vindication.

They must train and inspire new teachers, manage budgets, schedule classes, interact with often troubled families, and keep clean, orderly buildings -- all while raising standards and improving student performance, as is now required by federal law. This walk-on-water job requires sound training and a good support system. But it also requires experience, especially in challenging school systems like New York City's, which is on the verge of giving principals even more responsibility.\n        It's therefore disturbing that, as The Times's Elissa Gootman reported recently, New York's most experienced principals have been fleeing the system in alarming numbers. Over the last five years, more than half have left their jobs. Most retired, but union statistics -- which don't include detailed reasons for leaving -- show that more than 200 left for reasons ''other than retirement.'' As a result, a city system that once viewed educators with even 10 years' experience as too green to lead a school has grown increasingly dependent on young people -- some still in their 20's -- who have spent relatively little time in the school system.\n        Joel Klein, the New York City schools chancellor, invokes corporate metaphors about fresh blood when asked about the turnover. He admits losing some principals whom he would rather have kept. But he attributes the exodus to the normal process of retirement and the fear among some principals of being held more closely accountable for how their schools are run. The principals' union, for its part, says that some people have left the job because they have not been given enough administrative help to meet their new responsibilities.\n        The union also points to the current performance bonus program, which encourages some principals to retire in the year they get one because pensions are calculated on the final-year salary. Allowing principals to defer the bonus until the retirement year of their choice might encourage them to stay longer, but it would require permission from the State Legislature. These matters can all be addressed in current contract negotiations.\n        It is imperative that the city keep its best principals on the job as long as possible. Mr. Klein needs to look at the bonus issue and make sure the principals get the support services they need to accomplish the ambitious goals he has rightly set out for them.

The bill, approved by a House-Senate conference early Tuesday morning, does not take the bold steps necessary to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil, and it also fails to address the looming problem of global warming.\n        These shortcomings are chiefly the fault of the White House and its retainers in the House. To be sure, the Senate showed no more courage than the House in its refusal to increase fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks, even though higher standards, by common consent, are the easiest, quickest and most technologically feasible way to reduce oil demand and cut foreign imports.\n        But the Senate did approve a renewable fuels provision requiring power plants to produce 10 percent of their electricity from nontraditional sources, like wind power, by 2010. It also approved a provision that would ask the president to reduce domestic oil consumption by one million barrels a day by whatever means he chose. The House conferees rejected both proposals.\n        Meanwhile, both houses conspired in some spectacular giveaways. One would ease environmental restrictions on oil and gas companies drilling on public lands. The other would shower billions in undeserved tax breaks on the same companies, even as they wallow in the windfall profits produced by $60-a-barrel oil.\n        The bill's most useful provisions may take years to realize their promise. Again thanks largely to the Senate, the tax provisions are far more hospitable to energy efficiency and renewable fuels than earlier versions of the bill, and include substantial incentives for buyers of fuel-efficient hybrid cars.\n        More important in the long run, however, may be two provisions, buried deep in the bill, that are aimed at developing new energy technologies. One provision would encourage the development and commercial application of biofuels from agricultural products that, much like corn-based ethanol, might someday be used as a substitute for gasoline. The other provision is aimed at developing new clean-coal technologies to turn coal into a gas and, more important, capture emissions of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming.\n        These could be powerful new tools in any future effort to reshape the way Americans produce and use energy. But the success of both will depend on the willingness of the government to put money into them. That, in turn, will require a deeper commitment to a more adventurous energy policy than this administration has so far displayed.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1798212,"ids":1798212,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The escalating debate over the relative risks and benefits of eating seafood veered toward the benefits this week. Two authoritative scientific assessments -- one from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, the other from researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health -- concluded that for most people the health benefits of eating finfish and shellfish clearly exceed any risks from contamination by toxic chemicals, heavy metals or microbes.\n        Even vulnerable groups, like pregnant women and young children, could benefit by eating more fish if they avoided the most contaminated species. Both studies were financed by federal agencies, insulating them from commercial influences.\n        The Institute of Medicine panel judged seafood to be a good source of high-quality protein that is low in saturated fat and rich in many vitamins and minerals. It found that eating fish can reduce the risk of heart disease, though whether this comes from substituting lean fish for fatty meats or from the protective effects of fish oils remains uncertain.\n        Infants whose mothers ate fish while pregnant might also benefit from longer gestation and better vision and brain development. Pregnant or breast-feeding women and young children should avoid large predatory fish -- shark, swordfish, tilefish and king mackerel -- and limit their intake of albacore tuna to avoid exposure to contaminants.\n        The Harvard study was even more emphatic on the virtues of seafood. It found that eating a modest amount of fish reduces the risk of death from coronary heart disease by 36 percent. The lead author said he was surprised to find how little evidence of harm exists and concluded that the benefits ''greatly outweigh the risks,'' a fact that has been ''lost on the public.''\n        However, it is dismaying how many important questions remain unresolved. Evidence suggesting that people who have suffered heart attacks might ward off future attacks by eating seafood is weaker than previously thought. It remains unclear whether consuming seafood might reduce the risk of diabetes, cancer or Alzheimer's, as some studies suggest. Reliable data on the distribution of important contaminants is lacking. And there is little evidence on how the beneficial effects of seafood might counteract the risk from contaminants.\n        While the scientists address those questions, consumers could use help. Better labeling on packages of fish or at the fish counter could make it easier to figure out which fish to eat and which to avoid.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1847348,"ids":1847348,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The explosion in the use of three anti-anemia drugs to treat cancer and kidney patients illustrates much that is wrong in the American pharmaceutical marketplace. Thanks to big payoffs to doctors, and reckless promotional ads permitted by lax regulators, the drugs have reached blockbuster status. Now we learn that the dosage levels routinely injected or given intravenously in doctors' offices and dialysis centers may be harmful to patients.\n        As Alex Berenson and Andrew Pollack laid bare in The Times on May 9, wide use of the medicines -- Aranesp and Epogen, from Amgen; and Procrit, from Johnson &amp; Johnson -- has been propelled by the two companies paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in so-called rebates. Doctors typically buy the drugs from the companies, get reimbursed for much of the cost by Medicare and private insurers, and on top of that get these rebates based on the amount they have purchased.\n        Although many doctors complain that they barely break even or even lose money on the costly drugs, for high-volume providers the profits can be substantial. One group of six cancer doctors in the Pacific Northwest earned a profit of about $1.8 million last year thanks to rebates from Amgen, while a large chain of dialysis centers gets an estimated 25 percent of its revenue, and a higher percentage of its profits, from the anemia drugs. It seems likely that these financial incentives have led to wider use and the prescribing of higher doses than medically desirable.\n        Although the drugs are deemed valuable in fighting severe anemia, there is scant evidence they help much in moderate cases and some evidence that high doses can be dangerous. Half of the dialysis patients in this country are now receiving enough of the drugs to raise their red blood cell counts to levels deemed risky by the Food and Drug Administration. And last week a panel of cancer experts urged the F.D.A. to impose additional restrictions on use of the drugs in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, based on studies that the drugs might make some cancers worse or hasten the deaths of patients.\n        Use of Procrit has also been fueled by television ads suggesting that it makes elderly cancer patients more energetic and, pushing all the emotional buttons, allows them to keep up with their grandchildren. That claim has not been established to the F.D.A.'s satisfaction, and a top official said last week that his agency owes the public a good explanation for why it allowed the ads to continue.\n        With any luck, the advisory panel's concerns should cause many oncologists to think twice before dispensing the anti-anemia drugs. But the surest way to slow the overprescribing is to stop the rebates. Federal laws already bar drug companies from paying doctors to prescribe medicines in pill form. That prohibition should be extended to injected and intravenous medicines.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1851741,"ids":1851741,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The failure of the Suffolk County Republican Party to put up its own candidate for county executive this year is an embarrassment for the G.O.P. and a triumph for the incumbent, Steve Levy, a Democrat who won the Republicans' cross-endorsement on May 24.\n        It is the first time one of the major parties has ever done that for a county executive race on Long Island.\n        One assumes that the Republicans' decision, mortifying as it was, would have been a lot harder if Mr. Levy had been a more distinctly different political animal from them. But Mr. Levy's brand of dogged populism, with its tough lines on taxes, spending and Latino immigrants, is intensely popular with white middle-class voters of both parties.\n        It has given him an aura of invincibility -- in Suffolk County, anyway -- and when county Republican leaders could not come up with someone, anyone, to be trampled by Mr. Levy in November, they bowed in humility before the county executive, who graciously accepted their tribute.\n        It was a proud moment for Mr. Levy, but it's too bad for voters, who deserved a choice this fall. Many Democrats and Republicans are impressed, and rightly so, with Mr. Levy's energy and public-spiritedness, but there are others who are put off by his stringent, Lou-Dobbsian views on immigration, his array of enforcement initiatives and restrictionist oratory that have worked to marginalize his critics, done little to discourage hate-mongers and stymied progress toward practical solutions to Suffolk's old, unresolved problems of day laborers and its simmering class and ethnic tensions.\n        Through smart governance and relentless attention to hot-button issues, Mr. Levy has made himself one of the most powerful leaders around, and all that power needs a counterweight -- particularly on the immigration issue, which has seen so much hostility vented locally upon the utterly powerless and poor. To stand up for them requires, in many cases, standing up to Mr. Levy, something few if any elected officials now seem willing or able to do.\n        Democrats may cheer at the spreading blueness of this formerly rock-ribbed-Republican island, with charismatic, pragmatic Democratic leaders running both counties and several of its sprawling towns. But a healthy political system requires opposition and dissent.\n        For now, the Democrats are the forces of change and renewal. But while it's possible for members of any party to don the garb of reformers, said garb has to be changed regularly or it begins to smell. The crumbling of Long Island's all-powerful and frequently corrupt Republican Party machinery is a good thing, but the vacuum that has replaced it is not.\n        Our wish is not for resurgent machines but for a healthy body politic, a living organism with sturdy parts made strong by the exercising of conflicting opinions and the toil of consensus-building. That's democracy, and it requires at least two functioning parties -- not one that works and another that's flat on its back.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1849934,"ids":1849934,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The federal budget for 2008, agreed to last week by the House and Senate, puts Congress in good shape to move forward responsibly on many of the nation's pressing needs. But the Bush administration seems determined to stand in the way.\n        The next step in the process is for Congress to pass 13 spending bills to allocate nearly $960 billion from the budget. The bills will fund activities that affect every American, including defense, diplomacy, education, environmental protection, food safety, homeland security, housing, infrastructure repair, local law enforcement, scientific research, transportation and veteran's health care.\n        But no sooner did Congress announce a budget agreement then the White House threatened to veto spending that exceeds levels suggested by President Bush last February. Mr. Bush only wants to increase funding for the Pentagon -- he requested $40 billion more than was granted this year. From everything else, he wants lawmakers to find a total of about $10 billion in cuts from this year's budget. Mr. Bush hasn't dictated what lawmakers must ax, but he has suggested cuts in education funding, which includes college aid and money for local school districts; in transportation, including money for mass transit; and in aid to cities.\n        Similar cuts proposed by Mr. Bush last year were considered so ill-advised that even the then-Republican majority could not muster enough votes to pass them.\n        In threatening to veto, the White House has tried to portray itself as fiscally prudent and Congress as spendthrift. The real difference is between an administration willing to starve basic government services -- in favor of tax cuts and financing a disastrous war -- and a Congress that is trying, within means, to run a responsive government.\n        In Congress's budget, lawmakers have agreed to give Mr. Bush every penny he requested for defense. And they have budgeted a relatively modest increase in nondefense spending of $13.5 billion over this year's level -- a 3.1 percent increase, after inflation. That's about one-tenth of the annual cost of the Iraq war or one-eighteenth of this year's cost for the Bush tax cuts. Even with that spending increase, nondefense appropriations would be lower in 2008, as a share of the economy, than in every year from 2001 through 2006.\n        Heeding the needs or the will of ordinary Americans has never been Mr. Bush's strong suit. On the 2008 budget, he should stop posturing and start working with lawmakers, for the good of his own legacy and for all the people who need the government's services and protections.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1754523,"ids":1754523,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The federal government has done such a miserable job of providing health insurance for the 46 million Americans who lack it that states around the country have been forced to step in with their own plans. The latest and boldest effort was signed into law this week in Massachusetts. It is a carefully crafted plan with elements that could serve as a model for elsewhere, provided Massachusetts finds sufficient funds to make it all work.\n        The cornerstone of the program is a requirement that everyone have a health insurance policy or pay a financial penalty. States have long required drivers to carry liability insurance, but this is the first time any state has imposed a health insurance mandate.\n        The move is already raising hackles among libertarians, who consider it an unwarranted government intrusion into decisions that should be personal. But the truth is, very few of the uninsured go entirely without medical care. When they get sick, they typically show up at emergency rooms, where they get very expensive care without paying.\n        By forcing all residents to assume responsibility for their own health coverage, Massachusetts should largely solve this ''free rider'' problem and tilt treatments back toward routine and preventive care and away from emergency care.\n        Of course, requiring people to get coverage doesn't mean much if they can't afford to buy it, so Massachusetts has come up with creative measures to make insurance accessible. There will be subsidies for low-income people. Insurers will be allowed to offer cheaper policies with fewer prescribed benefits for young adults. An innovative ''connector'' organization will serve as a marketplace where people can buy portable insurance with pretax dollars. Small employers can in essence designate the connector as their group health plan, easing their burden. The state's Medicaid enrollment will also be expanded.\n        The Massachusetts plan has unusually strong bipartisan support and includes elements drawn from both liberal and conservative playbooks. Although Mitt Romney, the Republican governor, has vetoed several elements of the plan, including a fee on businesses that refuse to participate, he is almost certain to be overridden by the overwhelmingly Democratic legislature.\n        Lots of details must still be worked out, and there are already concerns that the financial underpinnings of the plan are shaky. But Massachusetts deserves credit for tackling a problem that Washington is failing to address.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1756113,"ids":1756113,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The financial challenge of retirement is to make one's money last while paying health care costs that inevitably increase with age. It is becoming clear that to meet that challenge, many older Americans will need to cash in their home equity. In a report last year, the National Council on Aging, a research and advocacy organization, made a compelling case for expanding the use of specialized loans known as reverse mortgages to help older people pay for the care they need to remain safely at home, even as they become frailer.\n        The idea is to free up money to improve the quality of daily life, while delaying or averting the need for a nursing home. And since that should also be the nation's overall goal when it comes to the well-being of the elderly, reverse mortgages have to be regarded as a kind of social policy.\n        Reverse mortgages are loans that are made to retirees against a portion of their home equity. They require no monthly repayments. Unless a borrower chooses to repay sooner, the loan comes due, with interest, only when the house is sold -- such sales are often after the borrowers die. The sums are enormous: about 21 million homeowners are 62 or older and have an estimated $2 trillion in housing wealth. Nearly half of that could be tapped through reverse mortgages.\n        Yet despite an upsurge in reverse mortgages since 2000 -- to about 180,000 altogether -- the loans have never really caught on. They're readily available, mostly through the Federal Housing Administration. But the obstacles are daunting.\n        An F.H.A. mortgage requires a hefty insurance premium that protects the lender in case the value of the house declines. And planning for long-term care is something most Americans don't do because, as surveys show, they don't believe they'll ever need it. They should be so lucky. Only one-fourth of the homeowners 62 and older have no disabilities. The rest have limitations that range from relatively mild to severe conditions. More than one-third of the nation's old people fall each year, and of those, some 30 percent suffer injuries that make it difficult for them to remain at home.\n        Perhaps the biggest reason reverse mortgages aren't used more widely is the lack of a high-profile, concerted partnership among government, private and nonprofit sectors to promote them for what experts call ''aging in place.'' Some states have initiatives to link reverse mortgages and home-based care. But both the states and the federal government need to enact comprehensive incentives -- and consumer protections -- to encourage people to use reverse mortgages to pay for services that will allow them to grow old at home.\n        At their most basic, the inducements would involve waiving the upfront costs for people who use the loans to pay for health care. Perhaps the most powerful incentive would be to allow people who use reverse mortgages for home-based care to shield some assets from the Medicaid estate recovery process, which states use to recoup some of the money spent on Medicaid patients after the patients die.\n        Reverse mortgages are bound to become a social norm as the broad middle class of aging Americans begins to face a financial squeeze. The sooner there is debate, planning and action to link reverse mortgages to aging in place, the better the chances for an outcome that benefits the nation's elderly, and the nation at large.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1727837,"ids":1727837,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The first Constitution took for granted that enslaved people could not vote, but counted each slave as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of apportioning representation in Congress. This inflated the voting power of slaveholders and gave them much more influence in legislative matters than their actual numbers warranted. No American would knowingly tolerate such an arrangement today. But a glitch in the census that inflates the populations of some state legislative districts -- thus exaggerating their voting power -- has led to a contemporary version of that problem. It involves counting prison inmates in the district where they are confined rather than where they actually live. The Census Bureau could fix this problem in a heartbeat, so it needs to get a move on.\n        The culprit is a provision in the census that counts prison inmates as ''residents'' of the institutions where they are held, often for relatively short periods of time. Denied the right to vote in all but 2 of the 50 states, the inmates are nonetheless treated as voters when the State Legislatures draw up legislative districts. This practice mattered little 30 years ago, when the prison population was tiny. But with about 1.4 million people in prison today, it can be used to shift political power from one part of the state to another.\n        A startling analysis by Peter Wagner of the Prison Policy Initiative found seven upstate New York Senate districts meeting the population requirements only because inmates were included in the count. The Republican Party in New York relies on its large upstate delegation for its majority in the State Senate -- and for its political power statewide. New York is not alone. The Prison Policy Initiative's researchers found 21 counties nationally where at least 21 percent of so-called residents lived behind bars.\n        By counting these nonvoting inmates as residents, the prison counties offend the principle of one person one vote, while siphoning off political power from the home districts to which the inmates will return as soon as they are released. Since inmates are jobless, their presence also allows prison districts to lower their per capita incomes, unfairly increasing their share of federal funds earmarked for the poor. Congress, which has just caught on to this, recently gave the Census Bureau 90 days to file a report on the feasibility of counting inmates at their homes of record rather than in prison. At the same time, a committee overseen by the National Academy of Sciences has been studying the residency issue and is expected to make its final report this spring. But why does the bureau need another study to decide whether it wants to uphold the one-person-one-vote principle? The bureau should get to work immediately on procedures that would allow it to count inmates where they actually live -- and get those procedures locked in place by the 2010 census.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1748065,"ids":1748065,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The first episode of the new season of ''The Sopranos'' literally ended with a bang last week. Tony Soprano had a bullet in the belly, after being shot by his increasingly demented Uncle Junior, and the show's fans were left wondering if he would survive. The episode also featured a vicious mob beating, a snitch dropping dead in an F.B.I. agent's car, and a suicide by hanging. Season 6's dark and bloody premiere was a reminder of why ''The Sopranos'' is one of the most compelling television shows in a long time. But it also suggests why viewership may decline this year, as it seems to have done already.\n        The show's great appeal is that it takes the trials and tribulations of being a ruthless Mafia chieftain seriously. Tony's job heading New Jersey's leading crime organization is anything but glamorous. Usually it is one enormous headache. There are payoffs to be extorted, rival criminal organizations to compete with and enemies to be whacked. His mob underlings complain about their work, and botch assignments.\n        Tony's biggest troubles, though, have always been at home. He had the sort of father who would cut off a man's finger with a meat cleaver while his son was looking on. His mother once threatened to plunge a fork into his eye. His wife, Carmela, nearly divorced him; his sister is boiling over with resentment toward him; and his son is a constant disappointment. It made perfect sense that with his Mafia enemies and the F.B.I. circling, it was Tony's own uncle who brought him down last week.\n        It's no wonder that Tony spends so much time at the psychiatrist's office. His sessions with Dr. Jennifer Melfi are a highlight of the show. But what is striking about them, after five seasons, is how little progress Tony has made. This is not a crowd that has shown much capacity for growth. Last week's show provided an apt symbol: the suicide was of one of Tony's underlings who inherited $2 million and dreamed of escaping to Florida, only to be told that he would never be able to leave the mob.\n        This season's opener attracted 9.5 million viewers, down from the 12.1 million who watched the previous one. That may be due to the show's unusually long hiatus, and to competition from ABC's ''Desperate Housewives.'' But some viewers are no doubt turning away because they suspect that Tony's life story is not going to end happily, and they may be reluctant to watch the narrative arc of a character they have come to care about start pointing relentlessly downward. Tony could still have breakthroughs, in therapy and in life. But starting the season lying in a pool of his own blood, not knowing if help will arrive, he is certainly off to a bad start.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1722828,"ids":1722828,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The former members of the 9\/11 commission issued a report card yesterday that gives the federal government shockingly low grades on protecting the nation from another terrorist attack. These disastrous marks, which apply to both Congress and the Homeland Security Department, came at a crucial moment. Right now, Congress may be about to make more terrible decisions in two important areas: the homeland security financing formula and chemical plant security.\n        There can be little doubt that New York is at the top of Al Qaeda's target list -- unless, apparently, you are the Homeland Security Department and you are handing out port security money. In the most recent fiscal year, the department gave the port of New York and New Jersey just $6.6 million in port security grants, almost exactly what it gave to Memphis. Houston got $35.3 million, or more than five times as much.\n        On antiterrorism funds, experts uniformly agree that money should be allocated based on the risk of an attack and the risk of casualties.\n        But the Senate -- led by Susan Collins of Maine, the Republican chairwoman of the homeland security committee, and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat -- is fighting for a formula based not on risk, but on pork. Senator Collins's home state, and other rural states that face little threat, would get a pi\u00f1ata of new programs and equipment under the Senate formula. New York and California would get less money for vitally important programs.\n        The House has passed a formula pushed by two New York representatives -- John Sweeney, a Republican, and Nita Lowey, a Democrat -- that would put much more emphasis on risk-based allocation. The Senate and House will have to work out their differences, but so far the Senate is still holding out for its pork-based formula.\n        In its report card, the former 9\/11 commission, now known as the 9\/11 Public Discourse Project, gave the current financing formula an F, but said the grade would change to an A if the House provision was passed.\n        When it comes to failing performances, it's hard to match Congress's thoroughly irresponsible actions on securing chemical plants, where any terrorist attack could cause enormous casualties. To the delight of the chemical industry, a generous contributor to political campaigns, Congress has refused since Sept. 11 to impose reasonable safety standards. Now there is a real danger that Congress will do worse than nothing: it may pass a bill that actually weakens protections.\n        Congress is considering legislation that would invalidate state laws on chemical plant security. This comes just days after New Jersey, a major chemical manufacturing state, adopted mandatory plant security rules -- and shortly after Jon Corzine, a leading supporter of chemical plant safety measures, was elected governor.\n        It's hard to imagine that Washington will go to war against the states attempting to protect their residents from a potential toxic disaster. If that federal bill is passed, it will be strong evidence that Congress cares more about the chemical plant industry and its political clout than about ordinary Americans at risk in a terrorist attack.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1807114,"ids":1807114,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The front page of this newspaper's business section recently featured two articles about the world's most plentiful fuel, coal. Written from different parts of the globe, they framed the magnitude of the task confronting international negotiators and the newly empowered Democrats in Congress who want to put the brakes on emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas.\n        One article pointed out that China will surpass the United States as the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide by 2009, a decade ahead of previous predictions. A big reason is the explosion in the number of automobiles, but the main reason is China's ravenous appetite for coal, the dirtiest of all the fuels used to produce electricity. Already, China uses more coal than the United States, the European Union and Japan combined. Every week to 10 days, another coal-fired power plant opens somewhere in China, with enough capacity to serve all the households in Dallas or San Diego.\n        What's frightening about this for those worried about the long-term consequences of warming is that nearly all of these plants are being built along traditional lines, burning pulverized coal to make electricity. And what's sad about it is that there's a much cleaner coal-burning technology available. Known as I.G.C.C. -- for integrated gasification combined cycle -- this cleaner technology coverts coal into a gas before it is burned.\n        These plants produce fewer of the pollutants that cause smog and acid rain than conventional power plants do. More important, from a global warming perspective, they also have the potential to capture and sequester greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide before they enter the atmosphere.\n        This new technology is not readily available in China, but it is available to utilities in the United States. Which brings us to the second article -- an announcement by TXU, a giant Texas energy company, that it intends to build 11 new coal-fired power plants in Texas, plus another dozen or so coal-fired monsters elsewhere in the country. All told, this would be the nation's largest single coal-oriented construction campaign in years.\n        Is TXU availing itself of the cleaner technology? No. TXU will use the old pulverized coal model. The company says the older models are more reliable. But the real reason it likes the older models is that they are easier to build, cheaper to run and, ultimately, much more profitable. So, like the Chinese, TXU is locking itself (and the country) into at least 50 more years of the most carbon-intensive technology around.\n        Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who will shortly assume command of the Senate environment committee, believes that we should impose a price on carbon emissions (as Europe has done) so that companies like TXU will begin to think about investing in cleaner technologies -- technologies that China could then use in its power plants. The message from both Texas and China is that Ms. Boxer should get cracking.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1851807,"ids":1851807,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The good news is that the New Jersey Legislature finally seems about to end the practice of holding more than one elective office at a time. The bad news is that legislators will do it with the hypocrisy that New Jerseyans have come to expect of them.\n        Senate Democrats, who have been distinctly cool to the idea of eliminating dual office holding, agreed last month to a ban -- but with a disturbing qualification. The prohibition would not take effect until February, after this year's election, in which all 120 seats in the Legislature are at stake. Any legislators holding two offices at that time would be allowed to keep both jobs until they were voted out of one of them.\n        Why is it defensible for someone elected before next February to hold two elective offices, and it is not for those newly elected after that? Only a legislator would even try to answer that question.\n        The Senate's agreement to the qualified ban comes after a long tug-of-war between Gov. Jon Corzine, who views dual office holding as part of New Jersey's ethically challenged mosaic, and many legislators, 19 of whom also hold elective office at the county or municipal level. Three of these legislators are not seeking re-election, but the others are.\n        The arguments against the practice seem obvious to almost anyone not benefiting from it.

And then there's the adage that no one can serve two masters, at least not when their interests are in conflict, which is not unusual. Take, for example, a mayor who is also a senator. What is this official to do if a state aid proposal is generous to the mayor's town at the expense of many other communities in the district? Most state constitutions ban the practice outright; New Jersey has more dual office holders than any other state.\n        Sadly, the qualified ban is probably the best New Jersey voters can hope for, and in time it will eliminate the practice completely. For now, however, it will allow State Senator Nicholas Sacco, a Hudson County Democrat and poster boy for dual (in his case triple) office holding, to continue business as usual as long as he is re-elected. Mr. Sacco was just sworn into a new term as mayor of North Bergen, where he is also assistant school superintendent.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1726728,"ids":1726728,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The good, the bad and the ugly were on display yesterday in the Senate's mad dash toward recess. Ugliest of all was a 51-to-50 vote approving unfair budget cutbacks that would burden the poor with Medicaid, child-support and workfare restrictions. Vice President Dick Cheney rushed to the Capitol to cast the tie-breaking vote for what amounts to a $39.7 billion smokescreen for the Republicans' plan to sneak back into town after the holidays and pass up to $100 billion in tax cuts favoring the affluent.\n        The Senate showed some steel in turning back an underhanded attempt to attach oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to the spending bill for Iraq. Opponents of this cynical attempt to exploit American soldiers won in a vote that provided a rare, hopeful moment for those who yearn for the Senate to show some independence from the administration's legislative wish list.\n        But even as the drilling ploy of Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska was rebuffed, President Bush was employing a yet more apocalyptic argument to press the Senate to renew the Patriot Act and override concerns about the law's impinging on the privacy rights of ordinary Americans. ''The expiration of this vital law will endanger America,'' Mr. Bush said, never mentioning that he had rebuffed a reasonable bipartisan plan to extend the law for three months so more credible civil liberties safeguards could be written. Late yesterday, the Senate agreed on a six-month extension, and a White House official said the president would accept such a offer. But the House will still need to act.\n        The pause over the Patriot Act and privacy rights is ever more necessary as revelations continue about the president's secret program to permit the surveillance of Americans beyond the clear limits of existing law. A federal judge has resigned from the court that oversees intelligence cases, a step that was reported to be in protest of Mr. Bush's decision to bypass the court and permit eavesdropping without warrants.\n        Mr. Bush's latest overheated warning that a wall would go up between intelligence agents and criminal investigators if the Patriot Act expired was echoed by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales at a news conference. Mr. Gonzales pointedly ducked a question raised by Senate critics: why would the expiration of the Patriot Act on Dec. 31 present such a problem for an administration that feels so free to expand its powers in private?","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1752831,"ids":1752831,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The governors of New York and New Jersey and the mayor of New York City finally sat down face to face on Wednesday to talk about the problems at the World Trade Center site.

In recent weeks, Govs. George Pataki and Jon Corzine and Mayor Michael Bloomberg have each been pulling in a different direction, the perfect way to go nowhere.\n        Mr. Bloomberg, who argues for more residential space in the area, wants to drastically cut back the developer Larry Silverstein's control over the site. Meanwhile, timing is crucial for Mr. Pataki, who is leaving office at the end of the year. Before he goes, he wants a real groundbreaking for the Freedom Tower. And the newcomer to the debate, Mr. Corzine, is said to be focusing on a better deal for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in its protracted negotiations with Mr. Silverstein.\n        Now that all three politicians are at the same table, there certainly should be ways to resolve these differences. Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Corzine are former business executives, which should only help the authority in its negotiations with the site's developer. They should make certain that Mr. Silverstein and the authority provide enough support and infrastructure to build the public space -- the Sept. 11 memorial -- as soon as possible.\n        As for Mr. Bloomberg's pitch that this area should go more residential, Lower Manhattan would be served best by a vibrant mix of commercial, retail and residential space to bolster the financial community near Wall Street, but also by expanding it into a 24-hour neighborhood.\n        Finally, Mr. Pataki's Freedom Tower seems in danger of evolving into a white elephant that nobody wants to lease, instead of a grand symbol of ground zero's rebirth. The departing governor of New York would be better off hitching his legacy to the memorial, a powerful design that would serve as the centerpiece to the entire site.\n        There should be more ground zero summits soon. If these three public servants can start singing in something close to harmony, then we can start hoping -- again -- that a deal will end negotiations with Mr. Silverstein and start the rebuilding.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1850693,"ids":1850693,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The great immigration struggle of 2007 has moved from the Senate chamber in Washington to the continent at large. With Congress taking the week off, it's time for constituents to weigh in. You can be sure of this much: The debate will get louder before it gets better.\n        The problems with the restrictionist provisions of the Senate immigration bill are serious and many. It includes a path to citizenship for 12 million illegal immigrants, which is a rare triumph for common sense, but that path is strewn with cruel conditions, including a fine -- $5,000 -- that's too steep and hurdles that are needlessly high, including a ''touchback'' requirement for immigrants to make pilgrimages to their home countries to cleanse themselves of illegality. The bill imposes an untested merit-point system that narrows the channels through which family members can immigrate.\n        And it calls for hundreds of thousands of guest workers to toil here temporarily in an absurd employment hokey-pokey -- you put your two years in, then one year out, then repeat that twice and go home forever. It would be massive indentured servitude -- colonial times all over again, but without any hope of citizenship for those taking our most difficult and despised jobs.\n        Those who want this bill to be better are horribly conflicted by it. Their emotions still seem vastly overmatched by the ferocity of the opposition from the restrictionist right, with talk radio lighting up over ''amnesty,'' callers spitting out the words with all the hate they can pour into it.\n        It is encouraging that the bill survived several attempts by that camp to blow it apart, including an amendment that would have stricken the legalization section outright. The center held last week. But it will take a real effort to make the Senate bill much better, given that a core group of senators are bound to the ungainly architecture of their ''grand bargain'' and that any progress in significantly altering or improving it could unravel the deal.\n        The Senate bill is repellent in many ways. Its fragrant blossoms are grafted to poisonous roots. But it is also bipartisan, and there lies the kernel of possibility that may ultimately redeem it. A good bill may yet emerge if enough lawmakers -- with encouragement from the White House and Americans at large, whose moderate views on immigration were reflected in a New York Times\/CBS News poll published on Friday -- realize that striking hard-line poses matters less than drafting legislation marrying reality, justice and decency. Advocates of comprehensive immigration reform -- which this bill is not -- should not give up the fight.\n        Americans, meanwhile, should look closely at what they have been offered, and to imagine what a strange country this would be if the bill passed as is, if it morphs into a harsher one, or if it is shot down and we are left with the dismal status quo. We would rattle around in our fortified chunk of North America, bristling at our southern border -- nothing is stopping that process -- as we check our turnstiles carefully for those bright enough to merit entry, bask in the labor of a churning class of serfs, check people's ID's, raid workplaces and fill our detention centers.

It now appears that someone in a Republican Congressional campaign conjured a contemporary spin on a classic scare tactic from torchlight politics.\n        Comparable outrages surface daily now, with an ad for black voters in six states misrepresenting the Rev.

''You know he was a Republican,'' the other chimes in.\n        Democrats are no less tempted to flash bare-knuckle mischief. In a prime example, Representative Nancy Johnson, a Connecticut Republican, is being portrayed by Chris Murphy, the Democrat, as heartlessly unresponsive to a woman whose child needed insurance coverage for a cleft lip and palate. Of course, Ms. Johnson has represented Mr. Murphy as being opposed to the surveillance of terrorists.\n        So it goes, with some ethically challenged spinners creating false news clippings and tucking them knifelike into campaign videos of real stories. Even Lincoln is being falsely quoted by defenders of the Iraq war. The 16th president never said that Congressional critics who damage wartime morale ''should be arrested, exiled or hanged.''\n        One of the more widespread canards is rooted in the divisive and fruitless immigration debate. Democrats in more than two dozen races are being falsely accused of wanting to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants -- a distortion of a proposal to actually block immigrants from being credited for benefit days worked before they had legal status.

Many of its hard-line foes are celebrating, but their glee is vindictive and hollow. They have blocked one avenue to an immigration overhaul while offering nothing better, thwarting bipartisanship to satisfy their reflexive loathing for amnesty, which they define as anything that helps illegal immigrants get right with the law.\n        The tragedy is that the compromise bill was written to bring these restrictionists along, with punitive, detestable provisions that many supporters of comprehensive reform agreed to endorse for the sake of a ''grand bargain.'' The bill was badly flawed but fixable, as long as there was the possibility of leadership and courage in Congress.\n        But obstruction happened. Republican amendments, designed to shred the compromise, happened.\n        Jeff Sessions wanted to deprive legalized immigrants -- yes, legal residents -- of the earned income tax credit, a path out of poverty for millions.\n        John Cornyn wanted to strip confidentiality protections for immigrants who apply for legal status, making them too frightened to leave the shadows.\n        Jim DeMint just wanted to kill the bill, so he voted for a volatile amendment whose substance he disagreed with. ''If it hurts the bill, I'm for it,'' he said.\n        Leadership was desperately needed to stop Republicans from dragging the bill off one of its pillars -- the one that would put 12 million people on a path to legal status. It didn't show up. Republicans who should have been holding their party and the deal together -- President Bush, minority leader Mitch McConnell, Senator John Kyl -- failed utterly.\n        The anti-immigrant hard-core -- no amnesty today, no amnesty tomorrow, no amnesty ever -- must not be allowed to hold the nation hostage. Like nativists of generations past, they think the country is being Latinized, and they fear it. The country is changing, but the way it always has, absorbing newcomers, shaping and being shaped by them, inexorably turning them, their children and grandchildren into Americans. Globalization has accelerated and complicated that upheaval, and decades of federal dithering have made things messy and chaotic.\n        Restoring order will be wrenchingly difficult, but it must be done. The country cannot leave an unlawful, chaotic system to fester, with legal immigration channels clogged, families split apart, crops rotting and state and local governments dreaming up ways to punish 12 million people whose identities are unknown to the authorities, and who aren't leaving, no matter what Congress does. We cannot simply fortify a wall while continuing to extract cheap labor from cowering workers who risk death to get here. Inaction on immigration carries a brutally high price, but those on the phobic right are willing to mortgage their country's future to pay it.\n        A core group of lawmakers has shown a greater faith in their country than that.

By a vote of 63 to 34, the Senate tacked onto its immigration bill an amendment from Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma that declares English to be ''the national language of the United States.'' If you thought otherwise, or weren't sure, well, now you know: We speak English here. None of that ''Oprima n\u00famero dos.''\n        If the amendment merely stated the achingly obvious, it might be nothing to get upset about. Senator Ken Salazar, Democrat of Colorado, offered an amendment asserting, nonbindingly, that English is the language that unites us all. That one was passed, too. But Mr. Inhofe and his allies weren't looking to make a statement about our shared heritage.\n        They made another point -- one that is exclusionary, potentially discriminatory and embarrassingly hostile to the rest of the world.\n        ''Unless otherwise authorized or provided by law,'' the Inhofe amendment says, ''no person has a right, entitlement or claim to have the government of the United States or any of its officials or representatives act, communicate, perform or provide services, or provide materials in any language other than English.'' It goes on to insist that new citizens be tested for knowledge of English and of certain pillars of American civics, like the Federalist Papers and ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''\n        People who struggle with the language don't need to be told how important English fluency is in America. If Mr. Inhofe wanted to lavish federal money on English-language classes, now overwhelmed with immigrants on waiting lists, such a step would do more to advance the cause of English and assimilation than any xenophobic amendment.\n        Mr. Inhofe flubbed the national anthem a little in the Senate debate (it's ''our flag'' that was still there, not ''the flag''). And he would have done well to require knowledge of other important aspects of American history, too, like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the anti-Catholic Know-Nothing movement and the Ku Klux Klan.\n        This country has always come to regret official actions that exclude and alienate large populations of newcomers.

But there is a much larger issue than the question of what administration officials said about Iraq after the invasion -- it's what they said about Iraq before the invasion. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, may have been grandstanding yesterday when he forced the Senate to hold a closed session on the Iraqi intelligence, but at least he gave the issue a much-needed push.\n        President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell and George Tenet, to name a few leading figures, built support for the war by telling the world that Saddam Hussein was stockpiling chemical weapons, feverishly developing germ warfare devices and racing to build a nuclear bomb. Some of them, notably Mr. Cheney, the administration's doomsayer in chief, said Iraq had conspired with Al Qaeda and implied that Saddam Hussein was connected to 9\/11.\n        Last year, the Senate Intelligence Committee did a good bipartisan job of explaining that the intelligence in general was dubious, old and even faked by foreign sources. The panel said the analysts had suffered from groupthink. At the time, the highest-ranking officials in Washington were demanding evidence against Iraq.\n        But that left this question: If the intelligence was so bad and so moldy, why was it presented to the world as what Mr. Tenet, then the director of central intelligence, famously called ''a slam-dunk'' case?\n        Were officials fooled by bad intelligence, or knowingly hyping it? Certainly, the administration erased caveats, dissents and doubts from the intelligence reports before showing them to the public. And there was never credible intelligence about a working relationship between Iraq and Al Qaeda.\n        Under a political deal that Democrats should not have approved, the Intelligence Committee promised to address these questions after the 2004 election. But a year later, there is no sign that this promise is being kept, other than unconvincing assurances from Senator Pat Roberts, the Republican who is chairman of the intelligence panel, that people are working on it.\n        So far, however, there has been only one uncirculated draft report by one committee staff member on the narrow question of why the analysts didn't predict the ferocity of the insurgency. The Republicans have not even agreed to do a final report on the conflict between the intelligence and the administration's public statements.\n        Mr. Reid wrested a commitment from the Senate to have a bipartisan committee report by Nov. 14 on when the investigation will be done. We hope Mr. Roberts now gives this half of the investigation the same urgency he gave the first half and meets his commitment to examine all aspects of this mess, including how the information was used by the administration.

The presence on the Capitol steps of Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton underscored that, as did the bipartisan phalanx of dignitaries. From the solemn oath-taking to the seemingly endless parade of marching bands from red states and blue, everything underscored the message of legitimacy and acceptance.\n        The victors had plenty of time, starting with the exclusive, high-roller parties last night, to bask in triumph. If the inauguration itself works as it's supposed to work, the most important participants are the Americans who did not vote for the man who's being sworn in. They're called upon to acknowledge the chief executive, and at least come to terms with the process that got him there. The president is expected to deliver an address that emphasizes the basic principles that unite the country.\n        On that count, George W. Bush did his job. ''Across the generations,'' he said, ''we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave.'' He echoed presidents of both parties when he called upon a new generation to ''make the choice to serve a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself.''\n        The moment of national unity isn't meant to be very long, and before the last precision drill squad had passed the presidential viewing stand on Pennsylvania Avenue, Democrats were pointing out that Mr. Bush glossed over the mess in Iraq, dodged specifics about his agenda and gave little indication of how exactly he intended to carry out that promise to try to heal the nation's political divisions.\n        All that is certainly true, but it missed the point of Mr. Bush's role, which was to summon the generalities that unite us. The rest should wait for another day; our least favorite parts of the speech, in fact, were those that tended toward the specific, like the barely hidden commercial for the president's plan to privatize parts of Social Security. Mr. Bush's declarations about promoting global democracy ring true as a statement of American ideals, not as a claim for the legitimacy of any particular policies.\n        Once in a long while, a newly sworn-in president moves beyond the deeply felt but slightly bland oratory and says something that people will repeat long after he has moved into history.

At a time when high administration officials routinely dissemble and claim lapses of memory, immediate jail time for Mr. Libby, a convicted felon, is the best way to send a message that obstruction of justice will be severely punished.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1848692,"ids":1848692,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The job of acquiring New Jersey's few remaining acres of undeveloped land cannot wait until Trenton straightens out the state's fiscal mess. That is why it is urgent that the Legislature authorize a voter referendum to continue a successful 10-year-old program begun in the Whitman administration to protect open land from development.\n        Anyone who has driven the state's back roads and seen the proliferation of new housing needs no reminding that there is little undeveloped land left. Recent studies indicate that at the present rate of development the state could run out of any land suitable for preservation in less than 40 years.\n        A measure before the Legislature would ask voters whether they wish to allocate $175 million a year for the next 10 years to continue a bonding program for financing the Garden State Preservation Trust. The money, which would also allow the state to buy homes in flood plains, would come from the state's growing sales tax revenues.\n        The measure must be approved by both the State Senate and the Assembly before they recess for the summer if it is to appear on the ballot this November. Left to their own devices, legislators would probably pass the measure overwhelmingly since the land purchase program has consistently won popular support from New Jersey voters.\n        But Gov. Jon Corzine has raised an objection, which on the surface seems persuasive. He wants to postpone action until his forthcoming plan is enacted to straighten out the state's finances, probably by leasing major assets like the turnpike. Mr.Corzine would use the popular land purchase funding as a sweetener to entice reluctant legislators to support the controversial leasing program.\n        The problem is that no one knows how long it will take Mr. Corzine to win approval of his leasing program, which has not even been officially proposed. Unless the open space funding goes to voters this fall, the program could be delayed for a year or two or more. Meanwhile, the program is running dry and, unless it is replenished, developers will continue gobbling up valuable land. The administration has offered stopgap funding but it isn't enough.\n        Ironically, the prospect of an interruption in the land purchasing program comes at a particularly advantageous moment to buy open space. Because of the housing slump, conservationists say, developers are more amenable than before to accepting reasonable prices from public entities interested in buying land solely to preserve it.\n        When the housing slump ends, as all economists believe it will, the price of land will rise, and New Jersey once again will have lost an opportunity to preserve land at an affordable price. It should also be kept in mind that the $175 million a year price tag for the land acquisition proposal is a pittance in comparison to Mr. Corzine's proposed $33.3 billion state budget.\n        For all these reasons, the Legislature must approve this land acquisition measure before recessing for the summer. When it comes to preserving open land in this most developed state in the nation, there will be no tomorrow.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1707578,"ids":1707578,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The job of chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is one of the biggest and most important in Washington, and given President Bush's record of appointing his pals to fill every position from Supreme Court justice to director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, it's small wonder that there is a lot of fretting over who will be tapped to succeed Alan Greenspan.\n        During his news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Bush made reassuring noises aimed at global markets. ''It's important that whomever I pick is viewed as an independent person from politics,'' the president said. ''It's this independence of the Fed that gives people not only here in America, but the world, confidence.''\n        Sounds great. But this is also the same man who said during that same news conference that he believes that Harriet Miers, his onetime personal lawyer and present White House counsel, who has never been a judge, is the most qualified of all the people in the United States to be a Supreme Court justice. The president's aides have made it clear that he wants someone at the Fed with whom he can have a rapport. That should be the last thing on the president's mind for this job, but we know from bitter experience that Mr. Bush often places feeling comfortable with an appointee above actual competence. It's just that kind of thinking that landed America with Michael Brown at FEMA and John Snow at the Treasury Department.\n        Mr. Snow's lackluster tenure at the Treasury, in particular, says a lot about Mr. Bush's detachment from economic policy. The hapless Mr. Snow, who thankfully is on no one's list for Fed chairman, remains completely removed from any real policy making within the administration. His biggest role at the Treasury has been as cheerleader for Mr. Bush's tax cuts and salesman for his misbegotten plan to privatize Social Security.\n        The four names circulating around Washington are Martin Feldstein, a Bush adviser on Social Security and an economics professor at Harvard; Glenn Hubbard, Mr. Bush's former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and now dean of Columbia University Business School; Lawrence Lindsey, the former director of the White House National Economic Council; and Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.\n        Two of them -- Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Feldstein -- come with some independent credentials. Mr. Bernanke is deeply conservative, economists say, but respected for independent thinking and not inclined to wear that conservatism on his sleeve. Mr. Feldstein has pushed for Social Security privatization, but in the past criticized deficits run up by Ronald Reagan, for whom he was working at the time, to the everlasting ire of many Republicans. That hardly makes him a shoo-in for the job, but those are exactly the independent traits that Mr. Bush should be looking for if he is indeed serious about appointing a Fed chairman who isn't politically beholden to the White House.\n        Hopes die hard, so we strongly encourage Mr. Bush to put his money where his mouth is this time around.

If most of them do, the two parties' nominations could be locked up by next February. Rich Bond, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, got it right recently when he told The Boston Globe that this megaprimary would be ''a de facto national primary,'' which would be ''insane.''\n        One coast-to-coast whopper of a primary would probably be a boon for the candidates with the most money and the highest name recognition. Fresher faces, and those without big bankrolls and well-oiled machines, would have to struggle to compete in so many delegate-rich early primaries at once. The biggest losers, though, would be the voters, who would be deprived of the chance to evaluate the candidates over the course of a primary season.\n        What is needed here is a little order from the leaders of the Democratic and Republican Parties. Their job should be to maintain the primaries as a way for voters to take the real live measure of their candidates. Ideally, the national parties should press for regional primaries that rotate every presidential election year so the primary season is maintained, but voters in every state have a chance at some point to be first in the nation.\n        Without that leadership, the states are making their own plans. In the next few weeks, legislatures in New York and New Jersey are expected to consider moving their primaries to Feb. 5. Those in favor of what is being called Super-Sized Tuesday argue that this change would force candidates to talk more about issues that affect the metropolitan area. That might be true.

George Pataki to sign includes one that is critically important for the Hudson Valley: legislation to increase state aid to the Westchester Medical Center by $75 million over three years. Mr. Pataki should sign it.\n        When the bill, sponsored by Nicholas Spano in the Senate and Richard Brodsky in the Assembly, passed the Legislature, it was one of the last steps in a long process of pulling the hospital out of its dreadful financial straits and putting it on a sound footing for the future. That the hospital needed to be saved was never in dispute; as the only tertiary-care hospital between New York City and Albany, it provides vital services to people in seven counties, far beyond its home in Valhalla, in northern Westchester. And as a quasi-public entity, it is the hospital of last resort for the poor. It could not be allowed to fail.\n        For a long time as the hospital foundered, it was possible for critics to fire off salvos of blame in any direction -- they would always hit something. Much of the scorn had to do with inept and overreaching management. When the hospital ceased being a branch of Westchester government and became a public-benefit corporation in 1996, it took the inefficiency and bad habits of a county agency into the cutthroat private medical marketplace. A lax board and reckless management team conspired to spend lavishly on trips, acquisitions, expansion projects and consultants as costs and debt spiraled. Westchester County and New York State, meanwhile, shared blame for chronically underfinancing a hospital that they should have known would never be able to compete with the private medical palaces of Manhattan.\n        As the budget crises became chronic and more severe, finger-pointing led to political scrambling, and the pieces of a solution began to fall into place. A new management team has cut costs, wrung concessions from unions and upgraded administrative procedures and technology. The county has stepped up with more money, including a $56 million one-shot infusion from a tobacco lawsuit settlement and $14.5 million or more a year for unreimbursed expenses it won't collect from the hospital, for utilities, security and groundskeeping.\n        Even without counting the county support, the hospital has moved sharply to right itself. A $103 million deficit in 2003 fell to $32 million this year, and the hospital expects to essentially break even next year. It has also tightened internal controls to add layers of oversight, addressing Mr. Pataki's concerns about sending new state aid to what had been a loosely governed hospital.\n        The state aid package -- an increase in Medicaid reimbursement rates -- is an improvement on the sales-tax schemes that were floated last year by the supporters of a hospital bailout. But the word in Albany is that lawmakers on Long Island, concerned for the health of their own deeply troubled public-benefit hospital, Nassau University Medical Center, have urged Mr. Pataki to veto the Westchester bill, which has nothing in it for Nassau.\n        The aging, ailing and deficit-ridden Nassau hospital has its own set of problems that the county and a management team have been struggling to overcome. But those troubles should not be allowed to get in the way of the Spano-Brodsky bill, which offers the solid possibility that Westchester's most problematic hospital won't be a problem any more.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1669851,"ids":1669851,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The last thing Americans need is public broadcasting where the politics of the moment limits the news of the day. Yet that could be where the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is heading if Kenneth Tomlinson, the chairman, keeps pushing for partisan Republicans in the management of public television and radio.\n        Mr. Tomlinson, a former editor in chief of Reader's Digest, has repeatedly criticized PBS as too liberal over all and has said that his goal is to satisfy a broader constituency. Satisfying more people with public television and radio is a worthy aim, but several recent surveys for public broadcasting have shown that most viewers and listeners admire what's on now. More than half of PBS's viewers say they find its news more ''trustworthy'' than the commercial stations'. Public television and radio programs like ''Frontline,'' ''The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' and ''All Things Considered'' have even higher ''favorable'' ratings.\n        There was a time when a passionate conservative might have looked at PBS programming and called it too liberal. But those days seem long past. And in any case, as an article in The Times this week showed, Mr. Tomlinson's goal of expanding the audience for PBS does not include bolstering PBS's balance with centrist programming. It involves pushing public broadcasting over the ideological line to the Republican side, with blatantly partisan programming and the hiring of more Republican partisans to control the corporation.\n        Mr. Tomlinson seems to have aimed primarily at the program ''Now With Bill Moyers,'' which he found too liberal and ''populist.'' As a result, he pushed for a new conservative talk show featuring right-leaning editorialists from The Wall Street Journal as ''balance.'' Many stations now take both shows, even though Mr. Moyers has left ''Now,'' which features investigative journalism, and The Journal's show is not too different from many offerings on cable news.\n        Mr. Tomlinson has hired a staff member from the Bush White House to set up guidelines for the ombudsmen hired to critique shows on public broadcasting. And he is trying to hire a State Department official, a former co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's president and chief executive.\n        Although he has insisted that he does not want to politicize PBS or cut any programs, Mr. Tomlinson has managed to spread the word throughout the PBS community that he does not like anything that he considers too anti-corporate, anti-White House or anti-Republican. For journalists whose basic code is to ''speak truth to power,'' this is not good news: those are the main powers in the country.\n        Their real fear, an understandable one at this stage, is that Mr. Tomlinson and his supporters have a larger agenda -- to ''hollow out'' public broadcasting and fill it with programming that suits their political agenda. And if public broadcasting becomes too political to suit all but the most loyal Republicans or too boring in the name of balance, that could mean the slow death of such broadcasting, which could have been the goal all along.\n        Unlike such organizations as the Voice of America, where Mr. Tomlinson once worked, public broadcasting is not supposed to be an arm of the government. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was designed to serve as a heat shield protecting the broadcasting wing from Washington's political friction. Instead of shielding PBS, Mr. Tomlinson's corporation is in danger of spreading today's political heat throughout every level of the network.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1648292,"ids":1648292,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The last thing Mayor Michael Bloomberg needs, with a re-election battle looming, is a big controversy over gay marriage. But that is what a state court judge handed him last week by ruling that gay marriage is legal in New York City and pointing out the serious injustice of denying gay men and women the right to marry. The mayor announced his intention to appeal, while at the same time expressing his personal support for gay marriage. His stance has brought considerable criticism from gay New Yorkers, from political opponents and from people who simply say Mr. Bloomberg is trying to have it both ways. Nevertheless, he made the right decision.\n        New York does not have a residency requirement for marriage, so if last week's ruling had not been quickly appealed, gay couples from all over the nation would have flocked to the city. But there is a genuine question about what the law in New York State currently is. Although one city judge has now ruled in favor of gay marriage, courts upstate have ruled the other way. Rather than creating more legal confusion, Mr. Bloomberg wisely chose to hold off granting licenses while pushing for an expedited hearing from the state's highest court.\n        Gay couples should be free to marry, but marriage is an important enough institution that all of society has an interest in defining it carefully. One lower court judge -- or one small-town mayor, as in the case of New Paltz, N.Y., last year -- cannot single-handedly rewrite a state's marriage law. And gay couples should not be lured to New York City to have weddings that could turn out to have no legal standing.\n        Mr. Bloomberg could not, of course, have missed the political dangers on both sides of the issue. If he had accepted the local judge's ruling, he would have risked alienating conservatives whose votes he may need next year, particularly if he faces a primary challenge. If he appealed the ruling too enthusiastically, he would offend gays and their supporters, whose votes could prove pivotal in the general election.\n        It is easy to dismiss as insignificant the mayor's announcement that he supports gay marriage -- coming in tandem, as it did, with the appeal. But it could carry weight in the State Legislature, which, ideally, will make the decision to allow gay marriage, or in the courts. If the Court of Appeals takes up the issue, a key legal question will be whether the state has a legitimate reason for denying gay couples the freedom to marry. Having the mayor of the state's largest city stand up as Mr. Bloomberg did should be powerful evidence that it does not.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1771677,"ids":1771677,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The last thing New York's Legislature deserves right now is a pay raise. The people who do deserve a raise are the state's judges. When voters go to the polls this fall, they should ask their legislators why the judges' salaries have not been increased. And they should make them promise not to slip in an undeserved increase for themselves after the election is over.\n        It pains us to be so cranky on this issue. In general, we have always believed that if the public wants quality legislators, it should be willing to pay for them. Currently, members make a base salary of $79,500 a year. Some of them take their responsibilities in Albany seriously and put in long hours on constituent services back home. They are worth more. But they are not the norm.\n        Being a New York State legislator is officially a part-time job. Many members have careers that benefit enormously from the contacts they acquire in Albany. They get added benefits for running a committee, per diem allotments and travel money. They also have plenty of free time to hold campaign fund-raisers, whose proceeds can be used for anything from country club dues to cat litter.\n        Right now New York legislators are officially the fourth highest paid in the country, behind those of California, Michigan and the District of Columbia. And that is not counting the extras, or the campaign committees that turn into convenient slush pits. But whether it's the best paid or the fourth best paid, New York's Legislature is not the best or the fourth best in quality. It is below average and most definitely not worth more money.\n        Other regional legislatures are cheap by comparison. New Jersey's lawmakers earn $49,000, Connecticut's only $28,000. And while neither legislature recalls the golden age of Athens, given the price tag we would say that New Jersey and Connecticut residents are getting more for their money.\n        Before countenancing increases, New York voters should require legislators to fix their ethics rules, make the job full time or, failing that, prohibit lawmakers from serving on committees that deal with issues to which they have a professional connection. There should also be a nonpartisan committee to fix legislative district boundaries, so elections really confer a mandate from the people.\n        New York's chief judge, Judith Kaye, has proposed what seems a progressive and reasonable alternative. Her suggestion is that every four years the state should create a temporary commission on pay raises for state executive, judicial and legislative officials. That would be a good answer for the judiciary.

It would be rash to make definitive judgments until the F.D.A. completes a detailed analysis. But the handling of this case bears disturbing resemblances to the Vioxx debacle, in which early warning signs were ignored by its manufacturer until the evidence of serious harm became inescapable and the drug was pulled from the market.\n        Avandia was approved for sale in 1999 based on studies showing that it could lower blood glucose levels in patients suffering from Type 2 diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes. The assumption was that the drug could alleviate some of the most damaging effects of the disease, such as heart attacks and other cardiovascular ailments. But a paper just published in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests that Avandia may instead increase the risk of a heart attack by 43 percent and perhaps the risk of cardiovascular deaths as well.\n        The study -- an analysis of the combined results of 42 previous studies that compared people who took the drug with people who did not -- is not definitive, and the absolute risk to any given patient is small. But the study points to a risk that could potentially harm thousands of patients a year. Its lead author was Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, who blew the whistle on the cardiovascular risks of Vioxx, which adds to the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n        What's most troubling is the possibility that early warning signs were not adequately heeded.\n        Seven years ago a leading diabetes doctor warned the F.D.A. of ''a worrisome trend in cardiovascular deaths,'' two years later a safety monitoring group within the agency expressed concern over cases of heart failure in patients taking the drug. In late 2005 and again in August 2006 the drug's manufacturer -- GlaxoSmithKline -- informed the F.D.A. that its own combined analysis of various studies showed a 31 percent increase in adverse cardiovascular events. But the company also cited studies that it said showed no evidence of harm, and the F.D.A. concluded the findings were too mixed to take immediate regulatory action.\n        Now, prodded by Dr. Nissen's article, the agency has issued a safety alert, is completing its own safety analysis and will convene a panel of experts to review the data. The best hope for a definitive answer may lie in a clinical trial that won't finish monitoring all enrolled patients until late next year.\n        If the verdict goes against Avandia, the F.D.A. and Glaxo will have a lot to explain. Congress will need to probe hard to determine what risks the agency and the manufacturer were aware of and what they did -- or didn't do -- to mitigate them.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":4,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1802029,"ids":1802029,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The latest information about the economy leaves no question that it has slowed down by just about every measure -- housing and manufacturing, retail sales and job growth, and others.\n        Even the recent increase in compensation is generally believed to be a sign of coming layoffs, not a harbinger of wage inflation. When business dries up at firms and factories, employers don't cut back immediately. So for a time, pay and benefits hang in there. As for the recent improvement in the unemployment rate, sorry to say, it's an aberration. The job market won't turn up in any meaningful way when the overall direction of the economy is down.\n        All of this information has fed the debate on the dominant economic question of the day: Is the United States economy headed toward the longed-for soft landing, in which it cools without contracting. Or is another recession inevitable? It's an interesting question, but in many ways it also is a diversion.\n        Most Americans are ill prepared for an economic deceleration, even if it ends in a soft landing. When economic basics like income and insurance coverage are taken into account, most working families are no better off now than they were when the economic expansion began in late 2001.\n        They have been held back, primarily, by lousy pay. In 26 of the past 30 months, wages for most of the work force have failed to outpace inflation, even as corporate profits have hit historical highs.\n        The wage stagnation was masked, in part, by rising home equity that allowed many families to borrow heavily. It was cheap and easy money. But that debt burden could turn onerous as rates on adjustable mortgages rise. If jobs and housing head south together, the picture that emerges is one of families with inadequate -- if any -- financial cushions for the tough times ahead.\n        And, if the landing isn't soft -- the odds are about 50-50 now -- the economic pain is likely to be exacerbated by the fact that policymakers will have a narrow range of responses from which to choose.\n        The traditional remedies for a downturn are cutting taxes and cutting interest rates. But the reckless tax cuts of the last five years already point to worsening deficits in the future, leaving no room in the federal budget for more tax cuts.\n        The nation's poor financial condition could also muffle the generally salutary effects of interest-rate cuts. That's because the nation's persistent indebtedness could provoke a fall in the dollar, in which case higher interest rates would most likely be needed to attract the foreign loans the government needed to operate.\n        The figures from one month or one quarter are not enough to divine the future. So we can all still hope that economic reality won't bite.

It faults Mr. Annan for loose management, his staff for corruption and bungling, and the Security Council members for ignoring Iraqi oil smuggling and failing to restrain the surcharges and kickbacks that they knew Saddam Hussein was using to manipulate the program. The criticism of Mr. Annan, by a committee headed by Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, does not look strong enough to warrant his removal, as Republican critics have urged. But the panel's recommendations for urgent management reform should seize the attention of the world's leaders when they gather this month in New York.\n        The Volcker committee acknowledges that the oil-for-food program achieved its main objectives: it prevented widespread hunger and malnutrition, and it maintained international support for sanctions to block Iraq from gaining weapons of mass destruction. But Iraqi machinations drained the program of $1.8 billion in illicit revenues. Baghdad also earned a whopping $11 billion more -- entirely outside the oil-for-food program -- by smuggling oil to neighboring countries in violation of U.N. sanctions.\n        The committee says the Security Council mostly ignored the smuggling because it benefited allies of various Council members. The Council also approved a structure for the oil-for-food program that allowed Iraq to decide where to sell its oil and from whom it would buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. That became the avenue by which Iraq demanded kickbacks and imposed surcharges, producing illicit gains to bolster the Hussein regime. The Security Council also retained substantial operational control over the program, thus diluting authority normally delegated to the staff.\n        However, the staff bungled the duties it had. The program was left largely in the hands of Benon Sevan, a longtime U.N. official from Cyprus, who failed to curb abuses, investigate sanctions violations or monitor the program aggressively. He repeatedly withheld critical information from the Security Council on the wide scale of the kickbacks.\n        Although the Council was aware of kickbacks and did nothing to restrain them, it might have been goaded into action if Mr. Sevan had been more forthcoming. It is also extremely disturbing that the panel has accused him of banking some $147,000 in illegal kickbacks.\n        The Volcker report dispels lingering allegations by U.N. critics that Mr. Annan himself may have been corrupt. It absolves him of influencing the award of a contract to a company that employed his son, and found insufficient evidence to conclude that he had even known about the contract.\n        The secretary general's failures were not ethical lapses, but they were significant. Neither Mr. Annan nor his top aides exercised meaningful oversight, for example, over the oil-for-food program. Nor did they formally report what they knew about kickbacks to the Security Council. They made only minimal efforts to discuss sanctions violations with Iraqi officials.\n        Though these failures have been seen through the prism of a single program, it seems likely that they are endemic at the United Nations, where cronyism often trumps professionalism and the political goals of member states often undermine international efforts.\n        The Volcker panel has performed a valuable service -- and underlined the need for bold reforms -- by documenting how these conflicting forces let Saddam Hussein game the system.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1673289,"ids":1673289,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The latest struggle over the teaching of evolution in the public schools of Kansas provides striking evidence that evolution is occurring right before our eyes. Every time the critics of Darwinism lose a battle over reshaping the teaching of biology, they evolve into a new form, armed with arguments that sound progressively more benign, while remaining as dangerous as ever.\n        Students of these battles will recall that in 1999 the Kansas Board of Education, frustrated that the Supreme Court had made it impossible to force creationism into the science curriculum, took the opposite tack and eliminated all mention of evolution from the statewide science standards. That madness was reversed in 2001 after an appalled electorate had rejected several of the conservative board members responsible for the travesty.\n        Meanwhile, Darwin's critics around the country began pushing a new theory -- known as intelligent design -- that did not mention God, but simply argued that life is too complex to be explained by the theory of evolution, hence there must be an intelligent designer behind it all.\n        The political popularity of that theory will be tested today in a school board primary election in Dover, Pa., where the schools require that students be made aware of intelligent design as an alternative to Darwinism. The race pits those who voted last year for that rule against those who oppose it.\n        Now the anti-evolution campaigners in Kansas, who again have a state school board majority, have scrubbed things even cleaner. They insist that they are not even trying to incorporate intelligent design into state science standards -- that all they want is a critical analysis of supposed weaknesses in the theory of evolution. That may be less innocuous than it seems. Although the chief critics say they do not seek to require the teaching of intelligent design, they add the qualifier ''at this point in time.'' Once their foot is in the door, the way will be open.\n        The state science standards in Kansas are up for revision this year, and a committee of scientists and educators has proposed standards that enshrine evolution as a central concept of modern biology. The ruckus comes about because a committee minority, led by intelligent-design proponents, has issued its own proposals calling for more emphasis on the limitations of evolution theory and the evidence supposedly contradicting it. The minority even seeks to change the definition of science in a way that appears to leave room for supernatural explanations of the origin and evolution of life, not just natural explanations, the usual domain of science.\n        The fact that all this is wildly inappropriate for a public school curriculum does not in any way suggest that teachers are being forced to take sides against those who feel that the evolution of humanity, in one way or another, was the work of an all-powerful deity. Many empirical scientists believe just that, but also understand that theories about how God interacts with the world are beyond the scope of their discipline.\n        The Kansas board, which held one-sided hearings this month that were boycotted by mainstream scientists on the grounds that the outcome was preordained, is expected to vote on the standards this summer. One can only hope that the members will come to their senses first.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1666761,"ids":1666761,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The latest study of obese and overweight Americans upends much of what we thought we knew about the health dangers of excess poundage. After decades of dire warnings to slim down if we want to survive to a ripe old age, it now turns out that a modest amount of ''excess'' weight may actually be good for you, while being too thin can be dangerous.\n        This perplexing message comes from a study that looks like the most authoritative analysis yet of the relationship between mortality and the ''body mass index,'' a measure that correlates weight to height. The study was conducted by highly respected statisticians and epidemiologists with no visible axes to grind at two federal agencies: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Cancer Institute. It was published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n        The most striking finding was that people defined as overweight but not obese had a lower risk of death than people of normal weight. Indeed, their excess pounds may have prevented some 86,000 deaths annually. That estimate has exploded like a bombshell amid the health officials struggling to control the undeniable upsurge of obesity here and abroad. It leaves the C.D.C., in particular, with a lot of explaining to do.\n        Last year researchers from that health agency concluded that obesity and overweight were killing some 400,000 people a year in this country (later revised downward to 365,000). These figures were cited extensively in promoting a campaign to control obesity. Now the new study has put the toll at a small fraction of that. The study makes it clear that obesity, especially extreme obesity, can be lethal, causing some 112,000 extra deaths per year nationwide. But when the benefits of being modestly overweight are factored in (the 86,000 deaths prevented), the net excess mortality for all three categories is only 26,000. The C.D.C. needs to say, loud and clear, whether it believes the estimates. The whole notion of what constitutes normal weight and overweight may have to be rethought.\n        For now, slightly pudgy individuals would be wise not to take the findings as a license to overindulge. No one study in this topsy-turvy field can be considered definitive, especially since it is notoriously difficult to disentangle obesity from other causes of death. The new study looked only at death rates and did not address the impact of excess weight on developing diabetes and other ailments that are clearly not good for you.\n        One mystery is just why being modestly overweight may be beneficial. Some speculate that excess pounds may help an elderly person weather a medical crisis. Another theory is that excess weight is not really good for you, but that its effect has been blunted by medications and diet and exercise changes that lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Some experts fear that sooner or later, excess weight will again reveal its damaging impact.\n        With so much uncertainty, health-conscious Americans will want to keep their weight under control but perhaps not fret too much if they miss their weight goal by a bit.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1811342,"ids":1811342,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The linkage is troubling. There are sharp cuts in the budget and staff for the federal agency charged with keeping the nation's supply of fresh produce safe -- and soon we are faced with repeated cases of food poisoning from vegetables and fruits.\n        Two outbreaks of bacterial poisoning from fresh produce over the past three months, and a possible third that is still under investigation, raise doubts about the Food and Drug Administration's ability to inspect and monitor conditions on the nation's farms and in the plants that package and process their produce.\n        After 9\/11, the F.D.A. received a brief infusion of new money to bolster its inspections lest terrorists be able to contaminate the food supply. But that zeal soon wore off, and the Bush administration and Congress began reining in domestic spending to help pay for tax cuts for the wealthy and the war in Iraq. As Andrew Martin reported in Monday's Times, operating funds for the F.D.A.'s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition have dropped from $48 million in 2003 to an estimated $25 million for next year. Over the same period, the number of full-time inspectors fell from about 2,200 to 1,962.\n        Although F.D.A. officials insist that funding constraints have not hampered its work, that seems hard to believe given that the number of inspections for food safety fell sharply from 2005 to 2006. Meanwhile, the agency's workload has been rising steadily as health-conscious Americans eat more fruit and vegetables.\n        The Agriculture Department, which regulates meat and poultry, has had success in recent years cutting the number of bacterial outbreaks. It has a food safety budget more than twice the size of the F.D.A.'s, and it has almost four times as many inspectors to monitor far fewer plants. While the Agriculture Department typically has inspectors sitting in meat processing plants -- empowered to shut them down to correct safety problems -- the understaffed F.D.A. infrequently inspects the plants that package or process fruits and vegetables, and almost never inspects the growing fields until after a crisis arises.\n        At a minimum, Congress needs to provide the F.D.A. with more money and more inspectors to monitor the safety of fresh produce all the way from field to consumer. It should also abandon the fiction that voluntary guidelines to ensure safe food production can do the job, and insist instead on some kind of mandatory regulation.\n        It is also time to revive the long-languishing notion that all of the government's disparate food regulation activities should be combined into a single, fully empowered agency. It is absurd that lettuce should be regulated more lightly than beefsteak.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1815775,"ids":1815775,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The long history of Congressional bipartisan cooperation on environmental issues dating back to Richard Nixon has been seriously challenged only twice. The first time was in 1995, when the Gingrich Republicans swept into Washington determined to roll back environmental laws, a threat averted by President Bill Clinton's veto pen and the exertions of a group of moderate Republicans. The second challenge occurred during the Congress that has now thankfully drawn to a close.\n        The Democrats' return to power in both houses has raised hopes that some of the old cooperative spirit can be restored and progress made on vital matters like global warming, oil dependency, national parks and threatened wetlands.\n        Environmentalists in the House will certainly have more time to work on positive legislation, since they will no longer have to play defense against Richard Pombo, the California Republican who produced a stream of destructive schemes to open up protected public lands for commercial exploitation, rescind a longstanding moratorium on offshore drilling and undermine the Endangered Species Act. Mr. Pombo has been ushered into well-deserved retirement by California voters.\n        On the Senate side, there have been striking changes in leadership. Barbara Boxer, who cares about global warming, replaces James Inhofe, who doesn't, as head of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Jeff Bingaman, who emphasizes conservation as the appropriate response to oil dependency, replaces Pete Domenici, who tends to favor greater production of America's dwindling supplies of oil and natural gas, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n        Although he'll need Mr. Domenici's help, Mr. Bingaman will almost certainly make a major push for new energy legislation, based on proposals that already have broad bipartisan support and would offer a menu of loans, direct subsidies and tax breaks to encourage the production of fuel-efficient cars as well as alternatives to gasoline.\n        The main legislative responsibility for shaping a national policy on warming falls to Ms. Boxer, who has promised early consideration of various measures aimed at imposing mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions. Absent any support whatsoever from the White House and the Republican leadership, these measures have languished for years even as the problem has grown steadily worse.\n        Our own wish list would include several other measures, all within reach. One would be to amend the Clean Air Act to require meaningful reductions in mercury from power plants, overriding the administration's weak regulations. Another would provide robust financing for the national parks.\n        Finally, the new Congress needs to amend the Clean Water Act to clear up the confusion caused by several court decisions involving federal protection of wetlands. It should assert, in unmistakable terms, that the act protects all the waters of the United States, large and small, permanent or seasonal, navigable or isolated.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1662521,"ids":1662521,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The low point in the politicking over Terri Schiavo came last week when the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, threatened the judges who ruled in her case. Saying they had ''thumbed their nose at Congress and the president,'' Mr. DeLay announced that ''the time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior, but not today.'' Coming so close to the fatal shooting of one judge in his courtroom and the killing of two family members of another, those words were at best an appalling example of irresponsibility in pursuit of political gain. But they were not an angry, off-the-cuff reaction. Mr. DeLay's ominous statements were a calculated part of a growing assault on the judiciary.\n        Through public attacks, proposed legislation and even the threat of impeachment, ideologues are trying to bully judges into following their political line. Mr. DeLay and his allies have moved beyond ordinary criticism to undermining the separation of powers, not to mention the rule of law. The Schiavo case was the starkest example of their determination to have things their own way, regardless of the constitutional cost. Conservative elected officials and advocates repeatedly attacked the judiciary's right to decide the legal issues. When they were unhappy with the decisions of the Florida state courts, they rushed a bill through Congress that authorized the federal courts to rule on her case, but not on other cases like it. The bill also told the federal courts not to apply the time-honored legal doctrines that might have led them to stay out.\n        When the federal courts took the case but ended up agreeing with Florida's courts, federal judges became the next target. Mr. DeLay issued a veiled threat, saying: ''Congress for many years has shirked its responsibility to hold the judiciary accountable. No longer.'' Asked whether the House would consider impeachment charges against the judges involved, he responded, ''There's plenty of time to look into that.''\n        Several bills pending in Congress seek to tell the courts how do their jobs. House Republicans have introduced a resolution declaring that international law should not be taken into account in interpreting the Constitution, something the Supreme Court did just last month in striking down the death penalty for offenders younger than 18. Last year, during a controversy over the ''Ten Commandments judge'' in Alabama, Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, introduced a bill to bar the federal courts from applying the First Amendment when officials cross the boundaries between church and state.\n        Last week, Judge Stanley Birch Jr., a conservative member of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, declared that in the Schiavo case, ''the legislative and executive branches of our government have acted in a manner demonstrably at odds with our founding fathers' blueprint for the governance of a free people -- our Constitution.''\n        Judge Birch is right, but he should not be such a lonely voice. The founders established a system of government in which the three branches -- legislative, executive and judicial -- act as checks and balances for one another. Republicans in Congress and the Bush administration, unhappy with some rulings of the judiciary, are trying to write it out of its constitutional role. The courts will not always be popular; they will not even always be right. But if Congress succeeds in curtailing the judiciary's ability to act as a check on the other two branches, the nation will be far less free.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1848352,"ids":1848352,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The mayors of some of the world's biggest cities have every reason to feel especially anxious about climate change. Their populations are the biggest polluters but also among the most vulnerable to weather-related catastrophes. And they are far ahead of their national governments in giving urgency to global warming. So, for the second time since 2005, the leaders of dozens of cities, representing 400 million people, have stepped up. Meeting in New York this week, they produced a plan that should shame G-8 leaders into at least saying something about the issue at their meeting next month.\n        Most significantly, 15 cities, including New York, Chicago, Karachi, Toronto and Tokyo, signed on to a $5 billion program to make older buildings more energy efficient. Energy-gluttonous cities account for three-fourths of greenhouse gas emissions the world over, and buildings are responsible for 40 percent of emissions and much more in older cities. The project could reduce global carbon emissions by 10 percent.\n        It may be that the mayors, aware their powers end at the city limits, are more willing than holders of higher offices to take to innovation. When Mayor Clover Moore of Sydney asks residents to turn off lights for an hour, the city goes dark. Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago is distributing rooftop rain barrels, and already pipes 55 million gallons of rainwater into Lake Michigan every year. Toronto discounts electricity for citizens who conserve.\n        Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London and organizer of the group, bucked public opinion when he imposed a hefty fee (now about $16) to drive on London's busiest streets. The result was increased productivity for businesses, enhanced public transportation -- paid for with fee revenues -- and streets that flow so freely, buses sometimes pull over lest they run too far ahead of schedule. The congestion fee proposed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York -- $8 for most cars in much of Manhattan -- deserves swift approval from state lawmakers.\n        Sadly, the mayors' project on energy-efficient buildings would represent the single most significant government response to date on climate change. If it were enough, we would thank the mayors and ride our bicycles into the sunset, but, of course, it isn't. The job of containing climate-changing human actions -- from individual to industrial -- cannot occur in a vacuum.

Few politicians are offered the opportunity that greets Mr. Spitzer as he becomes New York's 54th governor.\n        Mr. Spitzer, who has built his career on reform, is arriving in a state capital that desperately needs it. The comptroller was forced to resign after pleading guilty to a felony. The Senate majority leader is being investigated by the F.B.I. for his outside consulting work. Another state senator is charged with stealing state money, and it took a state judge to force legislators to reveal how they spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxpayer money.\n        New York's government has slipped from a beacon for other states into a cautionary tale. So when Mr. Spitzer spoke of change in his inaugural address -- an end to government ''that works for those who hold office, not those who put them there'' -- he hit precisely the right note. With a passion and energy that Albany has not seen in years, this governor has promised to wake what he has labeled the ''Rip van Winkle'' government of the last decade.\n        Mr. Spitzer started on the right foot by issuing five executive orders to upgrade the ethics of the executive branch with rules that should go without saying, but in Albany never do -- like not using state property or personnel for personal use, and not taking gifts from people who do business with the state.\n        By cleaning his own house first, Mr. Spitzer will have the moral high ground as he does battle to get New York's recalcitrant lawmakers to do the same. After years of mostly dozing off, they require a long list: redistricting reform, campaign finance reform, ethics reform, and budget reform, including more sunlight on how $114 billion a year is being spent.\n        Getting reform through the Legislature will be hard enough, but Mr. Spitzer faces equally tough challenges in dealing with budget deficits and education needs and keeping the state's high taxes in check. In his inaugural address, he pointedly said that he does not believe in ''government as a heavy hand that can cure all our ills,'' a sign that some of his Democratic allies might not have as much clout as they are expecting.\n        Mr. Spitzer began setting his new tone on day one, with his ''people's inauguration.'' The official swearing-in was outdoors, public invited. He threw open the governor's mansion for the first time since most people waiting in line could remember. Instead of a fancy ball for fat-cat contributors, he spent the night of his inauguration at a free concert by James Taylor and other crowd favorites.\n        For the first time in years, we see a figure poised to rattle Albany's do-little establishment, to air out a dark, closed government and to try to convert New York's Legislature to the higher purposes of public service. New Yorkers can only hope Mr. Spitzer makes it all happen.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1794667,"ids":1794667,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The more the House Republican leaders try to defend themselves on the Congressional page scandal, the worse it looks. They still do not seem to appreciate how serious this is, especially for a party that poses as the arbiter of morality. And they appear to be trying harder to deflect blame from themselves than to get to the bottom of what actually happened. The F.B.I. has begun investigating, but that will be a prolonged process, and the voters have to render a verdict in five weeks. There is evidence emerging that they should consider.\n        Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, is responsible for the page program, and for seeing that the recent improprieties are properly investigated. His performance has been disturbing. As late as Monday, he was still minimizing the scandal. He said he understood that the improper contacts between pages and Mark Foley, the Florida Republican who resigned last week, occurred after the pages left the program. ''This was after the fact,'' Mr. Hastert said, ''and you know -- would have, could have, should have.''\n        First, it's not at all clear that events transpired after the pages left the program. And, in any case, why is that relevant? Surely preying on ordinary young Americans is just as vile as preying on pages.\n        Mr. Hastert hardly sounds like an effective leader who intends to investigate the allegations thoroughly, particularly now that the focus is shifting from Mr. Foley's conduct to whether House leaders covered it up. His remarks struck the same dismissive tone as the White House spokesman Tony Snow's references to ''naughty e-mails.''\n        It is disturbingly difficult to straighten out the basics of who said and did what when. John Boehner, the majority leader, was saying late last week that he did not recall informing Mr. Hastert that there was a problem with Mr. Foley. Now he is insisting he did and trying to dump the mess in the speaker's lap. Thomas Reynolds, the New York Republican who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee, insists he told Mr. Hastert this spring of his concerns about Mr. Foley. But Mr. Hastert says he does not recall being told.\n        There are more unanswered questions. When John Shimkus, the Illinois Republican who is chairman of the House Page Board, learned of the Foley problem, he informed the House clerk, but not the Democrat on the committee, or anyone in the Democratic leadership. It is unclear why he withheld the information. The pages' well-being should have been his primary concern, not partisan politics.\n        Mr. Reynolds, who was one of the few members of Congress to know about the Foley problem early on, insists he did all he had to when he ''took it to my supervisor,'' Mr. Hastert. But Mr. Reynolds is a key member of the House leadership, and his constituents need to know whether he knew enough to have done more than he did. We'd also like to know why, in the months when Mr. Reynolds was one of the few people to know of Mr. Foley's misconduct, Mr. Foley contributed $100,000 to Mr. Reynolds's Congressional campaign committee.\n        Every one of these political leaders is up for re-election next month. Voters should go into the booth with full information about how they all handled this challenge to their leadership.","adu_anecdote":15,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1782256,"ids":1782256,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The most frightening thing about the foiled plot to use liquid explosives to blow up airplanes over the Atlantic is that both the government and the aviation industry have been aware of the liquid bomb threat for years but have done little to prepare for it. What saved everyone was apparently superb intelligence work by the British, who apprehended the terrorists before they could carry out their scheme. It is unlikely that any of the scanning machines or screening personnel deployed at airports would have detected the potentially destructive materials before they could be carried aboard.\n        The plot apparently called for the terrorists to carry explosive ingredients disguised as beverages, and detonators made from common electronic devices like cellphones or music players. One theory is that they planned to use chemicals that are innocuous when carried separately but could be combined into an explosive mixture on board.\n        Unfortunately, the aviation security system is virtually defenseless against such an attack. The X-ray machines and metal detectors at airports can't identify liquid explosives. Officials have been fretting over this weakness off and on but have done little to develop and deploy technologies to block the threat. The government has been slow to buy so-called puffer machines that blow air on passengers to look for traces of explosive materials, and it has severely cut its budget for research on new detection methods. A few promising technologies are in the wings, but none seem ready to be rolled out quickly.\n        It is distressing that, after all the billions of dollars spent on bolstering aviation security, such gaping holes remain. Yet no matter what technologies are deployed, there is always a good chance that future terrorists will find a way to evade detection.\n        That makes us wonder if aviation authorities may have inadvertently hit on the wisest approach in their stopgap response to this latest plot. The Transportation Security Administration banned virtually all liquids and gels from carry-on luggage. That includes beverages, shampoos, toothpaste and other common items -- everything but baby formula and medicines, and those have to be inspected.\n        Some passengers have complained about the inconvenience, and many more might complain if they were not allowed to keep their iPods, cellphones or laptops with them.

If the polls are anywhere near accurate, most Americans have concluded that the Republican Party -- particularly the Republican majority in the House of Representatives -- has failed egregiously. On Iraq. On ethics. On oversight of a reckless White House. But that conviction sometimes comes into conflict with the feeling that a good representative should be rewarded with re-election, without regard to party.\n        All of that brings us to Representative Christopher Shays, a Republican from Connecticut's Fourth District. Mr. Shays has been in office for nearly 20 years, during which his state has grown increasingly Democratic. This year his race with Diane Farrell, a former first selectwoman of Westport, is regarded as one of the tightest in the nation.\n        The Times has endorsed Mr. Shays in every race in which he has faced a serious opponent. While this page has disagreed with him on many issues -- from tax cuts for the wealthy to warrantless wiretapping -- we have admired his independence and respected his leadership on issues like campaign finance reform.\n        Still, as his party has moved to the right, Mr. Shays has taken more and more stands with which we have profound disagreement. His position on immigration reform is far closer to the crabbed, xenophobic stance of the House Republicans than the fairer, bipartisan approach of the Senate. During the campaign, his remarks about the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison -- which he minimized as ''something less than torture'' -- were disturbing.\n        Ms. Farrell, Mr. Shays's opponent, is an excellent candidate. After eight years as first selectwoman, she has a better understanding than most legislators of the impact of federal mandates and tax policy on local government. She is smart and articulate, and her positions on the issues are extremely well thought-out.\n        When Ms. Farrell first challenged Mr. Shays two years ago, The Times chose to endorse him as a rare voice for moderation within a Republican caucus that seemed bent on distracting the electorate with assaults on gay marriage, flag burning and abortion while running up the deficit, encouraging a ruinous war in Iraq and supporting a White House bent on exalting the power of the president at the expense of the Constitution.\n        Now it is time to draw the line. Mr. Shays may be a beacon of integrity, but if he is re-elected, he will vote to continue House control by a party that has repeatedly sold out the country to special-interest lobbyists. His position on Iraq, which has gone through tortuous re-evaluations, now seems basically sensible. But if he is re-elected, he will support a Republican leadership that has refused to question even the most ruinous decisions by George Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld about the conduct of American foreign policy.\n        Mr. Shays has been a good congressman, but not good enough to overcome the fact that his re-election would help empower a party that is long overdue for a shakeup. This decision is painful, but not difficult, given the high caliber of his opponent. With due respect for Mr. Shays's service, we strongly endorse Diane Farrell for Congress.","adu_anecdote":13,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1694157,"ids":1694157,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The most surprising thing about the public's dissatisfaction with President Bush's handling of the economy, as expressed in recent polls, is the administration's apparent astonishment at Mr. Bush's low marks. His advisers have offered various explanations. Treasury Secretary John Snow says that strong consumer spending indicates that people don't feel as bad about the economy as they tell pollsters. He also suggests that part of the problem is that ''less educated people have seen their incomes and wages grow more slowly.'' Before a meeting with top economic advisers in Crawford this week, the president cited the high cost of energy and health care as weighing on ''the future of economic growth.''\n        There may be some truth to that. But the overarching explanation is that people are feeling insecure because they understand that today's economy is built on shaky fundamentals. Average Americans may not sit around fretting about America's outsized budget and trade deficits, and its unprecedented foreign indebtedness. But many of them -- as buyers, borrowers and employees -- are concerned about the increasingly bubbly housing sector.\n        The economy's shortcomings are nowhere more obvious than in the job market. Nearly four years into an economic expansion, job growth is still substantially slower than in previous recoveries. Wages for 80 percent of the work force are barely keeping pace with inflation, and aid for the workers hurt by global trade is paltry. Because Mr. Bush fails to acknowledge the lackluster job and wage growth, he fails to respond appropriately. The administration's insistence that the economy is getting better all the time -- a stance that is based on statistical aggregates that are often divorced from individuals' actual experience -- only intensifies the anxiety that people feel.\n        After the meeting in Crawford, participants said health care costs had been a major topic of discussion, though they wouldn't say what, if any, policies the president might pursue. Instead, they crowed about the administration's postvacation plans: to redouble efforts to privatize Social Security and to embark on ''tax reform,'' which is premised, in part, on permanent tax cuts for the wealthy and would therefore mean bigger deficits, drastic cuts in government services or higher taxes for everyone else.\n        At his vacation home, Mr. Bush told reporters that ''the economy of the United States is strong and the foundation for sustained growth is in place.''

The voters' role has been limited to ratifying their (often mediocre) choices. A telling statistic: From 1994 to 2002, 568 candidates were nominated around the state for seats on the State Supreme Court. Not a single challenger to the clubhouse favorite won his party's nomination.\n        Judge Gleeson has performed a valuable public service in pulling the plug on this sham. We also salute the lead plaintiff, Margarita L\u00f3pez Torres, for daring to challenge judicial politics-as-usual by bringing the lawsuit back in 2004. An ex-Civil Court judge who was elected Brooklyn surrogate last fall, Ms. L\u00f3pez Torres tried several times to compete for a Democratic Supreme Court slot, only to be shut out by party leaders offended by her refusal to let them dictate her choice of law clerks.\n        Judge Gleeson reasons that to pass constitutional muster, a system of judicial elections must afford qualified candidates a reasonable opportunity to compete and offer voters a meaningful say. Whether higher courts would agree entirely with his approach is uncertain. But his unflattering depiction of the hack-infested convention system and its undermining of the quality of the state's judiciary leaves the State Board of Elections and the local party organizations with no good reason to appeal. Instead, Mr. Pataki and members of the State Legislature should begin the long-overdue task of replacing the current discredited system of letting clubhouse politicians award positions on the state's top trial bench as if they were low-level patronage jobs.\n        Judge Gleeson has ordered primaries to select State Supreme Court nominees until state lawmakers pass legislation setting up a new system. The right permanent fix, however, is not to tinker with judicial elections, but to scrap them in favor of a new merit selection system for the Supreme Court. That is the only way to reward legal acumen and integrity over fund-raising ability, political connections and a willingness to spend lots of time greeting voters at subway stops. Such change requires amending the State Constitution, a multiyear process. All the more reason for Mr. Pataki and the Legislature to get cracking.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1816310,"ids":1816310,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The nation should welcome the ambitious agenda being offered today by the new Congress's Democratic majority, from raising the minimum wage to advancing stem cell research to restoring oversight of the executive branch. But the real test for the 110th Congress will be its willingness to clean up its own act by adopting forceful and credible ethics reform. That is what the Democratic leadership promised voters. Any hesitation will be rightly seen as a cynical re-endorsement of the Capitol's lobbyist-enabling, corruption-steeped business as usual.\n        Congress's ethics rules have been rife with loopholes and wrist-slapping punishments that grease rather than police the quid pro quo world of Washington. Fixing some of these problems requires nothing more than a majority vote on the House or Senate rules.\n        House Democrats appear ready to start with a firm, and long needed, ban on gifts, entertainment and junket travel -- including low-cost V.I.P. rides on corporate jets -- arranged by lobbyists or their clients. The ban should cover staffers as well, and the Senate should match it. Even that will require wary monitoring, particularly of a provision that would allow members preapproved day trips for speeches, with travel paid by non-lobbying groups.\n        Both houses should also bar Congressional alumni and other lobbyists from the debating floors and other Capitol inner sanctums. And members of Congress with other ambitions should be blocked from slyly negotiating lucrative private jobs while they're still on the public's payroll and sworn to defend the public's interest. There should be early disclosure of all job feelers.\n        The back-scratching closeness of politicians seeking campaign donations and deep-pocket interests seeking favors is a capital disgrace. Part of the solution is to douse their dealings with sunshine through prompt and detailed filing disclosures. And there should be full disclosure of the cornucopia of ''earmarks'' -- costly favors inserted without debate or any requirement to disclose authorship in mammoth spending bills. Earmark authors and beneficiaries should be unmasked in time to be mocked by taxpayers.\n        Broader reforms will require longer legislative debate, not just a rule change. Paramount is the need to create an independent office for ethics enforcement to end the clubbiness that more often than not covers up or excuses abuses. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ordered a bipartisan study of this vital proposal by March. We expect this overdue step to receive the forceful support of Ms. Pelosi and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader.

Of 103 arrests in areas including Washington, Los Angeles, Baltimore and Newark, the largest group of suspects, 30, was detained in Nassau and Suffolk.\n        The arrests were part of a campaign by immigration officials, working with state and local police departments, to make inroads against one of the country's largest and most fearsome street gangs.\n        MS-13, which emerged from communities of immigrants from war-torn El Salvador, has been linked to a wide range of criminal enterprises, including drug trafficking, the smuggling of weapons and people, car theft, money laundering, prostitution and extortion. Gang infighting and turf wars have led to brutal spasms of violence whose victims have also included police officers and civilians, not just in cities but also in rural America and the suburbs, as many residents of Long Island know only too well.\n        In this crackdown, federal and local law enforcement officials are cooperating without blurring their missions or job descriptions. Thus, it does not provoke as many qualms as the proposal a few months ago by the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, that county police officers be deputized as federal immigration agents. Nor is it exactly like the immigration roundups of hundreds of Muslim men that followed the 9\/11 attacks, which were widely criticized as an excessive application of brute federal power.\n        Law enforcement sweeps and roundups focused on specific populations or ethnic groups are certain to inspire concerns about civil rights and due process. But in this case, it appears that the authorities carefully chose their targets, using homegrown intelligence about suspects with serious rap sheets -- including convictions for murder, weapons violations and robbery -- and using their immigration violations as the basis for deportation proceedings. The effort is focused only on the most hardened criminals; casting a wider net would only overwhelm the government's ability to detain and process immigration violators.\n        It is possible, of course, as some immigrant advocates have warned, that an overzealous or inept assault on gangs like MS-13 could ensnare the innocent and frighten the public out of helping the police. But it is also true that inventive, aggressive law enforcement efforts like this will help communities that suffer the most from gang activity, from inner-city Los Angeles and Miami to New Cassel and Huntington on Long Island.\n        As long as the innocent are protected and immigration laws are not employed as a cheap and convenient way around the more time-consuming chores of shoe-leather policing, it only makes sense for federal, state and local authorities to team up with a wide array of tactics to address the gang menace.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1809827,"ids":1809827,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The nearly universal (and bipartisan) relief at the departure of Donald Rumsfeld ensured that Robert Gates would have an easy confirmation hearing.

He offered just enough candor and conciliation to persuade the senators that he plans to be a very different sort of defense secretary, while deftly holding back any real information about how he plans to clean up President Bush's mess in Iraq.\n        Mr. Gates's truth-telling did not go much further than acknowledging what is obvious to everyone but this White House. He agreed with various senators that the United States is not winning in Iraq, that politicians in Baghdad need to be pressured into negotiating a political settlement, and that the Pentagon botched the post-invasion by failing to send enough troops and committing other now infamous errors.\n        He was less accommodating when asked to share his prescriptions for Iraq, saying only that he was open to all ideas. Given both President Bush's and Mr. Rumsfeld's unrelenting denials of Iraq's disastrous reality -- and their refusal to accept the advice of others -- even statements of the obvious and a pledge to keep an open mind sound good. But Iraq is unraveling so fast that Mr. Gates will have to come up with opinions quickly, and be willing to express them to the president forcefully.\n        Mr. Bush has certainly shown little sign of opening his mind.

He said that he did not believe that the president had been given authority -- either under the 9\/11 war resolution or the Iraq war resolution -- to attack Iran or Syria (and would counsel against it). And he said bringing both countries into negotiations about Iraq's future at least ''merits thinking about.''\n        In any other time that would all be considered pretty bland stuff.

But since Sept. 11, the chemical industry -- a major campaign contributor -- has managed to ward off any significant new federal rules that might require it to spend money to increase security.\n        Now it is going a step further by trying to get the federal government to ''pre-empt,'' or invalidate, state and local efforts to impose safety standards. Supporters of pre-emption always claim that they just want a uniform standard. But in situations like this one -- where the federal law is absurdly weak -- it is obvious that the real agenda is to block serious safety measures at every level of government.\n        Congress wisely refused to include a pre-emption provision in legislation it adopted last year. Now, however, the Homeland Security Department has proposed regulations that would give itself the authority to pre-empt state and local laws. If the proposed regulations were adopted, they could wipe away the serious chemical plant security law that New Jersey has passed, and prevent other states and cities from requiring the chemical industry to do more to protect their residents.\n        It is up to Congress to act.

The new law should contain specific requirements for plant safety. It should also require companies to switch to safer chemicals when the cost is not prohibitive, a key safety measure that the industry has resisted. And it should clearly state that federal chemical-plant laws do not pre-empt state and local laws.

The White House and the new Congress still have a chance to create a bipartisan consensus on trade. They should seize it, for the good of the American economy, and for the good of the world's poorest nations, which need freer trade to pull themselves out of poverty.\n        There are some quick steps the White House and Congress should be able to agree on. To reassure workers at home, they could expand federal assistance to anyone thrown out of a job because of trade. At the same time, new tariff benefits for the least-developed countries, like Bangladesh and Cambodia, would send a positive signal to the rest of the world.\n        Over all, trade has been very good to the United States, which is still the world's largest exporter of goods and services. The trade liberalization measures put in place after World War II produce now, by one estimate, an additional $1 trillion in income for Americans annually, and millions of new jobs. The inexpensive foreign goods that arrive here because of free trade keep prices down. Low prices are good for consumers, and by keeping inflation and interest rates in check, they encourage economic growth and job creation.\n        Still, there is no question that the hundreds of thousands of workers who lose their jobs to trade-related dislocations each year are paying the price. The government has not done enough to take care of these displaced workers, and much of the blame lies with the economic policies of the White House and the last Congress, which was led by Republicans.\n        Now that the Democrats control Congress, they can champion both free trade and the rights of American workers. They should push to improve the social safety net, especially access to health insurance. And they should promote increased retraining and wage assistance for displaced workers.\n        To win Democrats' support, the White House will have to accept some of their demands for stronger labor provisions in future trade accords. Bans on forced labor and child labor, and similar mandates, are laudable goals. But Democrats who propose minimum-wage rules have to recognize that what is low pay for Americans may pull a family out of poverty in a less-developed country.\n        The administration's proposed farm legislation looks like a decent first step toward reducing subsidies and bringing American agricultural policy into line with our trade commitments. Now, if the administration can put together a solid plan for proceeding with negotiations for the Doha round of global trade talks, Congress should renew the president's fast-track negotiating authority. But if the global talks cannot be jump-started, the White House and Congress should move ahead with bilateral agreements with Peru, Panama and Korea.\n        Democrats are right to insist that the trade agenda advance the interests of all Americans, not just large corporations.

They're ideas, and we can't afford to watch them go. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Microsoft had trimmed more than $500 million from its annual tax bill by putting a small subsidiary in Dublin in charge of $16 billion in assets. The game is simple: a company sends intellectual property to a tax-haven country like Ireland and keeps the tax difference on the money it earns.\n        The world is used to seeing manufacturing businesses move to countries where labor is cheaper, like Mexico or China. But profits from software created and designed at Microsoft's headquarters, in Redmond, Wash., should be taxed in America, not Ireland. Unfortunately, outsourcing is extending itself to taxes, in large part because the United States Congress has given businesses the loopholes to do it. That means that America's greatest asset -- its intellectual property -- could be sent offshore to reduce corporate tax burdens.\n        Microsoft's subsidiary is raking in the dough from licensing fees for copyrighted software, much of it originating in the United States. And what is the subsidiary's legal address? A Dublin law firm that advertises its smarts in turning Ireland into a tax shelter.\n        Microsoft's response is that it pays all taxes required by law. Worldwide, that came to more than $4 billion for the company's last fiscal year. Tax avoidance is a gray area, and exploiting the cracks in the system isn't a crime. But the resulting damage, in terms of bigger budget deficits at home, sure makes it feel as if something is wrong.\n        Microsoft isn't alone. A host of American tech companies have set up shop overseas, both for business and tax purposes. And as for the destinations, they're more than just Ireland; Singapore, for example, also attracts businesses with low corporate rates. But one of Ireland's advantages for tax dodging over, say, Bermuda, is its plausibility as a home for genuine investment because it is a place where foreign corporations have built and staffed offices and plants. Microsoft has 1,100 full-time employees in Ireland, for example, compared with 40,000 in the United States.\n        That means, in a particularly hard-to-swallow twist, that the tax havens encourage companies to send increasingly large chunks of their businesses offshore as well. By pushing more of their jobs and investments overseas, the companies make the tax havens seem more legitimate.\n        American companies' successful hunt for low-tax opportunities overseas has been used as an argument for slashing corporate taxes at home. Maybe we should close the loopholes first, and provide the Treasury Department with the resources it needs to enforce existing law. After that, it's clear that meaningful corporate tax reform is needed. For an economy increasingly based on products with little physical substance -- drug recipes, images, sounds, strings of ones and zeroes -- it wouldn't take long to lose it all.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1655378,"ids":1655378,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The news of the Italian journalist whose car was sprayed by American gunfire on the way to the Baghdad airport stunned the world. But perhaps the worst thing about the wounding of the reporter, Giuliana Sgrena, and the killing of the Italian intelligence agent who was shielding her is that the attack wasn't unique.\n        On Jan. 18, American soldiers on patrol near Mosul were ordered to stop an oncoming car. After giving some warning shots, six soldiers sprayed the vehicle, firing at least 50 rounds. Chris Hondros, a photographer for Getty Images, said that when the car had come to a stop, he ''could hear sobbing and crying coming from the car, children's voices.'' A car door opened, and six children, one only 8 years old, tumbled into the street, splattered with blood. The parents of four of the children lay dead in the front seat, their bodies riddled with bullets. Back at the base, the company commander told the soldiers that there would be an investigation, but that they had followed the rules of engagement.\n        Both cases -- and presumably hundreds more like them -- are a dreadful reminder of the human cost of America's war with Iraq and the ensuing occupation. Iraqi civilians don't have to live only in fear of suicide bombers and masked insurgents. They also must fear being mistaken for an insurgent by jumpy American forces, which are told to shoot first and ask questions later.\n        American soldiers operate under rules of engagement that give them the authority to open fire whenever they have reason to believe that they or others in their unit may be at risk of suicide bombings or other insurgent attacks. No one can fault an American G.I. at a checkpoint who fires on a car that refuses to stop, because the insurgency has targeted such checkpoints with impunity. But with every additional civilian who is killed by American fire, the human cost rises -- both in terms of the lives lost and the psychological damage suffered by the Americans in uniform.\n        More broadly, these accidents further harm the United States' already shaky image abroad. And they play into the hands of extremists, who use them to vilify America and the American soldier.\n        It is the responsibility of those at the top of the chain of command -- the ones who write these rules of engagement -- to make sure that such rules are as close to mistake-proof as possible. That means studying hard the approach to each and every checkpoint put up by the United States military to make sure civilians understand that they should slow down. It means studying tactics used by others, like the British in Northern Ireland and the Israelis in the occupied territories, to gather every shred of useful information out there about how to construct checkpoints in a way that makes their presence obvious to anyone.\n        None of us want our soldiers killed by suicide bombers who get too close. But neither do we want these soldiers to have to live forever with the knowledge that they killed a heroic intelligence officer, or that they mowed down the parents of four Iraqi children in front of their very eyes, by mistake.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1836029,"ids":1836029,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The news that Monica Goodling, counsel to the attorney general and liaison to the White House, is invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination takes the United States attorney scandal to a new level. Ms. Goodling's decision comes just days after the Justice Department released documents strongly suggesting that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has not been honest about his own role in the firing of eight federal prosecutors. Mr. Gonzales is scheduled to testify before the Senate in three weeks, but that is too long to wait. He should speak now, and explain why he continues to insist that his department did nothing wrong.\n        As the liaison between the White House and the Justice Department, Ms. Goodling seems to have been squarely in the middle of what appears to have been improper directions from the White House to politicize the hiring and firing of United States attorneys. Mr. Gonzales has insisted the eight prosecutors were let go for poor performance, and that the dismissals are an ''overblown personnel matter.'' But Ms. Goodling's decision to exercise her Fifth Amendment rights suggests that she, at least, believes crimes may have been committed.\n        Last Friday night, the Justice Department released a calendar entry that directly contradicts Mr. Gonzales's insistence that he was out of the loop. It shows that he attended an hourlong meeting on Nov. 27 to discuss the upcoming firings of seven of the prosecutors. Previously, he had insisted that he never ''had a discussion about where things stood.''\n        The release of the calendar entry is disturbing because it suggests not only that Mr. Gonzales may have personally approved the firings -- something he has denied -- but that the Justice Department has been dishonest in its responses to Congress. The department had already released what it claimed was a full set of relevant documents, and it now says it simply overlooked the ones released on Friday. But the information about the Nov. 27 meeting may have been released because Mr. Gonzales's chief of staff, who was present at it, has agreed to testify before Congress this week.\n        The more information that comes out, the more disturbing the firings look. Mr. Gonzales is scheduled to make a routine appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 17. But there is, as John McKay, a fired United States attorney from Washington State, put it, ''a cloud over the Justice Department'' right now. Mr. Gonzales should testify this week.

Part of the price of every extra gallon helps, albeit indirectly, to finance mosques and religious schools all over the world that spread a fanatical variant of Islam that sees legitimacy in terrorist attacks. This financing, amounting to billions of dollars a year, comes from the government and private charities of Saudi Arabia, a country that is now taking in roughly $80 billion a year from oil exports.\n        Saudi Arabia is the source of only 15 percent of America's imported oil. But since oil is an interchangeable commodity in world markets, every barrel America imports, even if it comes from Venezuela, Nigeria or Mexico, helps push up the prices received by Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter. America now imports well over half of the oil it consumes, and more than half of United States consumption is in the form of motor vehicle fuels. Thanks to America's gas guzzlers, China's booming factories and other thirsty consuming nations, this has been an extremely profitable year for oil exporting countries. Overall global demand is at record levels, and OPEC's production recently reached its highest since 1979. Even with the latest slippage in oil prices, Saudi Arabia's low production costs allow it to reap a hefty markup on every barrel sold.\n        The Saudi government, itself under assault from Al Qaeda, is not in the business of directly financing terrorism, and since 9\/11 it has responded to American pressure to control the flow of charitable funds to active terrorist groups. But what it still pays for, and what the religious charities its citizens are obliged to contribute to pay for, is a worldwide network of mosques, schools and Islamic centers that proselytize the belligerent and intolerant Wahhabi variant of Islam that is dominant in Saudi Arabia. As a result of this oil-financed largess, the teachings of more tolerant and humane Muslim leaders are losing ground in countries like Indonesia and Pakistan. Wahhabi mosques that glorify armed jihad have also made alarming gains among the Muslim populations of Europe and the United States.\n        For years, Saudi Arabian oil money bankrolled the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and provided financial support to Pakistan's government. It was Saudi aid that allowed Pakistan to defy international sanctions imposed over its nuclear bomb testing. Without Saudi money there is some question whether chronically impoverished Pakistan could have ever afforded to develop nuclear weapons and the crucial bomb-related technologies that its scientists passed on to Iran, Libya, North Korea and perhaps other countries as well.\n        There is no sinister Saudi conspiracy at work here. This is just what anyone should expect to happen when mind-boggling sums of oil money flow into an absolute monarchy that bases its legitimacy on puritanical militant Islam and offers no pretense of political accountability or transparent accounting. The more copiously that oil money flows, the less pressure a divided Saudi royal family feels to undertake the kind of difficult political and economic reforms that might conceivably break the nexus between oil and terror.\n        The Saudi syndrome is not the only reason Americans need to get much more serious about energy conservation. But it is a powerfully compelling one.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1676637,"ids":1676637,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The next trade dogfight is gearing up on Capitol Hill, this time over a trade pact with six Central American countries that altogether have a combined economy smaller than Connecticut's. The Central American Free Trade Agreement, or Cafta, would open up trade between the United States and El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. It's far from a perfect trade pact, if any such thing ever existed. But Cafta still deserves to be approved.\n        Opponents include many Democrats, labor unions and America's sugar industry, and some of their arguments are much better than others. One of the most powerful lobbying groups, the sugar industry, complains that Cafta would bring 109,000 tons of sugar imports into the country every year to compete with the local product. This is true, and to that we say, ''Bring it on.'' The American sugar beet industry is one of the most coddled farm sectors in the world, and that's saying something. American consumers are paying inflated prices for sugar, and it is unfortunate that Cafta won't do more to redress that situation. As it is, the new Central American sugar would account for only 1 percent of consumption here.\n        A complaint that is far more worrisome is that the Bush administration didn't push the Central American countries to link labor rights more forcibly to the trade agreement. The pact does include a provision for fining countries that are not enforcing labor laws, but the administration could have done better. Nevertheless, Cafta would still be a win for Central American workers. More factory jobs in these poor countries would do wonders to provide low- or no-income people with options. Denying poor people in Central America the benefits of better access to the American market is certainly not the way to lift them out of poverty.\n        The most compelling argument against Cafta, however, is that it would siphon away American manufacturing jobs to Central America. That is happening anyway -- industries like textile manufacturing will continue to migrate to lower-wage nations. The economic reality of our increasingly interconnected world is that countries are best off if they lower trade barriers and try to specialize in producing the goods in which they have a comparative advantage. Places like the United States and Europe have no business trying to compete with El Salvador over who can make the cheapest T-shirts.\n        Poor countries have low-wage labor for unskilled manufacturing. America and Europe have the advantage in businesses that call for high-tech, high-skilled workers, good transportation and a sophisticated legal system. That classic free trade formula, for all the short-term pain it causes, provides for an overall gain in general economic prosperity.\n        None of that is an excuse for ignoring American workers who are hurt in the process. President Bush should, for example, couple his push for Cafta with a promise to put more money, and teeth, into America's underfinanced, lackluster Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which is supposed to help workers whose jobs shift overseas because of trade.\n        Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick said in a recent speech that it would be wrong to ''leave hundreds of thousands of Central Americans in poverty and helplessness because of the shortsighted protectionism of U.S. labor unions.'' He was right. But he should have gone a step further. We must also decide to help the American workers whose jobs are heading south, so that they, too, might benefit from the new world of global free trade.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":18,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1708890,"ids":1708890,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court has turned the usual partisan debate about judicial nominations inside out.

Now, charter members of the hurry-up-and-confirm-them crowd, like Senators Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, and Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, are already talking about voting no, even before Ms. Miers's confirmation hearings have begun. The same conservative legal groups that held rallies attacking Democrats for resisting the president's choices for the bench are now talking about blocking a Bush nominee.\n        During the Bush era, another constant of the confirmation process has always been the Republicans' resistance to Democrats' attempts to learn more about nominees, either by getting hold of documents or questioning them vigorously at their hearings. Now it's the Republicans who are demanding more information. After Ms. Miers visited with Mr. Brownback last week, he complained that she would not give her views on a key Supreme Court privacy ruling and indicated that he might vote against her.\n        Republicans are also complaining that Ms. Miers got her appointment based on cronyism. It is a legitimate concern, but a new one for many of the people raising it now. Republicans had no objections when President Bush nominated Brett Kavanaugh, an administration operative, to the powerful Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Mr. Kavanaugh, a principal author of the Starr report, was 38 at the time, and had remarkably little experience trying cases. Republicans also eagerly rallied around the nomination of Thomas Griffith to the same court, even though he had practiced law without the required licenses in two different jurisdictions.\n        If Ms. Miers's nomination has caused Republicans to suddenly acquire standards, it may be causing Democrats to forget theirs. Many appear to have calculated that Ms. Miers would be a more moderate justice than anyone the Bush administration would nominate if she were defeated. Perhaps as a result, Senate Democrats have been remarkably restrained about criticizing Ms. Miers's close ties to the president and the thinness of her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n        Even if the timing is politically opportune, it is still refreshing to hear Republican senators talk about the importance of judges' being highly qualified, and about their own obligation to question the president's nominees closely, including about their views on specific legal issues. That is how judicial confirmations are supposed to work, no matter which party is doing the nominating.

The advocate is nonetheless the second-highest-ranking city official and the first in line to succeed the mayor, albeit temporarily, in an emergency. There is no template for doing the job, but New Yorkers should expect their public advocate to be experienced, independent and resourceful.\n        The incumbent, Betsy Gotbaum, faces two tough challengers as she seeks re-election. Andrew Rasiej, a nightclub-owner-turned-technology-entrepreneur, has built a campaign on a good idea: getting low-cost wireless Internet service to everyone. But he has been light on the specifics of how to achieve it. His candidacy has seemed to be more of a novelty than a serious venture. Norman Siegel lost to Ms. Gotbaum in a runoff four years ago. A former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, he has been an earnest and often effective advocate in the courts for a wide range of groups. But his combative approach is better suited to litigating than to holding public office.\n        As for Ms. Gotbaum, she has been both diligent and disappointing. A former parks commissioner who also rescued the New-York Historical Society, Ms. Gotbaum has a long history of accomplishments in civic life. Yet she has seemed as shy of the spotlight as her predecessor, Mark Green, was eager to embrace it. Some of that is due to Ms. Gotbaum's more low-key style, but it also reflects the battles she has waged behind closed doors with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who cut her budget and staff. Ms. Gotbaum has chosen to use her limited resources to serve as the voice -- and, yes, as the advocate -- for the city's most vulnerable, underserved and invisible residents: poor families, battered women and schoolchildren. In doing so, she has ably filled a void in the city's leadership.\n        She fought budget cuts to get hot meals delivered to the elderly and to get school meals for low-income students. She marshaled federal, local and private resources to help get food stamps for needy New Yorkers, cutting through the red tape and bureaucracies to help thousands. In that same spirit, she took on failures in the foster care network, the shortage of affordable housing and severe crowding in city schools. And she railed against spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars for a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan.\n        Ms. Gotbaum does need to push herself to be more public as she advocates. That said, she is the best candidate for the job. We endorse Betsy Gotbaum.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1704105,"ids":1704105,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The official explanation for the collapse of some of the flood walls protecting New Orleans has been that Hurricane Katrina simply overwhelmed the system. But reports yesterday in both The Washington Post and The New York Times suggested that Katrina might not have been as powerful as advertised and that the real culprit was the system itself -- flood walls so poorly constructed that they were easily breached.\n        This points a finger at either the Army Corps of Engineers, which oversaw the design and construction of the flood walls, or Congress, which appears to have underfinanced the projects, or both.\n        Corps officials have said all along that the system was not designed to protect the city from hurricanes larger than Category 3, and corps spokesmen continue to insist that Katrina was a Category 4 hurricane when it hit the Gulf Coast. But federal meteorologists now say that New Orleans did not get the full brunt of the storm, whose strongest winds passed dozens of miles east of the city. What's more, sustained winds over Lake Pontchartrain reached only 95 miles per hour, even less than the winds of 111 to 130 miles per hour in a Category 3 storm.\n        Other research, meanwhile, has turned up serious weaknesses in the thinner and less stable flood walls built along the city's canal system beginning in the 1960's. The failure of these walls -- particularly along 17th Street and London Avenue -- led to much of the devastation.\n        Here again the research seems to contradict the official version, which is that extraordinary surges reached the top of or even ''overtopped'' the flood walls, causing some sections to collapse. Yet Louisiana State University researchers doubt the water ever got that high. Even if it had, they argue, it would have been contained by properly constructed flood walls -- essentially concrete slabs that resemble the sound barriers found beside highways.\n        A detailed analysis of the storm and of the city's defenses will take months. It is not clear, for instance, whether the flood walls' weaknesses were the result of faulty engineering and shoddy workmanship on the corps's part or whether they resulted from Congress's unwillingness over the years to provide enough money and leadership to do the job properly. What is clear is that whatever investigation Congress undertakes, either on its own or with outside counsel, it must meet high standards of diligence and spare no one, including those in Congress.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1819457,"ids":1819457,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The one crucial assumption behind everything President Bush proposed on Iraq last week was that Washington would have the wholehearted support of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. None of Mr. Bush's ideas -- his plan to send more American soldiers to fight alongside Iraqi units in Baghdad, his program for jump-starting the Iraqi economy, his hope of reconciling rival sectarian communities and heading off civil war -- can possibly succeed without the full cooperation of the Iraqi government.\n        Yet in the days following Mr. Bush's address, as in the days before, Mr. Maliki has demonstrated how far his own goals diverge from America's best interests or any reasonable path for containing Iraq's civil war. Consider, for example, Mr. Maliki's designation of Lt. Gen. Aboud Qanbar -- a Shiite officer known for his combative resistance to American tutelage -- to be the overall military commander of the new Baghdad security drive.\n        Any hope that this campaign will prove more effective than past failed efforts depends on soldiers' being able to finally move against Shiite militias. If General Qanbar and Mr. Maliki plan to continue shielding militias like the Mahdi Army, this new drive will be doomed before it begins.\n        What another failure would mean was underscored in a particularly grim way yesterday when the United Nations reported that some 34,000 Iraqi civilians died violently last year, a staggering number in a country of less than 27 million people. Yesterday, more than 100 Iraqis died in Baghdad alone.\n        Consider also the grisly decapitation over the weekend of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Saddam Hussein's co-defendant and half brother. Two weeks of watching how the lynch mob atmosphere of Mr. Hussein's execution instantly turned a monster into a martyr throughout the Sunni Arab world should have put Mr. Maliki on notice to get this one right. But whether deliberately or through breathtaking incompetence, the Iraqi government did not get it right, once again fanning sectarian flames.\n        Unless President Bush insists that Mr. Maliki accept specific and enforceable policy benchmarks and timelines -- starting with the disarming of sectarian militias -- the United States will remain hostage to the Iraqi prime minister and his radical Shiite agenda.\n        Mr. Bush needs to make clear to the Iraqi leader that continued American support will depend on his active cooperation.

That is certainly true in Morristown, where the mayor, instead of trying to calm tempers, seems to be doing everything he can to turn up the heat.\n        With his plan to deputize a sixth of the town's police force as federal immigration agents, Mayor Donald Cresitello acknowledges that he would like to drive the day laborers, most of them Hispanic, out of town. He says that he will respect their civil liberties. But his intemperate language and reckless claims disparaging the day laborers and their supporters seem almost calculated to inflame already angry residents.\n        At a recent Town Council meeting jammed with boisterous onlookers, Mr. Cresitello described thousands of immigrants as ''criminals,'' and put the blame for Morristown's relatively high crime rate on the estimated 200 day laborers who each morning line up near the train station, looking for work.\n        The mayor has also said that local ministers who have supported the immigrants had done nothing ''significant'' to address the problem. He delights in recounting incident after incident in which he says young immigrants were found urinating on residents' lawns and passed out in their backyards.\n        Under the mayor's plan, the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency would train 10 of the town's 58 police officers as deputy agents, which would give them the authority to begin the deportation process against illegal immigrants picked up for various offenses.\n        Federal immigration officials have so far deputized officers of about a dozen state and county agencies, mostly sheriff's departments. This makes sense because sheriffs run the jails and therefore need to check incoming inmates to see if they are in the country legally. But Washington is rightly leery of deputizing local police who might be encouraged to exert that authority in a heavy-handed manner.\n        Furthermore, Morristown's own police chief, Peter Demnitz, has been cool to the mayor's plan; he thinks it could discourage immigrants from reporting crimes against them. There have been numerous reports of day laborers who have been held up shortly after receiving their day's pay in cash, and some contractors are suspected of having cheated the workers of some of their earnings.\n        At this point, Mayor Cresitello should lower his voice and pursue a constructive approach. An essential first step would be to set up a hiring site, with toilets, where day laborers looking for work could gather and contractors could hire them. Officials at the site would monitor and register both workers and contractors, to discourage worker disorderliness and deter unscrupulous contractors. This could go a long way towards defusing the issue.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1751451,"ids":1751451,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The page you are now reading is the beginning of an answer to an old riddle: How can the editorial pages of The Times be global and local at the same time?\n        Until recently, our editorials and Op-Ed articles have been like a camera with four main settings: World, Nation, Washington and New York. The rest of the metropolitan region wound up in the awkward middle distance, popping into the frame sometimes, but not with the frequency or fine detail that our readers deserved.\n        The Times will always speak with one editorial voice, but we're expanding the opportunities for conversation. As of today, New Jersey will have its own editorial page every Sunday. We've been wanting to do this for a long time, and to begin with, let's share some bedrock assumptions. Here are a few things we believe:\n        That New Jersey is a place with a marvelous sense of identity. While residents of New York City often have only the vaguest understanding that there's a state out there somewhere, people in New Jersey are keenly aware not only of Trenton, but also of the cities, counties, townships and boroughs whose problems or triumphs can often wash over into their neighbors' backyards..\n        That the region matters. Officials may squabble over which side of the Hudson gets this office tower or that corporate headquarters, but on the ground, state lines dissolve. The character of New Jersey has a great deal to do with its proximity to the jobs and culture, high and low, created by New York City. What's good for New York is good for New Jersey. Usually.\n        That it's possible to be concerned about affordable housing and also worried about exurban sprawl.\n        That deer and bears are wonderful, but not so wonderful that none should ever be shot.\n        That people who must travel great distances to work by train or bus are ennobled by their suffering and deserve a decent ride and a designation more dignified than ''commuter.''\n        That private property must be protected, but that the designation does not include a shoreline that is kept in existence by the taxpayer-financed Army Corps of Engineers.\n        That while the political culture in Trenton could in some ways compare favorably to that in, say, Albany, New Jerseyans still suffer from bad government -- whether it is outright corruption or the series of deals and winks that led to failures from pension abuses to school construction scandals.\n        Expect more such assertions in coming weeks.

In the lingering glare of Brooklyn's judicial patronage scandal, the moment is ripe for dramatic reform.\n        Meanwhile, these are our recommendations for the four Civil Court seats that are actually being contested in the upcoming Democratic primary in Manhattan and Brooklyn:\n        Manhattan, Second District (East Village, Lower East Side, SoHo, NoHo, Little Italy and part of Greenwich Village and Chinatown): The field here includes two unusually promising candidates. Andrea Masley is the principal court attorney to a state Supreme Court Justice sitting in the division that handles commercial cases. David Cohen is a sitting housing court judge who previously worked in the litigation office of the state Attorney General's office. A third candidate, Margaret Chan, is a solo practitioner with commendable concern for improving access to the justice system, but her credentials are weaker than her competitors.' The court system needs judges with Ms. Masley's expertise in commercial litigation, but in a close call Mr. Cohen's experience as a housing judge earns our endorsement.\n        Manhattan, Seventh District (Morningside Heights, West Harlem, Inwood and Washington Heights): The standout in this two-candidate race is Rita Mella, the experienced and well-regarded law assistant to Brooklyn Surrogate Margarita Lopez Torres. Her intelligence, independence, excellent people skills, and impressive knowledge of the law hold great promise for her service on the bench, and we are pleased to endorse her. The second candidate, Mary Rosado, is a longtime community activist who is also capable, but she is not in the same league as Ms. Mella.\n        Brooklyn (countywide): In this crowded contest for two countywide Civil Court seats, our endorsements go to Pia Wood, a longtime attorney in the contracts and real estate division of the corporation counsel's office, and Dena Douglas, a former bureau chief in the Brooklyn district attorney's office who recently held law enforcement jobs in Washington. Ms. Wood's shortage of litigation experience, and Ms. Douglas's backing by the Democratic organization give us pause.

Once again, boosters could claim that what the rest of the world calls football would finally hit the big time in the United States -- for a mere $250 million over five years.\n        Cannier observers pointed out the similarity to the multimillion-dollar signing of the legendary Brazilian soccer star Pel\u00e9 by the New York Cosmos three decades ago. That gave the sport a brief jolt in this country but one that quickly faded, followed by the failure of that era's professional league.\n        The news of Mr. Beckham's move -- and that of his paparazzi-magnet wife, the former Posh Spice -- overshadowed this week's announcement that Clint Dempsey would be leaving.\n        Who is Clint Dempsey?\n        He is a 23-year-old firebrand midfielder who scored the only goal by an American in last year's World Cup (the Italians scored one on themselves for us) and briefly raised hopes that the United States could advance to the second round. He was the 2006 player of the year for the United States national team, but that hardly makes him a household name.\n        Naturally, Mr. Dempsey is on his way to Europe -- the English Premier League team Fulham -- where arguably the best professional soccer is played. While Mr. Dempsey has a bright future, Mr. Beckham, at 31, may have his best days behind him. Don't get us wrong, he is still good. But he decided to cross the Atlantic only after losing a step, and his position as captain of the English national team.\n        Beyond the money and the glamour, Mr. Beckham's story appeals to us because it matches a notion we Americans cherish about ourselves: We are a destination. The best want to come here, play here and live here. We aren't accustomed to sending our children abroad to seek their fortunes the way other countries have, be they Ireland or Mexico.\n        Mr. Beckham has made a sizable splash, but the future of the sport in America probably rests on the Latino immigrants who arrive with a love of the game and pass it on to their children. Until then our homegrown talents will blossom abroad.

But there is a growing risk that this chance could be squandered through the failure of Israeli and Palestinian leaders to work out even the simplest arrangements for managing the imminent transfer of physical assets and political authority.\n        Among the issues still unresolved at this point are who will bear the costs for clearing away demolished settler homes, how to preserve existing jobs in Gaza and create a more self-sufficient economy there, and how to ensure security while allowing the smooth passage of people and goods through new checkpoints for border security.\n        The world has too much invested in a well-managed Gaza transfer to sit by while these issues fester. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the international community's representative, James Wolfensohn, should put aside the diplomatic niceties and make sure that Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, keep their eyes on the long-term goal of moving this conflict from the deadly violence of recent years back to the negotiating table. Sadly, most of the blame for the current paralysis lies with Mr. Sharon, the same man who courageously pushed the Gaza withdrawal idea through a reluctant Israeli political system.\n        Mr. Sharon appears to have become so fixated on making the withdrawal appear palatable to the Israeli right that he has lost sight of the larger strategic calculus of building peace. He wants to advertise the pullback as a unilateral Israeli measure, undertaken for Israel's own reasons, and not as part of any larger negotiated deal with the Palestinians, or still worse, as a response to Palestinian terrorism.\n        He has become so determined to show that the Palestinians will not be reaping any rewards from Israel's withdrawal that he has shunned taking simple steps that could significantly improve the quality of Palestinian life in Gaza, like paying to clean up the rubble of the settler homes Israel intends to destroy, facilitating the reopening of Gaza's airport and finding ways to make border security less humiliating and time-consuming for Palestinians.\n        Demonstrating to the Palestinians that they haven't really won anything is far, far less important to Israel's well-being than strengthening the authority and credibility of moderate Palestinian leaders like Mr. Abbas by carrying out a smooth transition that improves the lives of Gaza's 1.3 million Palestinians.\n        Mr. Abbas is fighting a two-front political battle in the Palestinian community and seems to be losing ground. On one side, he is challenged by old-guard elements of his own political party, Fatah, who keep dragging their feet on scheduling parliamentary elections and other overdue reforms. On the other, he faces a rapidly strengthening opposition movement, Hamas, which is building popular support through its extensive network of social welfare programs while refusing to follow Mr. Abbas's lead in renouncing terrorism.\n        With Israel taking a chilly ''that's for you to work out'' approach to the logistics of the transfer, Mr. Abbas has begun responding in similar tones. That is a luxury neither side can afford, and the rest of the world can't either. Ms. Rice and Mr. Wolfensohn need to spend the next month getting the two sides working together constructively on a smooth transfer that builds a basis for a wider peace.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1656568,"ids":1656568,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The plunder of the Roslyn school district is both an outrage and an opportunity. After the utter collapse of any fiscal oversight allowed school officials there to rob taxpayers blind for eight years, prosecutors are on the case, legislative remedies have been proposed and restitution is being sought.\n        It was a costly lesson -- the final tally of misdirected money came to at least $11.2 million, according to an audit this month by the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, that outlined in sickening detail how the district's former superintendent, Frank A. Tassone Jr.; its former business manager, Pamela Gluckin; and others turned an affluent school system into their personal trough.\n        But if the rifling in Roslyn -- all those casino trips, luxury-car and mortgage payments and seemingly limitless A.T.M. withdrawals in what even the seasoned Mr. Hevesi called a ''breathtaking'' abuse of public trust -- ultimately gives rise to a culture of by-the-book probity and professionalism in the often cozy, part-time world of local school districts, the sum will seem worth it.\n        Whatever good emerges from the debacle in Roslyn -- as well as the similarly troubled William Floyd school district, and others under Mr. Hevesi's scrutiny -- could be felt statewide. Mr. Hevesi has given seminars to school officials around New York to help them spot fraud, and is seeking $5.8 million from the state to hire 89 new auditors to resume regular school audits that were abandoned years ago. Gov. George E. Pataki has included only half that amount in his current budget, with the annoying condition that it be controlled by his budget division, not the comptroller's office. This is no time for games -- Mr. Pataki should give Mr. Hevesi the money he wants and the wherewithal to spend it as he sees fit.\n        A bipartisan array of lawmakers, meanwhile, including Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli and Senator Michael A.L. Balboni, is backing legislation to impose new safeguards on school districts' finances, including training for board members and new audit committees.\n        These are worthy efforts, and should be enacted quickly, for there is a longer struggle to be waged: to repair public confidence while fostering, among citizens in Roslyn and elsewhere, a sensibility that is engaged yet healthily skeptical -- cautious without being cynical, dubious but not detached.\n        In a place with as many taxing entities and as much money as Long Island, it helps to remember that the suburbs have long been sumps of official corruption. From Crookhaven in Suffolk to the Republican romper room of not-so-long-ago Nassau, from Gov. John G. Rowland's Connecticut to the inimitable New Jersey, bedroom communities are where crooks like to congregate, because, like banks, that's where the money is.\n        This means attention must be paid, even -- or especially -- in the luxurious confines of places like Roslyn. ''Most offenses are committed through greed, not need,'' is a criminologist's dictum cited in a book about a smart, well-bred scoundrel who, like the slick charmer Dr. Tassone, baffled and bemused his affluent peers by committing audacious, heinous acts.

Instead of Robert Frost's taciturn gentlemen hoisting stones, we have officials lobbing lawsuits and retaliatory measures.\n        Greenburgh has sued in State Supreme Court, claiming that the environmental review for Ridge Hill was inadequate. Its supervisor, Paul Feiner, says he does not want to kill the project, only to wound it -- he would like to see the retail component of Ridge Hill cut in half, by 500,000 square feet, to lessen the likelihood of what he and many others in the area predict will be an ominous rise in traffic, noise and pollution.\n        Mr. Feiner's solution is scoffed at in Yonkers, which wants Ridge Hill to be big -- a big and mighty economic engine that will pull the city out of its perennial financial dumps. The city is so irritated by what it considers the chronic opposition of its northern neighbors to border development that it has sought to punish the villages of Ardsley and Hastings-on-Hudson for joining Greenburgh's lawsuit. The villages once had a contract with the city to truck their yard waste to a dump on Nepperhan Avenue, but not anymore.\n        Greenburgh's lawsuit, Yonkers's petty tit-for-tat and the continued verbal sparring by officials and their surrogates in the press are an unpleasant sideshow made all the more unappetizing by the fact that the fighting could and should have been avoided.\n        As Yonkers officials and the developer, Forest City Ratner (which is also the developer of the Times's new headquarters in Manhattan), bulldoze forward with their Ridge Hill dream, they need to remain acutely aware of the facts on the ground. They can call it a ''village,'' but that doesn't make it one. It's a $660 million mini-city. If they are honest they will acknowledge that concerns about Ridge Hill have been raised by thoughtful critics from the earliest stages of the proposal, and that these concerns still have not been resolved.\n        Everybody seems to agree on the worthiness of this project, at least in principle; even Mr. Feiner says he would support it if the traffic issue could be resolved. But the problems and ill will that keep sprouting in its wake can only point to heedless hastiness by the City of Yonkers in its rush to break ground on Ridge Hill.\n        Yonkers should redouble its efforts to soothe the indignation and ruffled feelings caused by its bursting ambitions. A recent closed-door meeting at Yonkers City Hall that included representatives from Yonkers, Greenburgh, Ardsley, Hastings-on-Hudson and Forest City Ratner produced no specifics but a few soothing words. It was a step forward, but a tenuous and belated one. Such meetings should continue, out in the open.

A decent solution is now there for the taking, if President Bush and the newly Democratic Congress are willing to grab it.\n        It won't be easy. Some of the debate's loudest shouters, liars and dead-horse beaters were ushered by voters from the room -- people like J. D. Hayworth and Randy Graf in Arizona, John Hostettler in Indiana and Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania. But the public is still in a prickly mood. All those shrill Republican ads about Mexicans stealing your Social Security failed as an electoral strategy, but that doesn't mean politicians always lose by being immigration hawks. Voters approved tough ballot measures. In Arizona, they made English the official language and restricted illegal immigrants' ability to sue, receive bail and qualify for benefits.\n        And except for the losers on the border-fixated fringe, not many in the restrictionist camp seem particularly chastened by the election. Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, an opponent of the comprehensive reform bill that passed the Senate this year, won his race, as did several new Democrats who ran as immigration hard-liners. Local lawmakers in Texas and other states are still going after illegal immigrants with fervor.\n        The roots of a divisive, grinding immigration debate have not gone away. But it is crucial that the Democrats find their voice. The effort to revive immigration reform should start in the Senate. There is a decent bill under the barnacled hulk of legislation that passed the Senate last May. It used to be called McCain-Kennedy, before other senators tacked on tough-posing amendments that made it fundamentally unworkable and unjust. The Senate should strip those away, like the ones that divide immigrants into three arbitrary tiers of worthiness and needlessly force those seeking legal status to trek to a border state to apply for it.\n        The principles that guided the original McCain-Kennedy bill are those that should guide the coming reform effort: laws should be enforced at the border and workplace, fairly and evenhandedly; temporary worker programs must not be used to create a permanent official underclass; and any reform must be designed to work and not just create another smothering bureaucracy.\n        Immigration remains a high-voltage issue that Congress may be too timid or distracted to touch. The new Democratic leaders, including Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi, have conspicuously not listed immigration among their most urgent priorities. Even Senator John McCain, who is an architect of the most reasonable bill out there but also has presidential primaries on his mind, spent a lot of time this fall stumping for misguided restrictionists like Mr. Graf. We hope he and his moderate colleagues have the integrity to honor their sensible immigration views now that the dismal '06 campaign is done.\n        Many voters who scorned Republicans over immigration reacted as you would expect them to after being mocked and exploited by a party that elevated the issue into an urgent crisis and then offered nothing to solve it but faux hearings, strident campaign ads and a pretend fence.

But the main responsibility for breaking the clubhouse-courthouse nexus, and giving New Yorkers the impartial judicial system they deserve, belongs to the State Legislature in Albany, which should replace the existing patronage-based system of electing judges with a system of appointing them by merit. That, in turn, will require a constitutional amendment.\n        Two continuing investigations into judicial and political corruption in Brooklyn demonstrate how important it is for Albany to move forward. In one case, a State Supreme Court justice, Gerald Garson, has been suspended from the bench and is awaiting trial on bribery charges. A key witness in that case admitted last week to passing thousands of dollars to a politically connected lawyer to arrange preferential treatment in cases before Justice Garson. The investigation into the judge's rulings is also seeking to establish links between him and the Brooklyn Democratic machine.\n        The other case involves allegations by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct that a Surrogate's Court in Brooklyn may have fleeced widows and other heirs out of millions of dollars. On Feb. 14, the commission found that Michael Feinberg, a Kings County surrogate judge, had named a friend and law school classmate, Louis Rosenthal, to handle the legal matters of people who died without wills and then rubber-stamped Mr. Rosenthal's legal fees of $9 million. The commission described $2 million of these charges as ''excessive.''\n        Judge Feinberg, who has also been suspended, had been supported in his campaign for the surrogate judgeship by the local political boss, Clarence Norman Jr., as well as by Mr. Rosenthal. Shortly after becoming a surrogate, Judge Feinberg gave Mr. Rosenthal the responsibility to wind down the estates of people who die without wills. This is a lucrative business -- in Kings County alone last year, there were some 1,200 such estates, with a total worth of more than $57 million.\n        Earlier this month a special commission appointed by Judge Kaye recommended a series of reforms dealing in particular with the lawyers who, like Mr. Rosenthal, handle these estates. The reforms would apply the same rules that now prevent the court from awarding fiduciary appointments -- like guardianships -- to relatives, friends and others with questionable ties and would require a cap on fees. Judge Kaye is also seeking broader, systemic reforms that among other things would blend Surrogates' Courts into the rest of the system. But nothing would better serve the judicial system than minimizing the clubby relationship among judges, politicians and lawyers by basing judicial selections on merit alone.\n        In recent months, of course, Albany has been preoccupied -- and properly so -- with reforming its own institutions. But as legislators fix their own house, they should not ignore the needs of this other ailing branch of government.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1822024,"ids":1822024,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The proposed New Jersey to Manhattan commuter rail tunnel, widely regarded as vital to the economy of both New York and New Jersey, is moving into a critical period that could decide whether or not it actually gets built.\n        Largely because of the efforts of New Jersey Transit director George Warrington, who has announced his intention to step down at the end of March, the massive project has blossomed beyond being merely a dream of transportation planners and New Jersey cheerleaders. Officials in New York now support it and want to start construction in 2009.\n        And just this month, a key federal agency approved a draft of the tunnel's environmental impact statement, an essential step for getting federal funds.\n        But there are major hurdles to surmount during the next two years. The deficit-plagued federal government will have to come up with up to half of the $7.2 billion estimated cost. And even though the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has pledged $2 billion, New Jersey, which has its own budget problems, may have to come up with more than the $500-million it has promised. And even that may not be enough.\n        Since Mr. Warrington will not be around to keep the pressure on, there's a risk that some of this necessary funding may dry up or that other smaller, less important pet projects of various politicians may drain off money. It is imperative that New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, a strong supporter of the tunnel, name a successor with the same expertise and sense of commitment that Mr. Warrington has displayed.\n        The need for the tunnel is enormous. Currently, a 96-year-old Amtrak-owned tunnel with two tracks is the only rail link under the Hudson River. Serving both Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains, the link carries 45,000 passengers each peak period when 24 trains an hour are squeezed through the tunnel. If there is a breakdown, rail transportation between New Jersey and Manhattan stops. The new tunnel, which would end under 34th Street on Manhattan's West Side, would provide essential backup and double the number of trains that could enter and exit Manhattan from New Jersey.\n        Besides improved service for commuters from west of the Hudson, the new tunnel is essential for New York City's economy, which is expected to become increasingly dependent on workers from New Jersey, Rockland and Orange counties in New York, and even Pennsylvania, as the years go by.\n        It is this argument that Mr. Warrington used to get Gov. Eliot Spitzer, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Hillary Clinton, Sen. Charles Schumer and other key New York city and state officials behind the project.\n        And it is this argument, together with the importance of a healthy New York-New Jersey metropolitan area to the economy of the entire nation, that Mr. Warrington's successor will have to make in Washington to get the needed federal money.\n        For the tunnel to become a reality, New Jersey Transit will need one of the most able and persuasive mass transit directors in the country.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1666938,"ids":1666938,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The proposed merger between the New York Stock Exchange and Archipelago, an electronic trading network, is being touted as the salvation of the Big Board, whose trading-floor auction system has looked increasingly archaic in an era of high-speed communications.\n        If the merger strengthened the exchange, it would also benefit New York City and Lower Manhattan. But whether the merger would make much difference to the average citizen is not yet clear. A good guess is that the merger might, when coupled with other trends, lead to marginally lower costs for executing stock trades and marginally less opportunity for insiders to commit fraud.\n        The deal must still pass muster with federal regulators, who will decide whether the merger of two companies that are to some extent competitors would nevertheless benefit customers by girding the exchange to compete against Nasdaq, the second-ranking stock market. Yesterday Nasdaq announced its own deal, which includes buying the electronic trading platform of the Instinet Group to help it compete better in the increasingly brutal struggle over stock trading.\n        The small investor can only hope that these maneuvers will enhance the recent trend in which competition, electronic trading and regulatory pressures have combined to drive down trading costs.\n        Replacing the secretive nonprofit exchange with a publicly traded company could offer benefits. The exchange lost all sense of propriety when it awarded its former president, since ousted, an obscenely high benefits package. That would be less likely to happen in a publicly traded company.\n        The New York Exchange suffered a further blow to its reputation when 15 former specialists, the floor traders who are supposed to maintain fair markets for customers, were indicted on charges of trading for their own benefit before that of their clients. The exchange uncovered the chicanery itself, but its response was so lethargic that federal authorities stepped in to impose fines and bring indictments.\n        If more trades moved from the floor to the computer, there would be less opportunity for cheating. In addition, the exchange's regulatory function would move to a separate nonprofit unit with an independent board, keeping it at arm's length from the core market operations.\n        No system is foolproof, of course, so even in the event of a merger, regulators would need to do their utmost to keep the criminals at bay.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1737396,"ids":1737396,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The recent four-part series in The Times offered grim insights into the incurable disease diabetes. Ignore it, and it can lead to heart disease, strokes, amputations and shortened lives. It is the leading cause of blindness. Most of those who have diabetes have Type 2, in which obesity and poverty are key contributors, especially among blacks and Hispanics, who are disproportionately stricken. It is not uncommon in poor and minority communities, the worst hit, to see amputees in wheelchairs.\n        The neighborhoods where diabetes runs rampant are almost always short on parks for exercise and have schools that rarely conduct gym classes. Fast food restaurants abound; healthy food is often expensive or unavailable and bad diet choices -- laden with sugar, fat and calories -- are readily at hand. Diabetes is a disease defined by economic disparity. In heavily Hispanic East Harlem in Manhattan, the illness plagues 14 percent of the population; just to the south, across 96th Street on the more affluent Upper East Side, the rate is under 2 percent.\n        The sheer cost of caring for diabetics, who often do not get help until they are in catastrophic need, will keep going up. The financial burden of attending to diabetes' many uninsured victims eventually lands on state and local governments. In New York City -- where one in eight adults has diabetes, almost 150 percent more than just 10 years ago -- that cost is about $200 million annually and growing.\n        It would be better for everyone if more diabetics took care of their disease through diet, exercise, medication and regular blood testing. But many diabetics, about one-fourth, simply don't know they have the disease, which can be without symptoms for years. Others don't know what is required to treat it. Even if they did, blood testing strips cost about 75 cents per use, an expense that can run into thousands of dollars annually. It should be no mystery that the United States, the only leading economic power without national health care, also leads the world in the per capita rate of diabetes. Care as basic as regular visits to a nutritionist are not typically covered by insurance. Reimbursement is easier when the disease is far along, and the patient needs dialysis or amputation of toes or limbs.\n        Waiting for this epidemic's fuller toll is foolhardy. Now is the time to develop a coordinated plan with a long view to take control of diabetes.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1825932,"ids":1825932,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The recovery along the Gulf Coast and particularly in New Orleans is going too slowly, and there are steps the government can easily take to speed the process. One thing the Bush administration should have done immediately after Hurricane Katrina was to waive the requirement that state and local governments match federal rebuilding funds. The time to correct that mistake is now.\n        Much of federal disaster aid is handed out according to the Stafford Act, which calls for states to ante up a quarter for every 75 cents provided by the federal government. That way, locals still contribute what the law deems a fair share of each rebuilding dollar. When the damage exceeds $110 for each person in the affected state, the split increases to 90 percent for the federal government with a 10 percent local match.\n        Since 1985, the local matching requirement has been waived entirely for 32 separate disasters. It was waived for the State of Florida after Hurricane Andrew, when damage was $139 for each Floridian. It was waived again for New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, which cost $390 per New Yorker.\n        Yet somehow the Bush administration has not found it necessary to forgive the local match for Gulf Coast states after the double-whammy of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, except for costs associated with debris removal and some emergency services -- despite the fact that the two storms wreaked roughly $6,700 worth of damage per capita in Louisiana. This inaction is particularly surprising, given that such a large proportion of the damage can be attributed to the failure of the federal levees that were supposed to protect the New Orleans area.\n        State officials say they have set aside close to $1 billion to help struggling local governments pay matching funds for things like replacing police stations and repairing sewage systems. They are trying to cover some 20,000 construction projects in all, ranging from tens of thousands of dollars to millions. That's no small amount of administrative and bureaucratic hassle on top of the expense.\n        Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana has been asking President Bush for the waiver since September 2005, shortly after Katrina struck. Last week a group of Democratic senators led by Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, sent a letter urging President Bush to make this change, however belatedly. They called that step ''not only prudent, but vital to the recovery.''\n        We agree.

But that approach has its limits. Mr. Suozzi, the Nassau county executive, ran for governor last year and got smushed; now he is back where he started, presumably well positioned to learn how useful it can be to get along with others.\n        That would be a good thing, because Mr. Suozzi will need to weave a large web of cooperation and good will if he is to secure what may be the most serious and ambitious goal of his tenure: revitalizing the Hub, the sprawling wasteland in central Nassau that is now home to a decrepit sports arena, acres of blacktop, crowded roads and a host of other underperforming county assets. Mr. Suozzi has made the Hub the centerpiece of his vision for a new Nassau County, where businesses, shops, industry and new mass-transit links hum in densely arranged but well-planned spaces and provide the economic vigor that keeps the rest of the region green, clean and recognizably and lovably suburban.\n        Mr. Suozzi's vision got a boost this month when the County Legislature approved a development deal for the Hub with the Lighthouse Group, a joint venture of the billionaire Charles B. Wang and Reckson Associates Realty, Long Island's largest landlord. The project now goes to the Town of Hempstead, which controls zoning for the property and thus will exert tremendous influence over the size, scope and fate of Mr. Suozzi's dream.\n        The Republicans who run Hempstead must care very little about securing Mr. Suozzi's legacy or burnishing his reputation. But they surely care a great deal about the future of Nassau, and should recognize that Mr. Suozzi's success in making the Hub work will be their success as well. The site has languished under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and any plan that makes the Hub into a regional gem will be remembered long after all the partisan squabblers are forgotten.\n        For a while it seemed that Mr. Suozzi might be envisioning the Hub as a personal monument, after he struck a solo deal with Mr. Wang on a plan that included a colossal, highly overblown lighthouse. The current proposal has no monumental aspect, and the fact that it passed the County Legislature with a bipartisan majority, 16 to 2, suggests that people are ready to put both partisan politics aside, and figure out what will work for Nassau County.\n        If that happens, it will depend both on Mr. Suozzi's ability to be a deal maker, not a pugilist, and on Hempstead's willingness to be his partner. There is clear evidence that Mr. Suozzi has had humility drilled into him. Besides his defeat last fall, there was that embarrassing car crash when his driver ran a red light, and he vowed to slow himself down a bit. His recent campaign ad in the special State Senate election, in which he and Gov. Eliot Spitzer played a cheery Stiller and Meara in singing the praises of the Democratic candidate, Craig Johnson, was a cheery counterpart to the gloomy shrillness of the ads run by the losing Republican.\n        These are good signs, and Nassau residents should expect more of them. Mr. Suozzi has got the ball rolling on the Hub; Hempstead needs to pick it up and play.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1663206,"ids":1663206,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The sad state of the nation's libraries was driven home last week when all of the libraries in John Steinbeck's birthplace, Salinas, Calif., came close to closing. The crisis in Salinas is part of a larger picture in which financially strapped local governments have been slashing library hours and book budgets. Public officials, starting with Laura Bush, the most powerful librarian in the world, should be clamoring for greater resources for libraries.\n        The troubles in Salinas began last fall, when two referendums that would have brought in more tax money went down to defeat. The City Council responded by voting to close all three of Salinas's libraries.\n        Such a step would have made Salinas, a farming community that was the site of some of Cesar Chavez's biggest drives to organize farmworkers, the largest city in the nation without a library. Money has since been raised, and Salinas has backed down from the closings, but the libraries' situation remains precarious.\n        There have been many library cutbacks across the country that have gotten far less attention. Detroit has slashed library services, and the library in Bedford, Tex., has closed its doors for at least six months. The New York Public Library's services were cut substantially after the Sept. 11 attacks, and have come back only recently.\n        As globalization takes hold, American workers have more competition than ever before from well-educated, hard-working people in places like India and China. For the United States to maintain its standing and its standard of living, it needs to make a greater commitment to books, literacy training, materials on English as a second language, and all of the other services libraries provide.\n        Congress should make libraries a higher priority. But even if it does, most of the money for libraries will still be raised at the state and local level, where the competition for budget dollars is intense.\n        Mrs. Bush, who is a librarian, has quietly supported greater federal spending on libraries and started a small foundation for libraries. But she would be doing a real service if she spoke out more forcefully to encourage states, local governments and private donors to give libraries the resources they need. Second terms are a time when occupants of the White House usually think about their legacies.

California's secretary of state announced his resignation this month amid charges that his office spent federal money on Democratic Party politics, and the National Association of Secretaries of State passed a resolution allowing its members to continue their partisan activities. There is an urgent need to fix this mess; if election officials won't do it, Congress must act to protect the integrity of federal elections.\n        Kevin Shelley, California's secretary of state, has long been a hero for the important work he did in fighting to make electronic voting trustworthy. But he came under federal and state investigation after a state auditor's report raised questions about consultants paid with federal money who attended fund-raisers and a state delegation meeting for the Democratic National Convention.\n        Mr. Shelley's downfall comes after an election in which secretaries of state appeared to be routinely using their power for partisan ends. Kenneth Blackwell of Ohio was arguably the worst offender, serving as co-chairman of the Bush-Cheney campaign in his state while repeatedly making rulings that seemed designed to help his side.\n        There were loud protests from voters over the conduct of Mr. Blackwell and several other secretaries. But the secretaries' association recently reiterated the right of its members to wear the two hats of election manager and political partisan. Kentucky's secretary of state told The Associated Press that ''if the voters think we are being too partisan, they can kick us out of office.'' That isn't good enough. By that logic, there should be no ethics laws for any elected officials.\n        To make matters worse, the secretaries of state passed a resolution calling on Congress to dissolve the Election Assistance Commission, the federal agency formed after the 2000 election to upgrade the mechanics of voting. The commission has not been as effective as it should be, but it has an important role to play. Dissolving it would send precisely the wrong message about the nation's commitment to fix the substantial flaws in the election system.\n        There is a strong federal interest in keeping state election officials impartial, because they count the votes in federal elections. If secretaries of state will not promise to keep out of partisan politics, Congress should require them to. Senator Frank Lautenberg is introducing a bill, known as the Federal Election Integrity Act, that would do just that.

It is the first major reduction in the incidence of a malignancy that strikes more than 200,000 American women every year -- and kills some 40,000 annually.\n        Researchers from the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and other institutions reported that the incidence of all types of breast cancer fell a stunning 7 percent in 2003 -- the latest year for which statistics are available -- from the year before. This was the first such decline after persistent rises for several decades and a leveling off from 1998 to 2002. The researchers estimate that 14,000 fewer women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003 than in the year before.\n        The most plausible explanation is that women by the millions abandoned or sharply cut back their use of hormone therapy. For many years hormones -- which have been widely used to treat the symptoms of menopause -- had also been hyped by the pharmaceutical industry as an elixir to ward off the ravages of aging. Overly enthusiastic doctors also championed hormone therapy as a way to prevent or mitigate heart disease, Alzheimer's, severe depression and urinary incontinence -- none of which turned out to be true.\n        But in mid-2002, a study of the effects of hormones on thousands of women had to be halted after it became clear that prolonged use of a popular hormone combination caused an increase in breast cancer, heart attacks, strokes and blood clots.\n        Women abandoned the hormone pills in droves, and almost immediately, the incidence of breast cancer began to fall. As Gina Kolata reported in yesterday's Times, rates of the most common form of breast cancer -- tumors that are fueled by estrogen -- dropped a startling 15 percent from August 2002 to December 2003.\n        The researchers hypothesize that tiny tumors in the breast, when deprived of the hormones that fueled them, stopped growing or at least grew more slowly, leaving them too small to be detected on mammograms. It is also possible that, with their hormones cut off, some tumors shrank or even disappeared. Other factors, like a slight dip in mammography screening to detect tumors and use of drugs that are known or thought to slow breast cancer, might have played a small role in reducing the numbers, but they were deemed too inconsequential to explain the results.\n        The great unknown is what will happen in the future. If tumor growth was simply slowed, not stopped, the tumors may become detectable as time goes on. But hormone therapy has continued to decline, so the drop in breast cancer is apt to continue. A study in California found that a sharp decrease in breast cancer incidence in 2003 was followed by a slower but continued drop in 2004, a harbinger, perhaps. of what national statistics will show next year.\n        Further analyses will be needed to identify all possible reasons for the decline of breast cancer incidences. If the hypothesis holds up that the drop in hormone use is the main cause, as seems likely, it should persuade even more women to curb their use except when absolutely necessary. Meanwhile, breast cancer incidence will remain high, underscoring the need for more ways to prevent this dreaded disease.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1796013,"ids":1796013,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The sordid Mark Foley controversy has diverted public attention from another major Washington ethics scandal -- the influence peddling involving the disgraced former superlobbyist Jack Abramoff. That's good news for the Bush administration, given freshly heightened suspicion that its dealings with Mr. Abramoff and his sleazy K Street operation were far cozier than it is willing to admit.\n        The White House has consistently played down the ties key officials like Karl Rove had with Mr. Abramoff, who pleaded guilty last January to conspiring to bribe public officials. But the administration has declined to publicly provide detailed answers or grant full access to relevant documents needed to establish the truth.\n        A newly released report, prepared with unusual bipartisan backing by the House Government Reform Committee, paints a different reality. It reveals that between January 2001 and March 2004, Mr. Abramoff and members of his staff had some 485 contacts with key White House officials, including at least 10 direct contacts between Mr. Abramoff and Mr. Rove. Billing records and e-mail messages unearthed by the committee indicate that Mr. Abramoff and his colleagues spent nearly $25,000 on meals and tickets for White House officials.\n        The report belies Mr. Rove's description of Mr. Abramoff as merely a ''casual acquaintance.'' An assistant to Mr. Rove, Susan Ralston, who resigned on Friday, had formerly worked for Mr. Abramoff. The report suggests that she sought Mr. Abramoff's help to obtain seats for Mr. Rove and his aides at popular sporting events, and often acted as a conduit, passing messages between the lobbyist and top White House officials, including Mr. Rove and Ken Mehlman, the current chairman of the Republican National Committee who was then a senior White House political strategist.\n        Indeed, it appears that Mr. Rove sat with Mr. Abramoff in the lobbyist's box seats for an N.C.A.A. basketball playoff game in 2002, an occasion Mr. Abramoff memorialized in an e-mail message to a colleague. ''Told me anytime we need something just let him know through Susan.''\n        It is plain that Mr. Abramoff had unusual access. As for his effectiveness, Mr. Abramoff rated the results as ''mixed.'' But he scored some important victories. In 2002, for example, the administration made the unusual decision to release $16.3 million to a Mississippi tribe Mr. Abramoff represented, notwithstanding the Justice Department's opposition to the project. The role campaign gifts and contacts between Mr. Abramoff and Mr. Mehlman may have played in this action is a matter warranting close scrutiny by prosecutors, and further digging by the committee.\n        As Tom Davis of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the committee, and Henry Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat, take pains to note, their report is based on documents that were provided under subpoena by Mr. Abramoff's firm and, for the most part, tell just one side of the story. The White House spin is that Mr. Abramoff had a well-known affinity for exaggerating the impact of his lobbying efforts. If so, full disclosure of relevant records by the White House could help support that claim. Meanwhile, the idea that Mr. Abramoff exerted no influence with the administration seems about as believable as Mark Foley's early claim that his only interest in 16-year-old pages was ''mentoring.''","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1801357,"ids":1801357,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The space agency's finest scientific instrument escaped a death sentence yesterday when Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, approved a shuttle mission to service and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope. It was a brave call, since repairing the Hubble will put the shuttle at greater risk than a typical mission to the International Space Station. It was also a welcome sign that NASA is willing to go the extra orbital mile to support superb science, even while it squanders large sums on completing the space station to perform research that can't begin to compare with the Hubble's in importance.\n        For a decade and a half, the Hubble has made discoveries that have helped revolutionize our understanding of the universe. Its typical role is to pick up a hint from ground-based telescopes and then use its unparalleled vantage point above the atmosphere to probe deeply into some puzzling phenomenon. The Hubble has peered farther into space and farther back in time than any other instrument. It has discovered more than 500 proto-galaxies that emitted light when the universe was in its formative stages, confirmed the jaw-dropping discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and helped establish the rate of expansion and the age of the universe.\n        A panel of distinguished astronomers judged that the Hubble ''has arguably had a greater impact on astronomy than any instrument since the original astronomical telescope of Galileo.'' And what made all of this possible was NASA's willingness to refurbish the Hubble every few years to replace depleted batteries and gyroscopes and install new equipment. Many experts believe that when the Hubble gets two state-of-the-art instruments on the next servicing mission in 2008 it will be more capable than ever, ready to peer farther back into a time when galaxies were forming and the universe was emerging from darkness into light.\n        The threat to the Hubble's future came unexpectedly from NASA itself in early 2004. In a decision that can only be described as myopic, Sean O'Keefe, the administrator at the time, unexpectedly canceled the next servicing mission, ostensibly because of safety concerns after the Columbia disaster. But the underlying reason was almost certainly that a Hubble mission would be a diversion from the administration's priorities to complete the space station and then send astronauts back to the Moon and eventually Mars. Only intervention by Congress and the National Academy of Sciences kept the death sentence at bay.\n        Now Mr. Griffin has concluded that the mission can be conducted safely, especially since NASA has developed new inspection and orbital repair techniques, and that the mission will not interfere with other space priorities. A Hubble mission may be marginally more risky than a flight to the space station, but that risk is surely worth taking for the scientific payoff.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1832259,"ids":1832259,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The state of politics in the 40th District in Brooklyn is, frankly, a mess.

Ms. Clarke and her mother, Una Clarke, who previously held the council seat, enthusiastically backed his campaign.\n        But it turns out that Mr. Eugene, who hoped to become the Council's first elected Haitian-American, had failed to satisfy a basic legal requirement: that he be a resident of the district on election day. This was an unforgivable mistake, reflecting incompetence in either the candidate or his campaign. It also means that the district will have to vote all over again in a second special election.\n        Mr. Eugene admits that he did not live in the 40th district during the campaign. But he says the law only required him to establish residency in the district before the date on which the city's Board of Elections certified the results. The Board did so last Thursday. But by then, the state Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo, had shot down Mr. Eugene's convenient reading of the law. Mr. Cuomo ruled that to be declared a winner, a candidate had to be a resident of the district on election day.\n        Mr. Eugene says the law was unclear. But if he believed that, would he not have been wiser to establish residence well in advance instead of leaving everything to the 11th hour, and risking a different reading of the law? Mr. Eugene would do everyone a favor by sitting out the next election.\n        The 40th District -- which includes, among other areas, parts of Flatbush and Crown Heights -- is especially in need of competent representation. It suffers from an elevated school dropout rate, as well as high rates of unemployment and of H.I.V., the AIDS virus.\n        Mr. Eugene's mistake was also costly for taxpayers. Ten candidates campaigned for the office in frigid weather, including others who were not residents. Many voters dug into their meager personal budgets to contribute to the various campaigns. More than $300,000 in public matching funds was awarded to several candidates as part of the campaign finance program. The city's Board of Elections spent another $350,000 to print ballots, put machines in place and provide information to voters. More money will now be required for a do-over, the first anyone can remember in this city. It should be the last.\n        The only real value in this fiasco is that it exposes the weaknesses in the residency law and the need to make common-sense changes in that law to require more accountability from candidates. At a minimum, candidates should be required to live in their district before they even begin their campaign to represent it. Such a reform would produce candidates more committed to serve their neighbors, and discourage opportunistic outsiders.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1744037,"ids":1744037,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The steady erosion of the nation's clean air laws under the Bush administration has inspired Roy Cooper, North Carolina's attorney general, to adopt an unusual legal strategy to force out-of-state power plants to stop sending air pollution into his state. In late January, Mr. Cooper asked a federal court to declare air pollution from 11 power plants owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority in Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky a ''public nuisance'' under common law.\n        The suit seeks no monetary damages. It simply asks the court to order the T.V.A. to install up-to-date emissions controls on the sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury from its coal-fired power plants. These pollutants kill trees; poison streams; create haze in national parks, like the Great Smoky Mountains park; and contribute heavily to respiratory illnesses.\n        T.V.A., a government-owned authority, is among the country's largest power producers and, therefore, one of its biggest polluters. The company has spent heavily on controls -- partly as a result of a consent decree in the 1970's -- but both Mr. Cooper and environmental groups believe it can do more.\n        Mr. Cooper called the public lawsuit a ''last resort'' arising from the administration's weakening of longstanding regulatory tools that had been used to make individual plants clean up their emissions. One of these, known as New Source Review, requires older power plants that are being significantly upgraded to include modern pollution controls in the improvements. The administration's rewrite, now under court challenge, has effectively halted lawsuits under the rule.\n        The Environmental Protection Agency also gave Mr. Cooper the cold shoulder when he tried to invoke a section of the act that allows states to seek relief from out-of-state pollution.\n        The administration argues that a broad new regulation approved last year, known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule, will eventually force the utilities to reduce pollution. The rule, which will cap emissions in 28 states east of the Mississippi, should eventually help clean the air. But it has a relaxed timetable and, because it lets utilities decide which plants to spend their money on, provides no guarantees that the dirtiest plants most harmful to North Carolina will ever be cleaned up. It is, in short, no substitute for the plant-by-plant approach called for by the framers of the original Clean Air Act.\n        Mr. Cooper's resourcefulness is to be admired. Some legal experts give his unorthodox strategy a good chance. This suggests that the T.V.A. would do well to reach an amicable agreement.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1670068,"ids":1670068,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The stock market has been a scary place lately: new yearly lows followed by big daily gains, then more lows and so on. While no one fully understands these gyrations, we do know that markets become skittish when fundamentals are out of whack. There's arguably no more fundamental imbalance these days than the United States' low national savings -- the amount Americans save minus the amount the government borrows. But don't expect to hear our nation's leaders talk about it.\n        From 2002 through 2004, the rate of national savings was lower than at any time since 1934. This year, savings are once again off to an anemic start. That's a problem for stocks because the market looks forward, and a lack of national savings means that both the private and government sectors must borrow to pay for all of the things we wish for ourselves, our progeny and our society, like modern industrial plants, secure retirements, good education and better health care. If current trends continue, the United States will borrow an unprecedented $1 trillion this year alone, mostly from abroad, a sum that is reflected in the nation's huge budget and trade deficits.\n        Any sane market analyst has to wonder how long that can last, and such underlying angst intensifies market swings.\n        How we got to this point is now sadly familiar. The biggest culprit is the Bush administration's profligacy, with tax cuts the most glaring driver of the swing from budget surplus to budget deficit over the past four years. Currently, the deficit offsets most of the economy's net private savings.\n        Individuals also do not save enough, as reflected in the widespread inadequacy of retirement savings. Some argue that the amount of personal savings is understated because it does not take into account the increase in housing values, which has many homeowners feeling flush. But elevated home values do not add to national savings.\n        Such wealth is not converted into cold hard cash until houses are sold, and at that point the money flowing into the sellers' pockets is simply money that is flowing out of the buyers' pockets. No new wealth is created unless a seller saves the windfall -- which is generally not the case in today's consumer economy. Instead, sellers increase their purchasing power, while the saving rate declines and the country as a whole becomes poorer. The uncomfortable reality is that saving is possible only by deferring today's consumption, not by spending freely while one's house appreciates.\n        The most powerful way to increase national savings is to cut the budget deficit. To do that, President Bush and his allies in Congress must defer the gratification they would derive from showering more tax cuts on the affluent. Lawmakers should also refocus their efforts on increasing personal savings. For decades the emphasis has been on granting tax incentives to savers, and for decades the amount of personal savings has trended downward. Congress should instead encourage all employers to improve the structure of retirement savings plans in ways that have demonstrably increased participation, including automatic enrollment upon hiring and the automatic allocation of employee contributions.\n        The alternative is economic decline. The markets are right to be skittish.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":5,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1777602,"ids":1777602,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The stock market went a little manic last week. On Wednesday, prices surged, buoyed by investors' belief that rising inflation would not (necessarily) compel the Federal Reserve to continue in its two-year-old campaign to raise interest rates. On Thursday and Friday, prices dropped, as those same investors apparently changed their minds. But there's no such ambiguity when it comes to the impact of inflation on consumers, especially middle- and low-income people. It hurts.\n        The Labor Department reported this week that consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in June. That was half the pace of May, but the slowdown may be short-lived, since the decrease last month was due largely to lower energy prices, which have since risen. And even with June's relatively tame cost-of-living figure, inflation over the past year came in at 4.3 percent. Because middle- and low-income Americans spend a larger share of their incomes on essentials that tend to rise the most -- like gasoline, food, rent and utilities -- economists generally assume that inflation is more painful for them than for more affluent Americans.\n        The pain of higher prices is intensified by stagnating wages. Despite the recent uptick in wage growth, once inflation is taken into account, hourly wages for most American workers fell 0.6 percent from June 2005 to June 2006. Only by working more hours have families been able to keep this year's pay on a par with last year's. But running faster may be an increasingly futile strategy. The new Labor Department figures show that inflation has also been accelerating in the last three months. If price increases were to maintain that recent pace, the annual inflation rate would climb to 5.1 percent.\n        Wall Street is hoping for a pause in interest rate increases, because that would presumably spur economic activity, which would be good for stocks. And investors aren't the only ones who stand to gain. A pause would also help workers because faster growth could further tighten a labor market that has just recently shown signs of tightening, leading -- finally -- to some real gains in wages.\n        There's a knee-jerk reaction that says a rate-increase pause in the face of growing wages is a recipe for still more inflation. That's an overly narrow view. Throughout the current economic recovery, now nearly five years old, wages have never been the source of inflationary pressure. Moreover, wage gains do not automatically lead to higher prices. Higher wages could be absorbed by higher productivity or by a narrowing of the stupendous profit margins that corporations have enjoyed for years.\n        Whether Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will see fit to pause is an open question. What is known is that most working Americans have been stuck for years in an economy that has brought higher prices and stagnating wages.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1821935,"ids":1821935,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The sudden vacancy in the 7th State Senate District has caused both parties to leap in with guns blazing. When the Republican incumbent, Michael Balboni, quit to join the Spitzer administration as chief of homeland security, the race to succeed him became instantly nasty and hugely expensive.\n        That's because so much is at stake beyond just a single seat in northwest Nassau County -- control of the Senate, for instance, where the Republican majority has been nearing the vanishing point, as well as the reform agenda of Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who broke with a tradition of gubernatorial nonaggression in such races to appear in an ad hailing the Democratic candidate, Craig Johnson, as an ally in his crusade to fix Albany.\n        Mr. Johnson, who was elected to the Nassau Legislature in 2000 after the death of the incumbent -- his mother, Barbara -- is challenging Maureen O'Connell, who became the Nassau County clerk a little over a year ago and now wants to return to Albany, where she had served as an assemblywoman since 1998. With very little time to campaign -- the special election is on Feb. 6 -- both sides are running at a frantic pace.\n        Their ads are studies in negativity, with Mr. Johnson's campaign accusing Ms. O'Connell of being an anti-choice extremist on reproductive issues, and Ms. O'Connell running a preposterous spot showing a woman tied to railroad tracks about to be mowed down by a train. The train represents taxes, taxes, taxes, specifically the 19-percent increase that County Executive Thomas Suozzi pushed through the Legislature in his first term as part of his utterly sensible -- and successful -- effort to rescue Nassau's finances from decades of Republican misrule.\n        Of the charges being hurled back and forth over the airwaves, we find Mr. Johnson's the more persuasive. Ms. O'Connell does have a troubling record on choice, having taken stands in Albany -- like voting against an emergency contraception bill when it was in committee -- that infringed on women's reproductive rights.\n        Ms. O'Connell's claims that Mr. Johnson is a taxing madman are, by contrast, unfounded. The Suozzi tax plan he voted for was a prudent and responsible response to a fiscal mess. He has also assembled a credible record on other issues, including open space preservation.\n        This race is, though, about something larger -- which is the reason the eyes of the whole state are on it. Governor Spitzer will need the cooperation of the Republican-dominated State Senate if he is going to make progress on the ambitious reform agenda he has laid out. Mr. Johnson has vowed to be his ally in the coming battles, while Ms. O'Connell is likely to give reinforcement to the Albany status quo.\n        For voters who have hopes that Ms. Spitzer will succeed in fixing Albany, as we do, Mr. Johnson is the obvious choice. We enthusiastically endorse him.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1818040,"ids":1818040,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The tax system in the United States is supposed to mitigate inequality. But a recent report by Congress's budget agency provides fresh evidence that Bush-era tax cuts have done more to reinforce inequality than to redress it.\n        The agency found that in 2004, the latest year for which comprehensive data were available, the top 1 percent of households pocketed 14 percent of total after-tax income in the United States, up from 12.2 percent in 2003. That increase, the third largest in one year since the agency started keeping track in 1979, works out to an extra $128 billion. And yet despite that hefty gain, the effective federal tax rate of the top 1 percent decreased slightly.\n        In contrast, the share of after-tax income going to households in the middle of the income distribution fell to 15 percent in 2004, down from 15.4 percent in 2003 -- the equivalent of a $29 billion loss. In that time, the share of their income going to federal taxes stayed about the same.\n        One of the reasons the rich are getting so much richer than everyone else is that investment income is highly concentrated among the richest Americans and has grown robustly through much of the Bush years -- unlike wages and salaries. But the rise in investment income hasn't caused rich Americans' income taxes to rise substantially because -- thanks to the tax cuts of 2003 -- investments are now taxed at about the lowest rates in the code.\n        Another reason for the after-tax advance of upper-income Americans is that an ever larger share of their salaries escapes the payroll tax that pays for Social Security benefits. The annual amount of income subject to the tax -- now $97,500 -- has been adjusted upward each year since 1982, in line with the increase in average wages. But as pay raises at the top of the income scale have increasingly exceeded the average wage gain, incremental adjustments in the wage cap have been inadequate. In 1982, only about 10 percent of all wages escaped the tax. Today, that figure is estimated at 15 percent. The administration has yet to call for raising the cap, though doing so is a matter of simple fairness.\n        Unfortunately, with the administration having abandoned fiscal prudence for the past six years, it's practically inevitable that inequality will worsen. The bill for the deficit-financed tax cuts of the Bush era will arrive in the years to come. It's likely that the costs will be borne by all, even though most of the benefits have accrued to the few.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1651474,"ids":1651474,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The tension between suburban-style big-box stores and the deeply urban environs of New York City has already spawned a raft of land-use squabbles. But now the biggest box of them all, Wal-Mart, has its eye on a site in Queens. As it argues its case, the world's largest retailer may have found something it cannot discount: local concerns about traffic and the environment coupled with anger over Wal-Mart's questionable labor practices.\n        It's not that the city is totally averse to big-box stores. New Yorkers like bargains as much as anyone else, particularly if the location is right. BJ's Wholesale Club successfully built stores in Brooklyn and Queens before retreating in the face of opposition to its plans to expand into the Bronx. But traffic concerns in particular can raise the hackles of local residents who are already gridlocked for much of their waking lives. Ikea, the home-furnishing store based in Sweden, won the city's approval last October to build in Red Hook in Brooklyn, but now it is under fire over traffic and other environmental issues, and opponents have sued to have its permission revoked. The Rego Park lot where a Wal-Mart could be built as part of a larger development is just a short walk from Queens Boulevard, a traffic nightmare where some 85 pedestrians have died in the last 20 years. The area is already stuffed with high-rise rentals and co-ops and a carnival of shopping that includes the city's biggest mall. The suitability of a big-box store in that neighborhood will be weighed by the City Council Land Use Committee, which considers development plans for their impact on roads and transportation. The committee is a large hurdle such projects must negotiate, and it's where the Bronx BJ's was rejected, ostensibly over traffic worries.\n        The Council is not supposed to extend its review to things like working conditions, but it would have been hard for local politicians to ignore the outcry over the fact that BJ's is nonunion and was forced by the Department of Labor to pay workers who were owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime. Wal-Mart recently closed a store in Quebec after its workers organized the first union in the chain.\n        It makes little sense to block a store just because its employees don't have union protection when thousands of stores in the city aren't unionized -- including many of the small businesses that complain when the big discounters move in. However, when a company lobbies to win the special zoning needed to locate in New York, arguing that it will create jobs, it's natural to look at the quality of the employment offered. Wal-Mart has drawn attention to itself for practices like locking in employees overnight to prevent theft. It recently had to pay to settle charges it violated child labor laws and the chain faces an enormous sex-discrimination lawsuit. Its wages are low -- about $10 an hour in urban areas. It offers insurance coverage but priced out of reach for many; only half of its employees sign up for it. That means taxpayers ultimately bear the burden of uninsured workers who need medical care.\n        The company says it is looking at several other sites -- including, perhaps, the Bronx location that BJ's abandoned. Having already saturated the market in many parts of the country, it is determined to tap into the huge local population of shoppers. But if Wal-Mart wants to make it here, it needs to know this: In New York, it has met one tough customer.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1706049,"ids":1706049,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The treatment of the mentally disabled has fundamentally changed in recent years. The awareness that people with mental retardation or psychiatric diseases can thrive with proper therapy and attention has led doctors to abandon huge institutions and to let patients live with or near their families and get care in their communities. Electric shock therapy is used only in certain cases, with anesthesia.\n        But these reforms have bypassed Turkey, says a new report by Mental Disability Rights International, a Washington-based group that studies the treatment of the mentally disabled. The group convincingly documents, with heartbreaking photos and video, practices that it calls ''torture.''\n        Turkey's psychiatric system, the group found, makes widespread and indiscriminate use of unmodified electric shock therapy -- electroshock that is administered without muscle relaxants or anesthesia. Such therapy is frightening, painful and dangerous. Electroshock therapy can be useful against some mental diseases, but Turkey uses it on nearly a third of its patients with acute mental disorders, including children. The group quoted the director of the electroconvulsive therapy center at one hospital as saying the therapy is effective only without anesthesia because patients need to feel ''punished.''\n        Turkey should immediately ban unmodified electric shock therapy and limit the use of modified therapy to cases in which it is medically indicated. It should never be used as a first resort, and never on children.\n        It will be more difficult to reform the country's practice of warehousing retarded or mentally ill children. Investigators found giant buildings -- supposedly rehabilitation centers -- filled with children confined to their cribs or living in total inactivity. When children begin the self-destructive behaviors that are a product of such boredom and abandonment, staff members tape plastic bottles over their hands so the children cannot use them. The staff in one institution told investigators that children who cannot feed themselves are left to starve to death.\n        How can such medieval practices thrive in a modern country? One reason is that these institutions are virtually hidden. In addition, Turkey lacks a widespread culture of rights, and its citizens do not often challenge the practices of a state that has at times given them good reasons for fear.\n        Some in Turkey's establishment have complained that the report was released just before Turkey was to begin formal talks to move toward joining the European Union.

We can only hope that this delay signals that Turkish leaders are looking for a way to drop the charges against Mr. Pamuk, who is being prosecuted for ''insulting Turkish identity.''\n        In a newspaper interview last February, Mr. Pamuk referred to the Armenian genocide in 1915 during the Ottoman Empire and to the clashes between Turks and minority Kurds in Turkey since the 1980's. ''One million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it,'' Mr. Pamuk was quoted as saying. This was considered a crime punishable by up to three years in prison by some Turks, including some prosecutors.\n        The case against Mr. Pamuk -- a short-list candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature -- has called into question Turkey's willingness to embrace European political values and, by extension, its readiness to join the European Union. Over the last few years, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his governing party enacted a series of reforms that qualified Turkey -- at last -- to open official membership talks in October. Some of the reforms grant more freedom of expression. But the law still prohibits insults against the Turkish identity, the state and Turkey's founding father, Ataturk. The line between illegal insult and legal opinion is unclear.\n        As a result, dozens of people in Turkey face charges like those against Mr. Pamuk. Last month a Turkish book publisher said he faced prosecution for a book published in 1997 that included allegations of human rights violations by the security forces during fighting with Kurdish rebels in the 1990's.\n        In delaying the Pamuk trial, the judge has asked the Justice Ministry to rule on whether the case should go forward at all. The answer will say a lot about the current state of a nation that has long prized national unity above civil liberties. Many Turks oppose Mr. Pamuk's prosecution -- and that of other less prominent people on similar charges. But obviously, some do not.\n        Dismissing the case against Mr. Pamuk and clarifying the law under which he has been charged are crucial steps Turkey must take to join the European Union.

Assuming, as everyone does, that he will be found guilty of fraud and tax evasion and left in prison, let's take stock: Russia has one fewer oligarch. Most of his Yukos company, which used to pump 2 percent of the world's oil, has been gobbled up by companies connected to the state. Russia's image and the standing of President Vladimir Putin have taken a major beating because the trial had the air of politically motivated vengeance and looting. Investor confidence has been shaken. So was it worth it?\n        Since his arrest 18 months ago, Mr. Khodorkovsky has played the role of a classic victim of Russian authoritarianism, of an honest businessman victimized by a predatory regime. But the story of how the oligarchs came about is somewhat different, and in many ways, Mr. Khodorkovsky was the template for the breed. A member of the Communist Youth League when the Soviet Union began to fall apart, he quickly proved adept at taking advantage of the free-for-all that followed. He became one of the new entrepreneurs selected by Boris Yeltsin in 1995 for an outrageous deal in which businessmen were handed vast control over Russia's natural resources in exchange for financing Mr. Yeltsin's political survival. The beneficiaries became fabulously wealthy, and Mr. Khodorkovsky was arguably the most successful. At the time of his fall, Yukos was among the most respected businesses in Russia, both for its performance and its propriety.\n        Still, Russians have never made peace with the notion that a handful of men, most in their 30's, were suddenly rendered so rich and powerful. Worse, some, Mr. Khodorkovsky prominent among them, began seeking ways to translate their wealth into political power. Certainly the government has a right and an obligation to restore its authority over an economy that had fallen prey to gangster capitalism and corruption, and especially over strategic resources like oil and gas. Viktor Yushchenko, the reformist new president of Ukraine, has also made it his priority to renationalize some of the Ukrainian holdings from a handful of tycoons who secured them through shady political maneuvers.\n        But such a process can be useful only if it represents the ascendancy of law over banditry. That is especially critical in a country like Russia, where the rule of law is so little known and so badly understood. We criticized this trial not necessarily because we believe that Mr. Khodorkovsky is innocent, or that oligarchs should be immune from the law, but because it was not a fair trial, and a fair trial would have been so valuable to the development of Russia. Mr. Khodorkovsky might well have gone free because the law is so vague and inconsistent and because, in the end, it was the government that handed him his riches. But the gains for the rule of law would have been great.\n        There is still time for the judge to redeem the process with a verdict that is perceived to be just. We hope that the new Ukrainian government learns from the Khodorkovsky trial that real justice is the only way to redress injustice.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1841792,"ids":1841792,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The trouble with modernity is how efficiently it obliterates the troves of age-old knowledge otherwise known as wisdom. The good news from Palau, a Pacific island nation near the Philippines, is that some wise old ways have reasserted themselves to the great benefit of that tiny republic's fish and reefs, and the people who depend on them.\n        Under an ancient system of laws known throughout the South Pacific as tabu or kapu, rulers would forbid fishing in certain areas to let them recover from overuse. Their decisions relied on deep knowledge of seasons and of the habits of fish and plants, and were strictly obeyed by islanders, who understood that depletion of fisheries meant death.\n        Overfishing by local fishermen, commercial boats and poachers using dynamite has been as much a problem in Palau as elsewhere in the Pacific. Then elders in Ngiwal, a state of Palau, banned fishing on a small section of reef in 1994. It took only a few years for fish to return. Palau now protects 460 square miles of reefs and lagoons, and its reputation for recreational diving is unmatched.\n        In 2005, Palau's president, Tommy Remengesau Jr., issued the ''Micronesian challenge,'' calling on the region to conserve 30 percent of coastal waters and 20 percent of land by 2020. Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have created hundreds of ''no take'' zones. Meanwhile, nations in another sea are pursuing their own ''Caribbean challenge.''\n        The trend is encouraging, but there is still a lot of water to cover. It would help if the United States dove in. Hawaii's reefs and inshore waters are increasingly barren, depleted by pollution, invasive species and fishermen using things like brutally efficient gill nets to catch vast amounts of fish.\n        Hawaii's House of Representatives, pushed by the commercial fishing industry, recently passed a deplorable ''Right to Fish'' bill that is fundamentally at odds with the spirit of Palau. It erects impossible barriers against the creation of no-take zones. It would stamp out the small but growing efforts of local communities and conservation groups to adopt their own sensible fishing restrictions.\n        Native Hawaiians know all about kapu. What the lobbyists pushing the legislation are banking on is that Hawaiians will forget the usefulness of the old ways and bristle at the supposed paternalism. It would be a perverse victory for ''rights'' if such an attitude hastened the demise of a shared, precious and vulnerable resource like an island fishery.","adu_anecdote":14,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1766720,"ids":1766720,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The tuition aid programs that have historically helped tens of millions of poor and working-class Americans through college are now underfinanced and falling far short of the national need. This makes it important for the states -- and the colleges they oversee -- to be sure that the tuition aid dollars intended for needy students are being wisely spent. And that in turn means making sure that students who are accepted at college have a realistic chance of graduating.\n        All this should be common sense. But as Karen W. Arenson of The Times reported recently, colleges and their profit-making cousins are accepting students who have not graduated from high school or earned equivalency degrees. In New York, the main offenders are profit-making colleges, one of which was recently cited by state officials for a student body in which more than 90 percent of the enrollment consisted of nongraduates.\n        Profit-making colleges have become notorious for sweeping the streets for any warm bodies they can find, simply to get access to the rich flow of state and federal tuition aid. Traditional colleges accept far fewer students from this category. But the evidence suggests that even some traditional colleges may be turning to students that have not graduated for the same reasons as their profit-making counterparts -- to fill empty seats and get access to aid that they would otherwise not receive.\n        With one of the most generous tuition assistance programs in the country, New York State is especially vulnerable to abuse in this department. Gov. George Pataki was rebuffed by the Legislature recently when he tried to place limits on how aid could be used by colleges that accept students who have not graduated from high school. But the State Board of Regents, which has broad powers to oversee educational institutions, recently voted to increase supervision, not just of profit-making colleges, but of traditional colleges that accept students without high school diplomas or G.E.D.'s.\n        The new rules are yet to be completed. But they should require colleges to revamp their admissions from the ground up so that they take in only students who are capable of succeeding. That certainly does not mean shunning any student who has a less-than-perfect academic background. But colleges that take at-risk students must develop support services, modeled on successful programs elsewhere, to give them a better chance at succeeding.\n        There is no virtue attached to raising the expectations of unprepared young people and encouraging them to tackle education programs that they have little or no chance of successfully finishing. At the very minimum, students should have either a high school diploma or its equivalent -- as well as grades and basic skills test results that show them capable of performing college-level work. Without the basics, those hopeful young people will almost inevitably end up back on the streets with their student aid allotments exhausted and their lives unimproved.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1800964,"ids":1800964,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The use of annual CT scans to screen for lung cancer is either an enormous breakthrough that holds the first real promise for curing this normally lethal disease -- or an unproven tool whose real value is yet to be determined. Those are the possibilities raised by a multinational study led by researchers at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital\/Weill Cornell Medical College.\n        The new study, published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, derives strength and credibility from its large size. The researchers administered CT scans to more than 31,000 people in seven countries who were deemed at high risk of lung cancer.\n        None of the participants had any symptoms, like a persistent cough, shortness of breath or chest pains. Yet the CT scans picked up hundreds of suspicious lumps and led to a diagnosis of lung cancer in 484 participants. Most of the tumors were caught at a very early stage, when they are most curable. The vast majority were removed.\n        The results seem, on the face of it, remarkably promising. Lung cancer ordinarily kills 95 percent of its victims, and only 15 percent live for even five years after they receive their diagnosis. But in the new study, the researchers projected that 80 percent would live for at least 10 years. Of those who had early stage tumors that were removed within a month of detection, an astonishing 92 percent are expected to survive for 10 years.\n        Some cancer experts and advocates for lung cancer patients are hailing the dawn of a new era in which lung cancer will move from a disease that is usually fatal to one that is usually curable. So why do many experts have misgivings about recommending widespread CT scan screening?\n        The main problem with this study is that it did not include a control group of people who were not screened with CT scans, so there is no definitive way to be sure that those who were screened will live any longer than a group that wasn't screened. It is possible that the CT scans are detecting tiny lumps that would never have killed anyone or that removing tiny tumors early does not really lead to a longer life than removing the same tumors later. CT scans also can lead doctors to perform needless biopsies that involve sticking needles into the lungs, followed perhaps by needless surgery to remove tumors that might never have become a problem.\n        Most governmental and medical organizations that issue advice on cancer screening are expected to wait several years for the results of more definitive studies before recommending CT scans for lung cancer. Meanwhile, smokers and others at high risk will need to consult their doctors on the potential risks and benefits of getting a CT scan every year.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1837156,"ids":1837156,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The village of Greenport has come up with an intriguing model for creating affordable housing, one that seeks to level the village's badly tilted real estate playing field back in favor of regular working people. There is a dwindling number of those in Greenport, whose population of wealthy summer residents has grown significantly in recent years.\n        The idea came as part of a settlement of a long-running dispute over two acres of waterfront property that, in the ordinary Long Island scheme of things, would have been destined -- or doomed, depending on your perspective and tax bracket -- to become luxury housing for the village's increasingly Manhattan-based demographic.\n        The agreement was brokered by Mayor David Kapell, who says he is all for economic growth in his village but hates the thought of housing prices being skewed so high by rich outsiders that they force out people who live and work in Greenport year-round -- those with Main Street, not Wall Street, incomes.\n        Under the plan, the property, an old oyster-packing operation, would be redeveloped for both commercial and residential use. There would be one shop repairing and selling yachts, and another freezing and packing scallops. There would be a dozen 1,500-square-foot apartments sold at market -- i.e., luxury -- rates. And then there would be five little one-bedrooms, each 650 square feet, sold for $175,000, only to residents who live or work in Greenport full time. The residency requirement would apply to all future sales and units could not be combined into bigger ones, so -- in theory, anyway -- they would always be too small for the lofty appetites of hedge-fund managers, but just right for young teachers, firefighters or retirees.\n        Mr. Kapell, who has been in the real estate business for decades, thinks his plan would let the free market do its thing, but tweak it just enough to help the average Greenporter. This sort of idea could and should take hold across Long Island, if only communities could overcome their resistance to higher-density housing and accept the idea of giving a leg up to the dreams of ordinary Long Islanders.\n        A postscript: Greenport's tiny experiment in resisting the gentrification juggernaut is further evidence of the political distinctiveness, civil ingenuity and creative enthusiasm of Mayor Kapell, who is leaving office next month after 28 years in public life, 13 as mayor. Mr. Kapell has long been a refreshing oddity in a political landscape where the knee-jerk response to new challenges ranges from ''You can't do that'' to ''Not in my backyard'' to the all-purpose ''No.''\n        Mr. Kapell is the original ''Yes, in my backyard'' politician. He is committed to preserving Greenport's identity as a working harbor town, not a fake Ye Olde Village smelling of potpourri. He has worked aggressively to welcome new things -- a park, a carousel, an ice rink, a power plant, community patrols in red berets, affordable housing, even Latino immigrants -- and his village, once a dumpy, corrupt East End dead end, has thrived for it.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1805353,"ids":1805353,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"The voters sent a clear message last week that they do not want the far right of the Republican Party calling the shots in Washington. But President Bush has ignored the message, resubmitting a group of archconservative, underqualified judicial nominees that Senate Democrats have already said are unacceptable. With the Democrats about to take control of the Senate, it is highly unlikely that these men will be confirmed. But the renominations suggest that when it comes to filling judgeships, Mr. Bush is still not looking for either excellence or common ground.\n        The four most controversial nominees that President Bush resubmitted are ideological in the extreme. William Myers III, a longtime lobbyist for mining and timber interests, would no doubt use his position on the San Francisco-based United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to gut environmental laws. William Haynes II, who helped develop the administration's torture and ''enemy combatant'' policies as the top lawyer for the Pentagon, could be counted on to undermine both civil liberties and reasonable limits on executive power.\n        Terrence Boyle, a district court judge in North Carolina and a former aide to Senator Jesse Helms, has a long record of insensitivity to victims of race and disability discrimination. He would be able to pull the law in the wrong direction in these areas if he became an appeals court judge. Michael Wallace, a former lawyer for Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, has a bad civil rights record, including arguing in favor of letting Bob Jones University, which discriminated on the basis of race, keep its tax-exempt status.\n        Beyond their ideology, these nominees embody values that the American people rejected in the midterm elections. The voters were angry about the influence of lobbyists and special interests. But Mr. Myers would bring that influence onto a powerful appeals court. The voters were upset about the incompetence this administration has shown on everything from Iraq to Hurricane Katrina. But Mr. Wallace is the very rare appeals court nominee to receive a unanimous ''not qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association.\n        A fifth appeals court nominee, Peter Keisler, is likely to face stiff opposition for well-founded procedural reasons. When President Clinton tried to fill this seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Republican senators blocked him, saying the court needed only 10 judges. Since then, the court's caseload has decreased. It is unlikely that Democratic senators will allow the Republicans to fill the seat now.\n        President Bush's decision to resubmit these names could be a final sop to his far-right base. Perhaps, once this slate fails one more time, he will make more reasonable choices. Mr. Bush may have no other choice, if he wants to get any nominees confirmed in the next two years. Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, has said that ''the days of hard-right judges'' are over, and when Democrats take over in the Senate, he will be in a position to see that they are.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1836904,"ids":1836904,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The world has been discussing the genocide in Darfur for more than three years. But some 200,000 deaths later, it has yet to take effective action to force the Sudanese government to stop sponsoring the mass murder, rape, torture and forcible evictions being carried out on its orders in the region.\n        Yesterday, the United Nations Human Rights Council at last expressed its deep concern over human rights violations in Darfur. That modest advance was made possible by the welcome willingness of several African countries to set aside their usual reluctance to talk about their continent's human rights problems.\n        But in practical terms, it was only a baby step. Despite an earlier finding by the council's own investigative team that the Sudanese government ''orchestrated'' and took part in ''large-scale international crimes,'' the resolution failed to identify the Sudanese government as the author of these crimes.\n        Slow progress is also visible in the Arab League, where other leaders reportedly subjected Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, to tough questioning over Darfur at this week's summit meeting. Their voices are crucial. Khartoum cannot dismiss Arab critics as colonialists or crusaders against Islam. But it will take more than discreet conference diplomacy to end the slaughter.\n        Once again, there are reports that Sudan will allow a United Nations-African Union force in Darfur. Concerted international action, including a strong protective force, would be the best response. But until now, Sudan has done all it can to delay that. The remaining people of Darfur cannot wait much longer. It is past time for other countries to insist that Khartoum end its obstructionism, which has cost thousands of additional lives.\n        The diplomatic timidity of the handful of governments that have denounced the horrors in Darfur has been almost as frustrating as the callousness of the many that will not. The European Union, for example, has no meaningful sanctions of its own against the responsible Sudanese leaders. The United States, which has been enforcing financial sanctions against a list of companies and individuals linked to the Darfur genocide, needs to expand the list, toughen the sanctions and persuade its allies, in Europe and elsewhere, to apply similar restrictions.\n        The United Nations has repeatedly disgraced itself by its halfhearted and inadequate response to the gravest human rights challenge it has faced since it failed the same genocide test in Rwanda more than a decade ago. The Security Council, which has authorized an international force, must now see to it that it is actually dispatched. The Human Rights Council, which should focus moral pressure on the Sudanese government, holds back from doing so. And Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and his representatives have too often been taken in by Mr. Bashir's hollow assurances.\n        China and a shrinking bloc of nonaligned nations have repeatedly put the sovereign right of Sudan's rulers to annihilate minorities ahead of the international community's legal responsibility to prevent genocide and protect human rights.\n        Other international leaders need to demonstrate that they can act as well as talk, or else fine words and empty deeds will be the epitaph for the dwindling survivors of Darfur.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1673631,"ids":1673631,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The world has two big programs that fight AIDS in poor countries. One, created by President Bush, will spend more than a billion dollars in 15 hard-hit nations this year. It is a very important lifesaving initiative, but it could do even more. The pharmaceutical industry has kept it from buying cheap generic versions of AIDS medicines. And the religious right has pushed it toward abstinence-only programs and away from the people most likely to become infected: prostitutes, gays and intravenous-drug users. Fortunately, there is also the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which has been free to do the work America shuns. But its ability to continue to do so is at risk.\n        In April, the Global Fund's board set up a committee for policy and strategy that is so powerful it has been described as a shadow executive board. The fund's board is choosing a leader for the supercommittee this week, but at the moment there is one candidate: Randall Tobias, who runs Mr. Bush's AIDS program. Mr. Tobias may be approved to avoid angering the United States, the fund's largest donor, but the risk to its independence is too great.\n        Mr. Tobias did the right thing this week by quashing, at least for now, an effort by American religious conservatives to make the thousands of groups getting grants from the Global Fund sign a pledge that they oppose prostitution. Many groups would have refused to sign, not because they favor prostitution, but because they see a pledge as an ideological test that would hinder their ability to help women who are forced into sex work.\n        On many other occasions, however, Mr. Tobias has been quite willing to follow the agenda of the religious right.\n        Last fall, he approved a grant for a program run by a well-connected conservative foundation to promote sexual abstinence among African youth -- even though the evaluation panel had ruled it undeserving, The Washington Post reported in February. He has disparaged scientific evidence that condoms are effective in preventing the spread of AIDS. And Mr. Tobias, a former chief executive of the drug company Eli Lilly, has set up numerous roadblocks in the path of generic drugs.\n        If Mr. Tobias ran the policy committee, religious conservatives would have a direct channel into the Global Fund. Even if Mr. Tobias wanted to, he might not be able to resist that pressure. It is bad enough that the American program ties the hands of those fighting AIDS. It would be far worse if the Global Fund did so, too.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1641561,"ids":1641561,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"The world little noted, but at some point late last year the American search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq ended.\n        We will, however, long remember the doomsday warnings from the Bush administration about mushroom clouds and sinister aluminum tubes; the breathless reports from TV correspondents when the invasion began, speculating on when the ''smoking gun'' would be unearthed; our own failures to deconstruct all the spin and faulty intelligence.\n        The search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq may have been one of the greatest nonevents of the early 21st century, right up there with the failure of the world's computers to crash at the end of the last millennium. That Y2K scare at least brought us an updated Internet. Fear of the nonexistent W.M.D. brought us a war.\n        Even after most of the sites were searched, the places that had been identified in spy photos as sinister weapons-production sites had been shown to be chicken coops, and the scary reports about nuclear weapons ready to be detonated proved to be the fantasies of feckless intelligence analysts, die-hard supporters of the invasion insisted that something would turn up. This proves once again the difficulties of debunking hard-held convictions: Mr. Bush did such a good job selling the weapons-hunting nostrum that 40 percent of Americans recently said the weapons were there.\n        The fact that nothing was found does not absolutely, positively prove that there wasn't something there once, something that was disassembled and trucked over the border to Syria or buried in yet another Iraqi rose garden. But it's not the sort of possibility you'd want to fight a war over. What all our loss and pain and expense in the Iraqi invasion has actually proved is that the weapons inspections worked, that international sanctions -- deeply, deeply messy as they turned out to be -- worked, and that in the case of Saddam Hussein, the United Nations worked. Whatever the Hussein regime once had is gone because the international community insisted. It was all destroyed a decade ago, under world pressure.\n        This is not a lesson that many people in power in Washington are prepared to carry away, but it is what the national adventure in the reckless doctrine of preventive warfare has to teach us.\n        The findings issued last fall by the Iraq Survey Group, which concluded that the W.M.D. threat did not exist in Iraq when Mr. Bush decided to go to war, will apparently stand as its final conclusions. The Washington Post reported that the leader of the search team, Charles Duelfer, is working on some additions that will be included when the report is published in book form, but quoted an intelligence official as saying there was ''no particular news'' in the extra material. The 1,200 military men and women who were assigned to his search team are now fighting Iraqi insurgents. We hope they succeed. If they do not, large swaths of Iraq could become a no man's land, where terrorists will be free to work on W.M.D. projects and United Nations weapons inspectors cannot go to thwart them.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1820318,"ids":1820318,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"The young are leaving Connecticut in droves. According to the Connecticut Economic Resource Center, between 1990 and 2000, we lost a larger percentage of 18- to 34-year-olds than any other state, 23 percent, or more than 200,000 people.\n        One big reason is that it is becoming difficult for any person, particularly a young person, to buy a home here without having a very high salary. Rents, too, are exorbitant. The median price of a single-family home in Fairfield County was more than a half-million dollars in 2005, and monthly rents for two-bedroom apartments in the Stamford-Norwalk area on average were around $1,500.\n        The lack of affordable housing has created a huge problem for businesses who are finding fewer bright applicants. The high price of homes not only turns people away but also forces those who have jobs to live further and further from their workplace, contributing to highway gridlock and adding to Connecticut's considerable traffic woes.\n        Transportation and housing are linked. How the state handles these two issues will determine the health of the economy. The state has made a good start with transportation, earmarking billions of dollars for more trains and revamped highways. But affordable housing is a more difficult issue.\n        The state has had an affordable housing law for nearly 20 years that allows developers, under certain conditions, to bypass zoning laws to build housing without the blessing of town hall, as long as a percentage of units are low cost. But the law has largely been a failure because it infuriates local governments, enables development to take place on unsuitable sites and creates litigation. As it stands, in only 30 towns and cities does affordable housing make up 10 percent or more of existing homes. In most of the other 139 towns, affordable housing makes up 5 percent or less of housing units.\n        The nonprofit Partnership for Strong Communities, a housing advocacy group, suggests scrapping the law. It also suggests that the state help communities pay the cost of affordable housing with subsidies for infrastructure, giving communities some say in where the housing is built.\n        Proponents of a new law suggest that the state should pick up the costs of educating any additional schoolchildren as an incentive to communities that resist affordable housing because they feel it would overburden their school systems. But asking the state to entice already-wealthy towns to build housing they should have welcomed years ago seems contradictory at a time when the state can't seem to find the money to help genuinely needy communities struggling with high special education costs.\n        That said, the state cannot afford to ignore the astronomical cost of housing here and pretend that the problem will fix itself. The state needs an improved housing law, without which it faces continued economic stagnation, traffic gridlock and the loss of Connecticut's young.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1782704,"ids":1782704,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"There are a lot of goodies in the pension reform bill that Congress recently sent to the White House for President Bush's signature. But it is important not to confuse something-for-everyone with balance. The bill is an almost perfect example of Congress's inability to do anything good without tacking on some bad accommodation for special interests.\n        For instance, the bill sets reasonably strict funding requirements and higher insurance premiums for traditional corporate pensions. That's good. The most important mission of pension reform is to protect employees from being shortchanged and taxpayers from having to foot the bill for pension defaults. But in response to intense lobbying, Congress also carved out some big exceptions for ailing airlines, notably Northwest and Delta. That opens the door for other companies and industries to demand special treatment. And by creating the perception of an uneven playing field, the bill could provide yet another excuse for companies that want to get out of the pension business completely.\n        While voters may imagine that ''pension reform'' involves doing something to stop the disappearance of traditional pension plans, it means no such thing. Healthy companies are increasingly curtailing their pensions, having concluded that they are not needed to attract or retain suitable employees. There is probably little Congress could do to stop the trend, even if it wanted to.\n        The bill did begin to tackle a more solvable problem: how to make sure that increasingly popular 401(k) plans cover more people. But again, each step forward seems to have been linked to a step back.\n        A set of groundbreaking provisions clears the way for employers to automatically enroll employees in their companies' 401(k)'s, unless they specifically request to opt out. That is good because it is likely to increase savings significantly, especially among low- and middle-income workers.\n        But the bill also imperils savers by allowing for potentially biased investment advice. Previous law quite sensibly banned mutual fund companies from offering advice if their funds were among an employee's 401(k) options, but it did not give employers a legally sanctioned way to provide such advice. For the new bill, some senators had proposed protections for employers to hire qualified independent advisers. Unfortunately, at the behest of securities industry campaign donors, the House majority leader, John Boehner, fought hard for basically lifting the ban, and won.\n        In a similar vein, the bill strengthens the saver's credit, a tax incentive to help low-income people save for retirement (good), at a cost of about $10 billion through 2016. But it fails to extend the credit to some 50 million workers whose incomes are so low that they do not pay income taxes. The omission is all the more appalling given that the bill permanently increases, at a cost of about $36 billion through 2016, the already lofty before-tax amounts that high earners can stash each year in their I.R.A.'s and 401(k) accounts (bad). Raising the contribution limits benefits only 6 percent of all households, mostly those making more than $100,000.\n        Lawmakers have trumpeted the pension bill mainly because they have done so little that can conceivably be bragged about this year. But once it is signed, the new law will require careful monitoring to ensure that its special interest giveaways do not trump the public interest. And clearly, there is more work to do to help Americans who need to save for retirement.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1830984,"ids":1830984,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"There are many reasons for the long decline in the membership rolls for private sector unions, including powerful changes in the economy and the unions' past corruption scandals. And there is little doubt that federal rules and regulations for union organizing have also become increasingly hostile to labor, helping to drive unions' share of the work force down from a peak of 35 percent in the 1950s to a mere 7.4 percent today.\n        The House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would strengthen the rights of employees to form unions, and it drew an immediate veto threat from President Bush. But if Mr. Bush were, as he claims, truly concerned about rising income inequality and truly committed to improving the lives of America's middle class, he would support the legislation and urge the Senate to approve it.\n        The most significant change in the bill is known as a majority signup, which would allow employees at a company to unionize if a majority signed cards expressing their desire to do so. Under current law, an employer can reject the majority's signatures and insist on a secret ballot. But in a disturbingly high number of cases, the employer uses the time before the vote to pressure employees to rethink their decision to unionize.\n        The bill would also increase the penalty for employers who fired or otherwise discriminated illegally against pro-union employees. An employer currently found guilty of an illegal firing must pay back pay, minus whatever the fired employee might have earned at a new job -- a fine so low as to be meaningless. And the bill would require binding arbitration if a newly formed union and company management were unable to agree on a first contract after 120 days. The refusal to bargain is among the most common allegations against employers in filings to the National Labor Relations Board.\n        Some employers, like Cingular Wireless and the health care provider Kaiser Permanente, have voluntarily embraced the practice of the majority signup. But many others, represented by interest groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, remain rigidly opposed.\n        The bill's opponents charge that replacing secret ballots with the majority signup would be undemocratic. But the current system is by no means fair. The law prohibits union advocacy by employees during work hours and allows employers to ban organizers from the work place. But employers can require workers to attend anti-union presentations, and can discipline or fire those who refuse to attend.\n        In 2005, according to the most recent annual report of the National Labor Relations Board, 31,358 employees were receiving back pay after being discriminated against for their union-related activities. In research for a bipartisan Congressional commission in 2000, Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor relations professor at Cornell University, reported that 25 percent of employers illegally fired at least one employee during organizing campaigns.\n        Labor unions have a role to play in helping to fix today's economic ills -- most notably, worsening income inequality, a problem that's caused in part by unions' decline and the workers' resulting lack of bargaining power. What's needed is a Congressional drive to help Mr. Bush see this obvious connection. The Senate should take up the House bill promptly and send it to the president for his signature.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1701711,"ids":1701711,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"There has been much grumbling that Congress and the Bush administration denied the Army Corps of Engineers the money that was required to fortify New Orleans against a hurricane like Katrina. These complaints need to be pursued. Flood control is mainly a federal obligation, and the agency most responsible for it must have enough money to do the job right.\n        But there is another question worth asking: has the Army Corps made wise use of the money it has? Louisiana has received about $1.9 billion over the past four years for corps civil works projects, more than any other state. Although much of this has been spent to protect New Orleans, a lot has also been spent on unrelated water projects -- a new and unnecessary lock in the New Orleans Industrial Canal, for instance, and dredging little-used waterways like the Red River -- mainly to serve the barge industry and other commercial interests.\n        The Louisiana delegation, second to none in bringing home the bacon, is as much to blame for these skewed priorities as the corps is. Yet the reports of wasted dollars in Louisiana are consistent with the corps's historical profile. Studies by the Government Accountability Office, the National Academy of Sciences and others have documented that the agency has long inflated the economic payoffs of its projects to justify ever greater budget outlays, while underestimating the environmental damage caused by turning free-flowing rivers into lifeless canals and destroying millions of acres of valuable wetlands. This satisfies the corps's appetite for money and Congress's appetite for pork.\n        Katrina thus raises an even broader question: has the time not come, finally, to impose some real discipline on the Army Corps and its paymasters in Congress who regard it as their own cookie jar?\n        Both the present commander, Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, and his predecessor have promised internal reforms. But the lead must come from Congress, where enlightened reformers like Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold are pushing independent peer review for individual projects and other changes that might truly make a difference.\n        Unfortunately, many other senators -- not just those from Louisiana -- are powerfully addicted to corps projects and the votes they attract, especially Christopher Bond of Missouri, who controls the corps's budget and has single-handedly kept alive a nonessential barge industry on the Missouri River at great cost to the environment and taxpayers.

But the horrifying price of ignoring the problem was made clear again this week when errant Israeli tank shells crashed into a Gaza neighborhood, killing 18 people, including seven children, as they slept.\n        There is more than enough blame to go around. Militants in Gaza constantly lob crude rockets across the border. The Hamas movement -- voted into power last winter -- is refusing to even implicitly recognize Israel, although doing so would mean resumption of international aid and lessening the desperation of its own people. Hamas's military wing has called for attacks on American targets in retaliation for the Gaza deaths.\n        And even as he expressed his distress for the deaths in Gaza -- and called for an immediate meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, the moderate Palestinian president -- Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Israel would continue striking militants, and could not promise that mistakes ''may not happen.''\n        Yesterday, analysts were trying to figure out which was the most immediate danger: a new wave of terrorist attacks against Americans, the start of a full scale Israeli-Palestinian war, or a civil war between Hamas and its rival Fatah if talks on forming a unity government fail.\n        In such times, President Bush's call for ''care and restraint'' on all sides seems woefully inadequate. That is also how we would describe Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's sterile tour of the region last month. Since her return, the administration has not taken a single step to revive peace talks.\n        If there is any way out, Mr. Bush needs to pledge his prestige and the full resources of his remaining presidency to negotiating a Middle East peace. Even before Mr. Olmert visits Washington next week, Mr. Bush should send Ms. Rice back to the region to broker an immediate cease-fire.\n        She needs to insist that the Israelis restrain their offensives into Palestinian territory and cease all settlement construction. And she needs to make clear to the Palestinians that while words are important, there will be no resumption of aid until their security forces move aggressively to halt rocket and terrorist attacks against Israel.\n        We had hoped Mr. Bush and Ms. Rice would have figured out the cost of inaction and drift after last summer's disastrous war in Lebanon. Perhaps this week's return look into the abyss will stir them.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1779139,"ids":1779139,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"There is a difference between justified and smart. Israel's airstrikes against Hezbollah targets are legitimate so long as Hezbollah wages war against Israel and operates outside the control of the Lebanese government. But the air campaign is now doing Israel more harm than good.\n        A better answer to the Hezbollah problem would be an immediate cease-fire, paving the way for an international force to patrol Lebanon's southern border. That is what Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, was pushing for in Washington yesterday, and there were signs that President Bush may be finally coming around.\n        For more than two weeks, Mr. Bush has been playing for time, declining to join calls for an immediate cease-fire so that Israel can continue its military actions. Israel and the administration are right to argue that a cease-fire alone cannot provide a lasting solution. But if Washington is now prepared to exercise diplomatic leadership on behalf of Israel's security, rather than simply run interference for Israel's military operations, a cease-fire now could become the first step to a more lasting solution.\n        The glaring flaw in the administration's logic is that there is no way that even weeks of Israeli airstrikes can eliminate more than a fraction of the 12,000 rockets Hezbollah is believed to have in Lebanon. And more weeks of television screens filled with Lebanese casualties, refugees and destruction would be a propaganda bonanza for the Hezbollahs and the Hamases, and a mounting political problem for the Arab world's most moderate and pro-Western governments. Whatever a major Israeli ground offensive might achieve in military terms would have far too steep a political and diplomatic cost. Israel's 18-year occupation of Lebanon brought no lasting gains, and few Israelis are eager for a repeat.\n        What is needed, as almost everyone now agrees, is a strong international force, including well-armed units from NATO countries, to move into southern Lebanon as quickly as possible. Its mission would be to disarm Hezbollah in accordance with U.N. resolutions, thereby reasserting the sovereignty of the Lebanese government and preventing further attacks against Israel. An immediate internationally imposed cease-fire would spare Lebanese civilians from further suffering.\n        Yesterday, there were some encouraging signs of movement in this direction, with Mr. Bush sending Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice back to the Middle East for the weekend and calling for a multinational force to be dispatched quickly. A United Nations meeting to discuss such a force has now been moved up to Monday.\n        The pressure for bringing in an international force should now be coming from American diplomacy, not Israeli airstrikes. If Washington is about to come off the diplomatic sidelines to which it has foolishly consigned itself for the past two weeks, it will discover a real opportunity to help Israel's security, America's international image and pro-Western Arab governments.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1850880,"ids":1850880,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"There is a rule for judging solutions to the twin problems of energy dependence and global warming: A policy designed to solve one problem should not make the other worse. But that is a likely outcome of the many ''energy independence'' bills circulating in Congress that aim to build a whole new generation of coal-to-liquid plants to convert coal into automotive fuel.\n        These bills have already acquired an enthusiastic constituency and will be offered as amendments to what is now a relatively simple and sound energy bill designed to increase the fuel efficiency of cars and light trucks, encourage the production of biofuels and provide research and development money for the capture and storage of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.\n        There are, of course, ways to make this bill better. Senator Jeff Bingaman will offer a useful amendment to require utilities to generate a percentage of their electricity from renewable sources like wind. But there are also ways to make the bill a lot worse. One of them is to require the expenditure of billions of dollars in loans, tax incentives and price guarantees to lock in a technology that could end up doing more harm than good.\n        Coal is far and away America's most abundant fuel. It provides more than half the country's electricity. And there is no doubt that it could substitute for foreign oil, although how much and at what price is not clear. In addition, the technology to convert coal into liquid fuels is well established. But it is also true that between the production process and burning it in cars, coal-to-liquid fuel produces more than twice the greenhouse gas emissions as gasoline and nearly twice the emissions of ordinary diesel. These are terrible ratios.\n        Congressional and industry proponents of coal-to-liquid plants argue that the same technologies that may someday capture and store emissions from coal-fired plants will also be available to coal-to-liquid plants. But that deals with only half of the problem. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, coal-based automobile fuel would still be marginally dirtier than ordinary gasoline and only marginally cleaner than conventional diesel.\n        What this means is that the country would be investing billions to produce fuels that, from a global warming perspective, leave us at best treading water. That is unacceptable at a time when mainstream scientists are warning that greenhouse gases must be cut by 60 percent or better over the next half-century to avert the worst consequences of global warming.\n        Researchers at M.I.T. estimate that it will cost $70 billion to build enough coal-to-liquid plants to replace 10 percent of American gasoline consumption. A similar investment in biofuels like cellulosic or sugar-based ethanol -- which could yield substantial reductions in greenhouse gases -- would seem a lot smarter.\n        Given the dimensions of our energy problems, new ideas must be explored. But it makes little sense to shackle the country now to a coal-based technology of such uncertain promise.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1838472,"ids":1838472,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"There is at least one point on which we and the critics of Nancy Pelosi's visit to Damascus can agree: It is the White House, not the speaker of the House, that should be taking the diplomatic lead. But the Bush administration has far more appetite for scoring political points than figuring out whether talking to Syria might help contain the bloodletting in Iraq or revive efforts to negotiate peace.\n        So long as Mr. Bush continues to shun high-level discussions with this troublesome but strategically located neighbor of Israel, Lebanon and Iraq, such Congressional visits can serve the useful purpose of spurring a much needed examination of the administration's failed policies.\n        Ms. Pelosi and the five Democrats and one Republican who accompanied her are scarcely the first to raise such questions during the three years that Mr. Bush has instructed his top envoys -- and reportedly Israel as well -- to avoid negotiations with Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad. Plenty of other Republicans and Democrats have been taking similar trips and offering similar advice. They were ignored, but spared the White House's ridicule.\n        In the administration's perverse view, the only legitimate time for negotiations would be after the most contentious and difficult issues -- Syria's support for Hamas and Hezbollah, its meddling in Lebanon and open border with Iraq -- have already been resolved. Thus, what ought to be the main agenda points for diplomatic discussions have been turned into a set of preconditions designed to ensure that no discussions ever take place. As the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, Congressional representatives of both parties, this page, and many others have pointed out, Washington should be eager to raise just those issues, along with the possibility of a land-for-peace deal with Israel, directly with Syrian leaders.\n        By initiating such talks, the administration would give itself a chance of driving a wedge between Syria and Iran. That could strengthen Washington's efforts to restrain Iran's growing influence over Iraq. Further isolating Iran might also persuade Tehran that the price of its nuclear ambitions is too high.\n        Israel also has more to gain from talking directly with Syria. If it wanted to, Damascus could curb arms supplies to Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and agree to a just peace on the Golan frontier. And if Syria chose not to take these necessary steps, it would get the blame it deserved. Right now, Syria is getting a free ride by offering unconditional talks which it knows that Israel, in deference to the Bush administration, must refuse.\n        Ms. Pelosi did not help matters by claiming in Damascus that Israel was ready to talk -- an assertion that Israeli officials were quick to deny. Her job is to spur the Bush administration to pursue active diplomacy, not to attempt to conduct that diplomacy herself.

Election officials like to defend the machines by noting that they have been certified by independent testing labs. But the certification process has long been deeply flawed, and last week there was even more disturbing news -- that the leading testing lab has been unable to meet the federal government's standards.\n        Since last summer, Ciber Inc., the largest tester of voting machine software, has been unable to meet federal quality standards that will take effect later this year.\n        It is disturbing that if Christopher Drew had not reported this in The Times, the public still would not know. The Election Assistance Commission, the agency that evaluates the labs, did not reveal that Ciber fell short, and is still not saying what is wrong. Ciber, which is still working on meeting the standards, did not return our phone call.\n        Many Americans are using electronic voting machines that were certified by Ciber. Were those certifications done properly? Did whatever deficiencies Ciber has now exist then? No one is saying.\n        Since many jurisdictions, and some whole states, now use electronic voting machines that do not produce a paper record, certification is extremely important. It is one of the few ways of determining whether a machine wrongly records votes, either by accident or by design.\n        Even before the news about Ciber, certification was a troubled process. The biggest problem is that the voting machine manufacturers pay the labs to do the examination and certification. This is a conflict of interest. If a lab raises too many concerns, it risks losing a client to a more compliant competitor.\n        There is also too little transparency. The labs, which see themselves as working for the voting machine companies, do not tell the public when they find problems or what those problems are.\n        Congress should pass legislation fixing the system. The vendors should continue to pay the costs, but the government should choose and pay the labs. That would make the labs responsive to the correct customer -- the public.\n        It should also enact strong transparency rules. Voters should know how testing is done, and have full and timely access to the results. Congress should also require the Election Assistance Commission to be more open about how it evaluates the labs. If a lab falls short, the public -- which may currently be using machines certified by that lab -- should be told right away what the deficiencies are.\n        The veil of secrecy that hangs over certification is good for the companies that make voting machines and for the ones that test them.

The slump in home prices from the end of 2005 to the end of 2006 was the biggest year-over-year drop since the National Association of Realtors started keeping track in 1982. There are no reasons to believe that's the worst of it.\n        Prices fell in 73 of the nation's 149 major markets in the last quarter of 2006, compared with 45 declining markets in the third quarter, revealing a downturn that is not only deep but wide.\n        At the same time, the number of existing-home sales declined in 40 states, with precipitous drops in previously red-hot markets like Arizona, Florida, Nevada, California and Virginia.\n        On top of that, a glut of unsold homes virtually ensures that prices will fall further before sales pick up. At the end of 2006, the vacancy rate for family homes was the highest it has been since the Commerce Department started keeping records in 1956.\n        Yet it came as a shock to many economists yesterday when the government reported that construction of new homes fell in January by 14.3 percent. The consensus forecast had been for a drop of less than 3 percent.\n        The bust will slow job growth this year in construction and related industries and, with it, consumer spending. The severity of these economic side effects will depend on the strength of the overall job market and the stability of interest rates -- both of which are anybody's guess.\n        Squarely in harm's way, however, are low- and middle-income homeowners, many of whom have mortgages with rates that are due to adjust upward this year and next. With delinquencies already surging, it is inevitable that a combination of higher mortgage payments and weakening home prices will cause many homeowners to default.\n        Lenders and regulators should prepare to do all they can to help. During the housing bubble, regulators stood by as mortgages were extended to borrowers with poor or no credit and little or no money for a down payment. Now that delinquencies and defaults are rising, lending standards are being tightened dramatically. That will make it harder for many existing homeowners to refinance their loans, thus hastening defaults. Lenders and regulators must use the utmost flexibility in applying the new standards. They got marginal buyers into the homes in the first place. They should now make every effort to keep them there.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1760006,"ids":1760006,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"There is one figure in the polarizing immigration debate that people respect and treat with deference no matter what side they are on. It's the line. It's the mostly invisible, somewhat metaphorical procession of immigrants trying to enter the United States under established rules. It also refers to the orderliness that lawmakers are trying to impose upon the illegal population already here.\n        Like a sweating manager in a movie theater facing a restless crowd of ticket holders outside and a throng of others who have sneaked into the lobby, this country is struggling to control an unruly situation. The obvious answer is to fix the line. Any serious effort at immigration reform demands it.\n        An estimated three million people are waiting patiently for visas outside this country. The backlog goes back decades in some cases. The 11 million to 12 million who broke the law to get here have thus given themselves a significant leg up, and while their campaign for a path to legal status is just, granting them a privileged place in line is not.\n        The Senate's immigration bill -- the only rational proposal that stands any chance of passage in Congress -- offers illegal immigrants a route to legality, but one that will take many years. During that time, the country would adjust its formulas for immigrant visas to eliminate the backlogs. By the time the line-jumpers get their chance to become legal, the people who were legitimately ahead of them will have been taken care of.\n        It's important to remember that the visa backlog is not administrative but structural: the problem is not bureaucratic inefficiency but an overwhelming gap between demand and supply. The Senate bill would increase the limit on the number of employment-based visas issued each year to 450,000, from 140,000, through 2016. After that, the cap would shrink to 290,000. To further ease the backlog pressure, spouses and children would no longer be counted against the employment-based visa cap. The limits on visas for family members of immigrants would remain at 480,000, but a large group -- spouses and children -- would no longer count against that cap.\n        Family reunification would be worth pursuing even without the current crisis. Some people in the Philippines, to cite the extreme example, are in their second decade of waiting to be reunited with loved ones in the United States.\n        The proper goal of immigration reform is to be humane and practical without insulting people's innate sense of fairness. And if such reform removes the perverse incentives that make it more rational to enter the United States through the Sonoran Desert than through a line at a consular office, so much the better.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1844053,"ids":1844053,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"There is rare good news from the otherwise grim budget front. Majorities in both the House and Senate have voted to impose a pay-as-you-go rule, starting with the 2008 federal budget, which they plan to complete this spring.\n        ''Pay-go,'' which was abandoned in 2002, is vital to restoring budget discipline. It would require Congress to pay for new spending on entitlements, like Medicare, either by raising taxes or cutting other entitlements. It would also require legislators to make up forgone revenue from new tax cuts by raising other taxes or cutting spending.\n        There are differences, however, in the chambers' approaches to pay-go. The House's approach is better because it has no tricky escape hatches. In contrast, the Senate's version of the budget contains an amendment that would make it all too easy to sidestep the rule. For example, 60 senators would be able to pass a bill today to extend Bush-era tax cuts set to expire in 2010, claiming that the resulting revenue losses would be ''paid for'' by a budget surplus projected for 2012.\n        The amendment would pose a big temptation to game the process, with a predictably bad outcome. Even if the projected surplus materialized, it would be temporary because of looming obligations for retiring baby boomers. So, using up the surplus in advance would only guarantee more federal debt later.\n        Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has championed the amendment as a way to smooth extension of otherwise expiring middle-class tax cuts, like the child tax credit. But it could just as well be used to gut the estate tax for America's wealthiest families or to bolster tax breaks for investors. In any event, the Baucus amendment violates the whole point of pay-go, which is to stick to it in the interest of long-term budget health.\n        In coming up with a final budget bill, Democrats and Republicans alike should embrace the House's clean, tough approach to pay-go. That would ensure that any renewal of expiring tax cuts would be married to a realistic plan to pay for them, based on resources at hand rather than projections. Pay-go itself should be waived only in a real budget emergency -- as in 1993, when it was waived to extend unemployment benefits temporarily in the aftermath of a recession. Lawmakers' unrelenting desire to lock in constituent-pleasing tax cuts is not what we would call an emergency.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1825343,"ids":1825343,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"There is something maddening about the refusal of elected officials in Suffolk County to resolve the Farmingville day-laborer problem after all these years. Men have been gathering on the streets of that community, looking for work and enduring the hostility and suspicion of their neighbors, since at least 1998.\n        The problem, then as now, is simply too many men and trucks meeting in too small or awkward a space, whether a 7-Eleven parking lot or the shoulders and sidewalks of local roads. The result, then as now, is periodic eruptions of local indignation, followed by outbreaks of political opportunism. Residents complain that illegal immigrants are spoiling the harmony of the suburbs. Their elected leaders then milk that resentment for political gain, while doing nothing to solve the problem.\n        The latest grandstanding proposal is a bill in the Suffolk Legislature from Jack Eddington, a Democrat, and Joseph T. Caracappa, a Republican. It would forbid people to obstruct or loiter along county roads, specifically County Roads 83 and 16, also known in Farmingville as North Ocean Avenue and Horseblock Road, popular spots for day laborers to solicit work.\n        It would be wonderful if this were a serious public-safety measure, and not a poke to rouse the public mood in a re-election year for County Executive Steve Levy, who has built a national reputation and soaring approval ratings as an immigration hard-liner. But it so clearly isn't.\n        Mr. Eddington says he and Mr. Caracappa were motivated by concern for public safety, but he acknowledges that no empirical method was used in choosing Ocean Avenue and Horseblock Road for the crackdown, no survey done to determine where those roads might rank on the list of most dangerous county thoroughfares. He says no effort has been made to speak with the day laborers to devise a better way of doing things, or to determine what will happen when the men are pushed onto town or village roads. He seems not to be expecting a lawsuit, even though courts around the country have repeatedly thrown out anti-loitering ordinances as unconstitutional and upheld people's rights to gather and seek work in public places.\n        Someday even the most fed-up Suffolk residents -- the anti-immigrant picketers, the homeowners who want to secede from Farmingville to escape the ugly associations now sticking to that name -- will concede that problem has festered and worsened because of the people they have elected to office.\n        Other officials around the country have confronted similar day-laborer situations with far more success than those in Suffolk. They realize that the issue is a straightforward matter of traffic management and crowd control, and have marshaled resources to create hiring or ''shape-up'' sites where workers can gather safely off the streets.\n        ''Let's stop the philosophical debate and let's solve the problem,'' a sensible Long Island politician once said. ''The problem is littering, drinking in public, traffic problems, illegal housing and, more important, the exploitation of these day workers, who work hard all day and don't get paid and are discriminated against by employers and landlords and members of the general public. These centralized shape-up areas solve all those problems.''\n        Those remarks were made six years ago by County Executive Tom Suozzi in Nassau.

Ethnic and sectarian identities are hardening and violence is spiraling, as shown again in Saturday's horrific Baghdad market bombing. Iraq's new governing institutions are weak and leading politicians have a ''winner-take-all attitude'' that can only make matters even worse.\n        The intelligence agencies see ''real improvements'' in Iraqi security forces. But those gains are strictly relative and the report still finds those forces unlikely to be able to successfully battle Shiite militias in the next 12 to 18 months.\n        A good example of this problem can be found in the accounts of last week's battle between the Iraqi Army and a mysterious group of armed religious extremists outside the Shiite shrine city of Najaf. Najaf is supposed to be a showcase province for the American-trained Iraqi Army. The Pentagon chose it in December for the first symbolic handover of security responsibilities.\n        Barely a month later, in their first major battle, the Iraqis had to be bailed out by American air and ground forces. Hundreds of armed zealots had managed to set up a fortified encampment, complete with tunnels, trenches, blockades, 40 heavy machine guns and at least two antiaircraft weapons.\n        This happened just 10 miles northeast of the city at a time when hundreds of thousands of religious pilgrims and Iraq's leading Shiite clerics were headed there for annual holiday observances. A successful attack on top clerics and pilgrims in Najaf would have been disastrous.\n        The Iraqis' next mistake was sending only one army battalion and some police to raid this armed camp after its belated discovery. Government forces were quickly surrounded and called in American air support. Still pinned down, the Iraqis had to summon American ground support as well before they could advance on the camp.\n        This less-than-impressive performance by a supposedly top-of-the-line Iraqi Army division has grave implications for President Bush's new Baghdad security drive, in which an additional 17,000 or so American troops are supposed to work in tandem with a much larger Iraqi force.\n        Perhaps the Iraqi security forces will improve over the next 18 months. But as the intelligence estimate also makes clear, the only real hope for Iraq lies in a bold reversal of course by Iraqi politicians that puts national reconciliation ahead of sectarian advantage. Mr. Bush needs to get serious about demanding such a change, including enforceable deadlines for overdue steps like eliminating militia supporters from the police, ending vengeful anti-Baathist measures targeting the Sunni middle class, and guaranteeing the fair allocation of oil revenues.\n        Otherwise, Iraq seems headed over the cliff.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1829698,"ids":1829698,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"There were so many reasons to be appalled by President Bush's decision to detain people illegally and subject them to mental and physical abuse. The unfolding case of Jose Padilla reminds us of one of the most important: mistreating a prisoner makes it hard, if not impossible, for a real court to judge whether he has committed real crimes.\n        Mr. Padilla is a former Chicago gang member whose arrest in 2002 was touted by the Bush administration as the disruption of a high-level plot by Al Qaeda to set off a ''dirty bomb'' in the United States. Mr. Padilla was held without charge for three years and eight months in a Navy brig, his windows blackened, his every move watched. Then, rather than defend its actions before the Supreme Court, the White House declared a year ago that Mr. Padilla was no longer an illegal combatant, transferred him to civilian custody and filed conspiracy charges that have nothing to do with dirty bombs.\n        Yesterday, Judge Marcia Cooke of the Federal District Court in Miami ruled against Mr. Padilla's defense lawyers, who argued that his abusive confinement was so traumatic that he could not assist them in a trial. They had wanted to send Mr. Padilla to a hospital for treatment first.\n        That still leaves the far bigger question of whether Mr. Padilla was tortured, as he has claimed. For there to be a trial, Judge Cooke will have to rule that Mr. Padilla was not tortured, and she made a point of saying yesterday that her ruling on his competence was not a judgment on the torture claim.\n        At one point in the mental competency hearing, a prosecutor wanted to introduce what he said was a Qaeda manual instructing captured operatives to claim torture even if none had occurred. Judge Cooke refused, pointing out that there was no evidence that Mr. Padilla had ever heard of the manual, much less studied it. The government has yet to show evidence that Mr. Padilla was even a member of Al Qaeda.\n        The government's arguments at the hearing sounded ridiculous and shameful. Prosecutors said Mr. Padilla always seemed fine to his jailers, but it was his jailers who did things like standing on his bare feet with boots so they could shackle him. The brig psychologist testified that he had spoken to Mr. Padilla only twice, once when he was first detained, and two years later -- through a slit in his cell door.\n        When a psychologist testified for the defense that Mr. Padilla was ''an anxiety-ridden, broken individual,'' the prosecution said her tests were invalid -- because the jailers had kept Mr. Padilla handcuffed throughout.\n        We will probably never know if Mr. Padilla was a would-be terrorist. So far, this trial has been a reminder of how Mr. Bush's policy on prisoners has compromised the judicial process. And it has confirmed the world's suspicions of the United States' stooping to the very behavior it once stood against.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1769625,"ids":1769625,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"There's a barely concealed wish among many old Mideast hands these days to just walk away from the steadily deteriorating Israeli-Palestinian situation.

It can make plain to the Hamas-led government of the Palestinian Authority that if it means to become the legitimate international voice of the Palestinian people, and a true government in the community of nations, it will have to accept the minimal international ground rules already in place. These include renouncing terrorism, acknowledging Israel's existence as a sovereign nation and abiding by formal agreements previously signed by lawful Palestinian negotiators.\n        Those are ground rules that have already been accepted by Egypt and Jordan and by the Arab League as a whole in its 2002 Beirut peace initiative. They need to be accepted by Hamas, but not as some kind of ideological concession. Hamas must see them as an admission ticket to the real world, a necessary rite of passage in the progression from a lawless opposition to a lawful government.\n        Hamas has repeatedly heard this demand from the United States, Europe and Israel, and has repeatedly ignored it, even when it has been backed by halts in vitally needed economic assistance. Hearing it from Arab and Islamic neighbors, in the form of friendly persuasion, would be harder for Hamas to dismiss. It also could prove easier for Hamas to accommodate.\n        This page has not hesitated to call on Washington, as Israel's most important ally, to encourage Israeli leaders to keep the door open to an eventual negotiated peace.

George E. Pataki in 1998 to convert the huge Manhattanville Bus Depot in West Harlem into a center where a new generation of buses would be fueled with compressed natural gas. The conversion was to have been part of a broader effort to clean up the agency's fleet of 4,512 buses by gradually replacing the oldest diesel buses with natural-gas vehicles and with diesel-electric hybrids.\n        Instead, the depot will continue to house old diesel buses, and local residents are furious. Five of the six active Manhattan bus depots are in poorer neighborhoods north of 96th Street, and Mr. Pataki's promise seemed to offer some relief from a diet of diesel fumes.\n        Meanwhile, the agency will shift new purchases from natural-gas buses to hybrids. (There are 346 transit agency natural gas buses on the streets now, and 126 hybrids; new orders will be hybrids.) The agency argues that hybrids do not require the special compressors and fueling stations that natural-gas buses do. And hybrids are, in fact, almost as clean as the natural-gas buses.\n        But they also cost as much as $150,000 a bus more. This means that the money originally allocated for 120 new natural-gas buses and 55 extra-long clean-diesel buses will buy only 100 hybrids -- leaving 75 of the filthy old diesels on the street. This, and the backsliding on his pledge, surely merit Mr. Pataki's attention.\n        The bad news on diesels was followed by the disheartening revelation that a new city law governing heavy-duty diesel engines on construction equipment could be undercut by weak regulations drawn up by the city's Department of Environmental Protection. Approved by the City Council in early 2003, the law requires all city-owned equipment -- as well as bulldozers, backhoes and the like belonging to private contractors working on city projects -- to use low-sulfur diesel fuel and catalytic converters to capture harmful emissions.\n        But the regulations that carry out the law are nowhere near as plain as the law itself. For example, contractors may choose a superefficient piece of control equipment that costs $12,000 and captures 95 percent of the pollutants, or a $2,500 version that captures only 25 percent. This invites confusion and backsliding, and is a very good reason for the mayor and the City Council to intervene and make sure the regulations fulfill the good intentions of what ranks among the most progressive clean air laws in the country.\n        On a more positive note, the City Council is considering bills that would extend the new restrictions to garbage trucks and other city-owned vehicles. These measures deserve swift approval. But as the city moves forward, it should also attend to the unmet promises left behind.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1685109,"ids":1685109,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Thirteen years is a long time to get a pass. A 1992 Supreme Court decision has exempted Internet retailers from the obligation to collect most sales taxes on the grounds that it would be unduly burdensome. Back then, the country's thousands of state and local taxing jurisdictions all had differing rules.\n        But times have changed, and the law of the land should, too. Last week, 18 state tax collectors met in Chicago to announce an interstate agreement establishing uniform sales tax rules. Starting in October, the group will offer free software that will allow any business to easily collect the required taxes online.\n        The states' demonstration project will drive home the point that online sales-tax collection can be done nationwide. Many retailers already collect the taxes. Now Congress should step up and pass a law overturning the court's exemption in states that have streamlined their tax systems. That would allow hard-pressed states to take in roughly $20 billion a year in annual sales tax revenue that is rightfully theirs, and perhaps much more, depending on the growth in online shopping. It would also help level the playing field between local and online retailers.\n        No one in Congress has proposed legislation yet, but Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, and Senator Michael Enzi, a Wyoming Republican, are working on the issue. Still, anti-taxers are already grousing. Among their complaints is that collecting sales taxes online would represent a tax increase, which they oppose on principle. That's disingenuous. Online sales have always been taxable. But it's impossible for states to collect any sales tax directly from shoppers unless the shoppers voluntarily send in the tax. For the tax to be enforceable, it must be collected by retailers.\n        A related objection is that federal legislation should not be used to resolve a state-tax issue. That's totally off the point. The only way to address the Supreme Court ruling is for Congress to pass a federal law.\n        As if sensing the hollowness of those arguments, Web merchants are already gearing up for the day when they'll be required to collect sales tax. The New York Times reported last week that eBay and Amazon were duking it out over the level of online sales at which tax collection should apply. An eBay spokesman quoted in the article said businesses selling ''in the range of $5 million'' should be exempt from any collection obligation. Noting that a company doing $5 million in online sales is hardly a mom-and-pop, Amazon says that if there is an exemption, it should be much more limited. We don't see why any business should be exempt.\n        Lawmakers should not become distracted. Sales tax collection by online retailers is an idea whose time is way overdue.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1782671,"ids":1782671,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"This is a lament on behalf of New York City voters. Primaries are coming up on September 12 -- the only chance for real races in the many districts that are overwhelmingly Democratic. But there are so few real choices it feels like an Army mess hall. Take the 26 State Senate seats up for grabs this year in the five boroughs. There are only a few competitive contests, and there is a much longer list of sitting senators who deserve to be shaken out of their padded leather chairs.\n        A good example is State Senator Ada L. Smith, a Democrat in Queens. Ms. Smith, perhaps best known for her temper tantrums in Albany, ought to be the target for a good, ambitious challenger who believes voters deserve legislators who can behave in public. But her only serious opposition comes from City Councilman Allan Jennings, who has been fined $5,000 by the Council for sexual harassment.\n        In Brooklyn, State Senator Kevin S. Parker appeared to be one of the bright, new young Democrats when he arrived in Albany in 2003. But he's been a disappointment. Last year, he was charged with punching a traffic officer and forced to enroll in anger management counseling. Mr. Parker's only real opponent this year is Noach Dear, a perpetual candidate of shifting political stripes.\n        Too many other races fell victim to the state's warped political culture, under which candidates try to avoid the risk of an actual election by knocking their opponents off the ballot in court.\n        Of course, some incumbents are fine lawmakers who do a great job. But even they would benefit from the occasional reminder that they don't have lifetime tenure in Albany. So with one more cry of concern over the slim pickings, here are our endorsements in two Democratic primaries:\n        State Senate District 13 (northwest Queens: Jackson Heights, Corona, Elmhurst, Lefrak City and Woodside). Democratic voters in this area may not realize their luck, but they are blessed with a real choice between two very good candidates. John Sabini, the incumbent who took office four years ago, has been one of the brighter lights in the gloom of New York's state capitol, and he worked doggedly for reform in a State Senate that is just as doggedly stagnant and secretive. City Councilman Hiram Monserrate, the challenger, is a former policeman who has become an energetic force in the Hispanic community. And whatever happens in this race, Mr. Monserrate looks like a rising star in New York politics. Voters could not go wrong, whatever lever they pull. But given the importance of fighting for reform in Albany, our choice would be Mr. Sabini.\n        State Senate District 18 (northwest Brooklyn: Sunset Park, Red Hook, Downtown, Bedford Stuyvesant, Ocean Hill)State Senator Velmanette Montgomery is facing a challenge from former City Councilwoman Tracy L. Boyland, a member of the Boyland political family. Ms. Montgomery is a far better voice for her district, even though we don't agree with her that the Atlantic Yards project should be scrapped. The senator is perhaps best known in Albany for speaking out for the disenfranchised, most recently arguing against the use of shackles for female prisoners giving birth.

The other actually implemented it. The city that took action was London. The other -- the one with the vision thing -- was New York, which came upon the idea of congestion pricing a half century ago. The plan then went to that dark, lonely place where great ideas often go, never to be resurrected.\n        But now, a discussion of congestion pricing as part of the broader debate on how to limit traffic on New York's busiest streets can no longer be avoided. On any given day of the week, some 800,000 cars -- more than half of them personal vehicles -- pour onto the streets south of 60th St. in Manhattan. Forget a tipping point; New York's traffic has long passed that.\n        And every year, the daily number of cars creeps upward by the thousands -- some 13,500 annually, according to a study conducted by Bruce Schaller, a Brooklyn-based consultant. Transportation Alternatives, the group that commissioned the study, is one of several organizations pointing out what should be obvious -- that the city is choking in traffic.\n        While Mayor Michael Bloomberg has taken some steps to address traffic flow problems -- including restricting turns on designated Manhattan ''thru streets,'' and moving to encourage walking and cycling for commuters -- the larger issue of actually containing or reducing traffic seems to be on the back burner. It could be that the mayor too clearly remembers the hostile reception that forced him to abandon the idea of adding bridge tolls in his first term. Even so, ducking the traffic problem seems at odds with the sensibilities of a mayor who has otherwise given high priority to productivity, health and other quality of life issues -- all of which are negatively affected by the traffic logjam.\n        The mayor could start by taking a harder look at the success of London's congestion pricing program. The city charges daytime drivers in the central business district a fee of $14 a trip, allowing a 90 percent discount for residents who take the car for a spin in the area.\n        The result has been a drop of nearly one-third in vehicle traffic. But commuters have not been seriously discomfited; in almost all cases, workers who once relied on cars have been using public transit, which in turn has been upgraded with funds from the congestion surcharge.\n        Critics who fear congestion pricing argue that crowded streets reflect a vital economy. But in New York, traffic congestion has always been too much of a good thing. William Vickrey, a Columbia professor who came up with the notion of congestion pricing in the 1950's, could not have imagined the clogged streets we have today.\n        Gridlock can be measured in appointments missed, tardiness, environmental damage and even elevated blood pressure. Taking a third of the vehicles off New York's most heavily used streets can't hurt.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1695022,"ids":1695022,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"This morning Israel finally began withdrawing from the teeming, thirsty strip of land where it settled nearly 9,000 Jews in the middle of more than a million Arabs. Gaza has always been the ultimate example of the bankruptcy of Israel's settlement policy, and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon should be congratulated for finally doing what he and his predecessors should have done years ago. Now we must hope fervently that the withdrawal proceeds peacefully, without unnecessary provocation from troublemakers among militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\n        While the withdrawal from Gaza has long been demanded by Palestinians, it is in Israel's interest as well. It will free up Israeli soldiers who have been devoted to the defense of far-flung clusters of Jewish housing surrounded by hostile Palestinians. It is a rational response to the demographic challenges that threaten to leave Jews a minority unless Israel loosens its hold on the West Bank.\n        Unfortunately, Mr. Sharon seems to think that withdrawing from Gaza will buy Israel time to spend to consolidate in the West Bank. Even the pro-withdrawal officials in Mr. Sharon's hard-line Likud Party maintain that Gaza is not the beginning, but rather the end. Mr. Sharon's own chief political strategist has said that a central purpose of the Gaza withdrawal plan was to take Palestinian statehood off the table indefinitely. The belief appears to be that by ''giving'' President Bush Gaza, Israel will have bought for itself at least a lack of American pressure so that it can remain in the West Bank.\n        The Bush administration cannot buy into that line of thinking.\n        The so-called road map for peace calls for Israel to work with elected Palestinian officials to create a plan for a negotiated Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza. The responsibility of the Palestinians is to clamp down on terrorist activity against Israelis. Clearly, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, must demonstrate he can stop extremists from Hamas who labor under the mistaken belief that they will one day destroy the Israeli state.\n        But Mr. Bush must make clear to Mr. Sharon that the Gaza withdrawal is a first step. He must not allow Mr. Sharon to maneuver him into blessing an indefinite Israeli occupation of the West Bank.\n        Mr. Sharon, the architect of Israel's settlement policy, might have imagined a different legacy, but he will go down in history as the man who rammed the plan to dismantle the Gaza settlements through Parliament, taking on, and defeating, extreme right-wing members of his own Likud Party. Mr. Sharon should be cheered for taking this step. But he must also be forewarned: if there is to be any chance for peace, there are many more steps that must be taken.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1651358,"ids":1651358,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"This page does not have particularly strong feelings about the fate of the actor Roy Scheider's house in the Hamptons.\n        It is unfortunate, of course, that storm winds and waves have chewed away the dune protecting his Sagaponack property from the ocean, and that the stairs over the sand now dangle in air like a mangled fire escape. It is especially bad that the United States government had a hand in the problem, by having its Corps of Engineers build sea walls east of Sagaponack that starved westward beaches of replenishing sand, setting the stage years ago for the problems now giving Mr. Scheider and his neighbors such fits.\n        But our much bigger concern is about what the Sagaponack sand emergency -- and another one on Tiana Beach in Hampton Bays -- says about how far Long Island still needs to go to devise a comprehensive, sensible and environmentally sensitive approach to managing its southern shoreline.\n        In its never-ending struggle with the Atlantic Ocean, Long Island is hopelessly outmatched. It needs a battle plan, a strategy to balance the fundamental imperative of environmental protection with the competing needs of property owners and the tourism and fishing industries. Instead, it has always taken the localized, ad hoc approach. As predictably as the seasons, storms and erosion cause beaches to crumble, and towns, villages and homeowner groups seek ways to keep nature subdued. The cursed but often-essential jetties stay put, but the dredges keep dredging, the sand trucks keep dumping, the oceanfront homes keep going up -- and all the while the sands keep shifting.\n        As Paul Rabinovitch of the Nature Conservancy explains, Long Island from Fire Island to Montauk Point is caught between two possible futures. The first is an attempt at total control -- the Jersey Shore approach, with jetties, groins and regular beach replenishment. This works, but it's expensive and it essentially makes nature the responsibility of the public works department. The alternative is a hands-off philosophy that recognizes that beaches are like living things, growing and shrinking, with inlets that open and close to a rhythm that does not recognize home ownership or shipping channels.\n        Right now, Long Island is stuck between both points of view -- the stupidest place to be.\n        For a while it looked as if Long Island might get a plan for a sensible future, thanks to a long-awaited Corps of Engineers study of 83 miles of Suffolk's southern shoreline, including not just the Hamptons and Fire Island but also the shores of the Great South Bay, Moriches Bay and Shinnecock Bay. But the Bush administration has just cut the $1.7 million funding for the study from the federal budget. Given that about $30 million has already been spent on the study over more than 20 years, the move is inherently foolish and shockingly wasteful.\n        The value of the shoreline study was one of the few things on which property owners and environmental groups could agree. It wouldn't solve every problem; engineering studies don't generally provide enlightenment in local land use policy. But they are a good source of facts -- a vital foundation for weighing of competing interests.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1652424,"ids":1652424,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"This page has long been very wary of any moves by the Israeli government to further consolidate land it seized after the 1967 war without negotiations with the Palestinians. So we were a little queasy about the way Prime Minister Ariel Sharon coupled his plans to withdraw Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip with further work on the barrier that Israel is constructing to block itself off from its Palestinian neighbors.\n        Some Sharon observers are already likening the Gaza pullout to a chessboard-worthy move. Seen in that light, Mr. Sharon is sacrificing Gaza in return for the world's acceptance of Israel's ''de facto annexation of 7 percent of West Bank territory,'' as a political columnist, Nahum Barnea, theorized in Yediot Aharonot, a Hebrew-language daily. ''Sharon has not become a dove,'' Mr. Barnea wrote. ''He has remained what he always was: a pragmatic hawk.''\n        But whatever bird Mr. Sharon has chosen to emulate, it would be churlish to greet his historic decision with anything other than enthusiasm. The prime minister has risked enormous political capital in boldly going where his predecessors feared to tread: agreeing to evacuate settlements without first wringing something out of the Palestinians.\n        Thanks to Mr. Sharon's efforts, optimism and hope is spreading throughout Israel, and that can only be a good thing. It gives a boost to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and it further isolates Mr. Sharon's right-wing Likud Party members, particularly the finance minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the minister for Jerusalem affairs, Natan Sharansky.\n        The barrier remains troublesome. Its route was revised following a court order last year, which rightly said it imposed too many hardships on Palestinian civilians, many of whom were blocked from getting to work or visiting relatives. The new path of the barrier, Israeli officials say, will reduce the amount of West Bank land on the Israeli side of the fence to 7 percent from 15 percent. That's certainly better than the original plan. But the new path should not be treated as a permanent boundary when the time comes for peace talks about a final settlement with the Palestinians. The land that Israel has enclosed should remain on the bargaining table. Barriers are easy to construct, and should be just as easy to tear down.\n        Mr. Sharon has shown enormous political courage: he is keeping his majority coalition together by the skin of his teeth, and that coalition may not last to see the successful end of the Gaza withdrawal. We hope that it does, and that Mr. Sharon coordinates this historic withdrawal with the Palestinian Authority in a way that leaves impoverished Gaza with enough resources to allow the Palestinians to show the world that they can govern themselves.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1696967,"ids":1696967,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"This page has never been shy about criticizing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. But this week the last Jewish settlers left Gaza, completing Israel's withdrawal from the desert it took control of 38 years ago. And yesterday, Israeli soldiers completed the evacuation of four much smaller settlements among the hundreds on the West Bank. This is the first time Israel has abandoned communities in lands the Palestinians claim for their future state, so it is incumbent upon us -- and all of Mr. Sharon's many critics -- to reflect on this extraordinary accomplishment.\n        The history of the Jewish people made the relative ease of the Gaza evacuation all the more remarkable. For Israeli forces to force Jewish settlers off land that many consider theirs by birthright was clearly gut-wrenching. The commander of the Gaza pullout praised his troops, with good reason. So did Mr. Sharon. ''No state in the world can be as proud of having mobilized such a force in such difficult conditions,'' Mr. Sharon said, adding that they had done their job ''in a way that demands respect.''\n        Mr. Sharon can take pride in his own actions. He was resolute in the face of condemnation from extreme right-wing members of his own Likud Party, which may well fracture from the strain of the Gaza pullout. As the father of the Israeli settlements and a member of the bloc that has always favored a greater Israel, Mr. Sharon has nevertheless demonstrated that he is able to carry out a territorial compromise, a necessity if there is ever going to be any chance for peace.\n        The Palestinians have done themselves a favor by behaving with restraint during this emotional time. Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, knows that for better or worse, the Gaza pullout now puts the burden on the Palestinians to show that they can govern themselves. It would behoove the Arab states to favorably acknowledge the Israeli withdrawal and provide more aid to Mr. Abbas. That would further strengthen his hand among moderate Palestinians, who must be made to see that their best chance for peace and a Palestinian state lies with Mr. Abbas, and not militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\n        On Monday, Mr. Abbas called Mr. Sharon to praise him for a ''brave and historic decision.'' He suggested that Israel and the Palestinian Authority renew negotiations, and he told Mr. Sharon that ''we are your partner for peace.''\n        That is a good start. But both men have big battles looming. Mr. Sharon will probably face another election soon, with Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister, as his likely challenger for control of Likud. Mr. Abbas's party, Fatah, will be battling Hamas in the coming municipal and legislative elections.\n        Real peace talks are unlikely before those elections are settled, but such talks are needed to build on the Gaza withdrawal, which we hope is a sign of readiness to negotiate rather than a final gesture. In a region where there have been too many dark days, this flicker of sunshine deserves to be nurtured.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1840775,"ids":1840775,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"This page normally has little patience for people who gripe about paying taxes. But most of the four million taxpayers who owed the alternative minimum tax this filing season have cause to complain.\n        The alternative tax is supposed to apply to multimillionaires whose high-end tax shelters would otherwise reduce their tax bills to a pittance. The aim is a good one. But in the last decade, lawmakers have willfully undermined the tax's intent, mainly with overly generous tax breaks for investment income that enable many of the richest Americans to escape the alternative tax.\n        As a result, only an estimated 3 percent of alternative-tax payers for 2006 are tax-sheltering multimillionaires. Most people who owe the tax make between $200,000 and $500,000; nearly a fourth make $75,000 to $200,000. In those groups, the most common breaks are write-offs for children and for state and local taxes -- hardly aggressive tax shelters. Yet, on average, the alternative tax has boosted those filers' 2006 tax bills by an estimated $4,200.\n        So, there are really two problems with the alternative tax: it fails to catch tax avoidance among the richest taxpayers while ensnaring people it was never intended for. In recent hearings, Congress has focused mainly on the wrongly afflicted taxpayers. But that is the easier part of the problem to solve. Simply making inflation adjustments to the levels at which the tax kicks in -- which hasn't been done since 1993 -- would shield most taxpayers. Letting the Bush tax cuts expire as scheduled would also help. Because of the way tax provisions interact, those cuts cause many filers' tax bills to drop initially only to shoot back up when the alternative tax is assessed.\n        Which brings us to the real hot-button issue. The alternative tax should be reformed so that it does what it is supposed to do: make wealthy taxpayers with excessive tax shelters pay up. The wealthier one is, the more of one's income is from capital gains on the sale of investments rather than wages and salaries. Capital gains come with a huge advantage: they're taxed at 15 percent versus a top rate of 35 percent for ordinary income. The lower rate for capital gains is one of the biggest breaks in the code. But under the law, capital gains are not classified as sheltered income subject to the alternative tax.\n        The result is that the richest taxpayers get a windfall while the burden shifts to others. That huge -- and hugely unfair -- tax shift will soon get worse. In 2007, the alternative tax will affect 23 million filers. By 2010, it will hit 32 million taxpayers, including nearly all upper-middle-class families with children. Shielding those taxpayers from the alternative tax would mean the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. But much of that would be recouped if tax breaks on capital gains were treated the same as other tax breaks under the alternative tax. Lawmakers have their work cut out for them.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":20,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1795609,"ids":1795609,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"This week, if things go as planned, Yonkers Raceway will be reborn as a casino called Empire City, with bright lights and plush carpet and the first of what are expected to eventually be 5,500 slot machines in the biggest Las Vegas-style gambling operation this side of Atlantic City or woodsy southeast Connecticut. The $240 million overhaul of a dingy old haven for trotting horses and stubbly gamblers is taking place in phases, with the opening of part of the operation to be followed by a grand unveiling later this year with lots of noise and hoopla.\n        The rot will set in far more quietly. By that we mean the silent depletion of bank accounts, the erosion of credit ratings, the soundless misery of a growing cohort of losers laid low by compulsion and greed, and the spreading of a social cancer from the Catskills to the edge of New York City.\n        It's hard to avoid sounding moralistic when weighing in against the supposedly innocent fun of state-sponsored casino gambling, where busloads of grandmas while away the afternoons for an unassailably good cause -- education -- and hordes of cocktail waitresses and busboys hustle and bustle, grateful for their jobs and tips. But it needs to be said: The economic arguments in favor of gambling are fundamentally dishonest, as phony as the relentless cheeriness of the casino floor.\n        New York State sold its soul to gambling long ago for the promise of a seemingly painless stream of cash, and with its racing casinos and wide array of Lotto, Quick Draw and other games, the state is hooked on wagering in a big way. It took some casuistry to make this happen. The state Constitution actually forbids slot machines, but that problem was dodged by labeling them ''video lottery terminals.''

Gambling is a vacuum attached to poor people's pocketbooks. According to a 1996 study by the New York Council on Problem Gambling, the state's percentage of lifetime or potential problem gamblers is among the highest in the country.

The usual free-trade foes have been joined by many usually pro-trade Democrats who just want to stick it to President Bush and are doing so in this case under the guise of protecting workers. The opposition also includes the sugar lobby, which apparently believes the huge, trade-distorting protections it already gets are not enough and wants to block more imports.\n        The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Thomas, plans to woo more anti-trade Republicans to Cafta by expediting a bill that would make it easier to retaliate against subsidized imports from China. What that has to do with Central American trade is anybody's guess.\n        If Republicans and Democrats really want to help American workers compete in a global economy, they should be looking elsewhere, to retraining. The textile industry has long been one of the most protected in America. Tariffs on clothing bring in close to half of all tariff revenues per year, while those imports account for only about 6 percent of total imports. Despite all that protection, textile jobs have steadily disappeared.\n        Instead of trying to turn back time, politicians in Washington should be following the very good example being set by Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia. Seeking to stem the job hemorrhage in rural southern Virginia as the region's textile plants were shuttered, Mr. Warner started creating one-stop worker-assistance storefronts in depressed rural towns in 2002. Beyond helping laid-off workers navigate the maze of federal trade adjustment assistance and unemployment checks, Mr. Warner backed a program to help workers without a high school diploma get a G.E.D. in 90 days or less.

Indeed, the area's love for Nascar has been harnessed: state-sponsored ads tout the G.E.D. program at Nascar races.\n        So far, about 20,000 workers have gone through some aspect of the program, at one of the 131 centers in the state, Mr. Warner's aides say.

International data showed that several more nations who have been big customers for American debt -- including China and India -- have diversified their portfolios away from the American greenback. To us, that sounds like a serious threat to the long-term soundness of the national currency. But the Bush administration hasn't come close to addressing any of the economic fundamentals that have helped spawn the dollar's decline (the budget deficit comes to mind). Instead, the White House has been busy lobbying for new tax cuts that will make the situation worse.\n        Meanwhile, in a world in which the United States desperately needs international cooperation on everything from curbing the trade in terrorist weaponry to presenting a united front to countries like Iran and Syria, President Bush is spending his political capital on getting John Bolton, a longtime critic of multilateralism, as representative to the United Nations.\n        We had hoped, when Mr. Bush was re-elected, that he'd rethink his goals once the next campaign was no longer an issue. There are so many critical problems facing the nation. But the president seems determined to ignore the biggest challenges and to home in on politically charged side issues. Medicare faces a perilous future, given growing health costs and the aging of the baby boomer population, and anything approaching a resolution would require hard bipartisan work. But the White House instead decided to make privatizing Social Security its chief priority. Social Security's long-term problems are relatively minor compared with Medicare's, and the fixes are pretty obvious.\n        The list goes on and on. When we look at problems that cry out for White House involvement, one that leaps out is our dependency on foreign oil. That not only leaves us hostage to some of the shakiest and most unappetizing oil-producing nations around the globe, but also threatens the entire economy over the long term, given that rising oil prices make the trade deficit even bigger and the dollar even weaker. Another huge economic threat, at least for some agricultural regions, is the growing international pressure to end our irrational subsidy program for crops like cotton. Both of these are tricky political issues that require steady and firm presidential intervention.\n        We haven't heard Mr. Bush make a big deal about either, except for his fixation with drilling in the Arctic wildlife preserve. Meanwhile in Congress, all the political capital is being directed toward putting an anti-environmental former lobbyist for mining interests on the federal bench, and passing a new law that will make it difficult for middle-class credit card users who suffer a life catastrophe -- like sudden illness or divorce -- to get back on their feet after they have to declare bankruptcy.\n        The priorities of this administration never cease to amaze.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1840376,"ids":1840376,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Thomas Suozzi, the Nassau Executive, has taken a step from Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City in pushing county government to be a lot more aggressive in promoting the health and well-being of its citizens. A few years ago, Mr. Bloomberg raised the city tax on cigarettes to $1.50 a pack. Mr. Suozzi wants to make it $2 a pack in Nassau, and is urging the New York State Legislature to give him permission.\n        He made the plea this month not just on Nassau's behalf, but on behalf of seven other counties surrounding New York City -- the thought being that what's good for the city is good for the region, and that suburban counties should not become tobacco havens for jittery New Yorkers crossing borders to stretch their nicotine dollars further.\n        Mr. Suozzi's idea hasn't exactly taken off. There doesn't even appear to be any bandwagon to jump on -- no other county's leaders have risen to second the Nassau motion. And the odds of the plan's succeeding in Albany are indeed long if Nassau cannot get one of its Republican state senators to sponsor a bill in the Republican-controlled Senate. One senator, Kemp Hannon of Garden City, chairman of the Senate Health Committee, immediately made it clear that he thinks it's a bad idea. He supports programs to help people quit smoking, and would raise the minimum age for buying tobacco to 21, but he doesn't want a new tax.\n        That's unfortunate. Mr. Suozzi and his allies, Assemblywoman Earlene Hooper of Hempstead and Judy Jacobs, presiding officer of the Nassau Legislature, are right on this one. Some critics have made predictable arguments about Big Brother -- or Big Nanny, if you prefer -- picking taxpayers' pockets for a moral crusade. But government should be able to use its power to influence behavior in a way that promotes public health. It is true, and frustrating, that this power is wielded in a highly inconsistent way, that the same officials who want you to quit smoking also want you to throw your paycheck down the toilet of a state-sanctioned lottery, casino or racetrack. But sin taxes like the ones Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Suozzi support are generally good public policy.\n        The benefits Mr. Suozzi is seeking are not only medical. He figures that the tax could raise about $26 million to $31 million in revenue that Nassau badly needs. That is a decent argument, but far from the best one. Smoking is declining in New York City, for a lot of reasons that surely include the increasingly daunting cost of a pack of coffin nails. It is encouraging news for anyone who breathes, and officials from Nassau up to Rensselaer should join Mr. Suozzi in doing what they can to keep that good trend going.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":4,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1810445,"ids":1810445,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Three years after President Bush announced an ambitious long-term goal to return astronauts to the Moon and then send them on to Mars, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has finally put some flesh on his nebulous aspirations. This week, the agency announced plans to establish a permanent base on the Moon by 2024, explained why we should want to send astronauts back to a world they visited repeatedly more than three decades ago, and described what they might do when they get there. It was belated justification for a decision that the Bush administration and Congress have already made. But the payoff is distant and the likely future costs very high, leaving it unclear how realistic these aspirations will prove to be.\n        The agency has done a commendably thorough job by consulting some 1,000 experts and 13 other space agencies in fashioning its plans. Such a costly and difficult venture should ideally be pursued cooperatively with other nations, to share the costs and the risks. It would be especially desirable to have multiple ways of reaching the Moon in case the American program runs into problems like those that grounded the shuttles.\n        What's worrisome about the new plans is their lack of focus. The agency cites six major reasons for returning to the Moon. The most persuasive is to use the Moon as a base to test technologies and operating techniques to be used on future missions to Mars, a more compelling target. It makes sense to first try ''living off the land'' on the Moon, where astronauts are only days away from home should something go wrong, before taking the long leap to Mars. The venture is also justified on scientific, economic, educational and global partnership grounds, and as a step toward eventual settlements on the Moon.\n        The wide sweep of these rationales is reminiscent of the extravagant promises for the space station, which was sold to Congress as a steppingstone to the planets, a scientific and economic bonanza, and a stimulus for students but is still limping along, half finished and far over budget, with greatly diminished expectations for what it can accomplish.\n        An even more expansive document -- listing some 180 objectives that the astronauts might pursue on the Moon -- is essentially a wish list compiled after consulting virtually every expert in the world who might have an opinion. The list puts the lie to criticisms that there is almost nothing useful to do on the Moon. But some of the objectives have a pie-in-the-sky quality, like exporting power from the Moon for use on Earth, while others, like observatories on the Moon, might not prove feasible or affordable for decades. The objectives will need to be winnowed and focused if they are to serve as useful guides in pursuing the program.\n        If this nation is to continue a human space flight program it makes sense to pick a more exciting destination than a space station circling endlessly in low Earth orbit. Our main concern is that the political proponents of the Moon-Mars adventure will not provide money commensurate with the task. NASA's crowning scientific achievements have come from its unmanned probes to distant worlds and its orbiting observatories. It would be a shame if an underfinanced program to return to the Moon on a permanent basis and then venture on to Mars forced reductions in research programs of higher scientific value.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1645497,"ids":1645497,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Three years ago, President Bush created the Millennium Challenge Account to give more money to poor countries that are committed to policies promoting development. Mr. Bush said his government would donate billions in incremental stages until the program got to a high of $5 billion a year starting in 2006. While $5 billion is just 0.04 percent of America's national income, President Bush touted the proposal as proof that he cares about poverty in Africa and elsewhere. ''I carry this commitment in my soul,'' the president said.\n        For the third straight year, Mr. Bush has committed a lot less than he promised. Michael Phillips of The Wall Street Journal reports that the White House has quietly informed the managers of the Millennium Challenge Account to expect about $3 billion in the next budget. This follows a sad pattern. Mr. Bush said he would ask Congress for $1.7 billion in 2004; he asked for $1.3 billion and got $1 billion. He said he would ask for $3.3 billion in 2005; he asked for $2.5 billion and got $1.5 billion.\n        So if past is prologue, the Republican Congress will cut the diluted 2006 pledge even further.\n        None of that appears to bother the Bush administration, which continues to send high-ranking officials into the world to promote the anemic Millennium Challenge Account to poor nations. The program -- not the money, since the account has yet to pay out a single dollar -- is high on the list of talking points for cabinet officials like the United States trade representative, Robert Zoellick, who visited Africa in December and cited the program every chance he got. Speaking to Latin American ambassadors in Washington this month, a Treasury under secretary, John Taylor, hailed it as a ''major way in which we are working with countries to meet the challenge of increasing productivity growth.''\n        Officials at the Millennium Challenge Account are quick to list the countries that, through good governance, have qualified for the aid program. They are not as quick to list the countries that have received a dime: there aren't any. Still, Paul Applegarth, chief executive of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, assured us last week that President Bush's program is ''really moving at an extraordinarily quick pace.''\n        Maybe the administration should tell that to the 300 million Africans who lack safe drinking water, or the 3,000 African children under the age of 5 who die every day from malaria, or the 1 in 16 African women who die in childbirth, or the 6,000 Africans who die each day of AIDS. But wait. Maybe the president is planning to deal with the African AIDS catastrophe through his 2003 proposal to increase AIDS funds by $10 billion over the following five years?\n        Not unless he is planning to finish with a bang, because the White House is expected to ask Congress for only $1.6 billion more next year. When added to the amount that AIDS funds increased in 2004 and 2005, that would leave a whopping more than $6 billion to get out of Congress in the next two years to meet Mr. Bush's pledge. Congress and Mr. Bush will point to the ballooning deficit and say they don't have the money. But that was a matter of choice. They chose to spend billions on tax cuts for the wealthy and the war in Iraq. They can choose to spend it instead to keep America's promises.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":19,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1763302,"ids":1763302,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Tight budgets make for melancholy choices. In his effort to put New Jersey's fiscal house in order, Gov. Jon Corzine asked the State Supreme Court for permission to freeze aid to 31 school districts covered by the landmark Abbott v. Burke case.\n        Mr. Corzine argued that the state's perilous finances required drastic measures, and after hearing arguments from both the state attorney general, Zulima Farber, and advocates for the districts, the court agreed with the governor. Funding for the so-called Abbott schools, which serve about 250,000 students in the state's poorest cities and towns, will remain at about $4.25 billion in the fiscal year beginning July 1.\n        At a time when dozens of municipalities are cutting school budgets after voters rejected their spending plans last month, it seems only fair to ask the Abbott districts to tighten their belts, too. While these districts were underfinanced and underserved for years until the courts ordered additional state financing, it is also true that billions have poured into the Abbott program since the mid-1990's with only middling results so far.\n        Advocates argue that those billions are just beginning to make an impact, and they worry that a freeze might slow or even reverse that progress. But a budget freeze need not translate into cuts to vital classroom programs. With some creativity, Abbott districts can find a way to shield students from the effects of Mr. Corzine's freeze.\n        Freezing Abbott funds for a year can hardly be described as a good idea. But it does seem necessary, for two reasons. Not only must Trenton get out of the hole it has dug for itself, but it must also figure out how to obtain more accountability from the Abbott districts.\n        In her appearance before the State Supreme Court, Attorney General Farber admitted that Trenton had not properly supervised the billions it had spent on improving the education, and the lives, of students in Abbott districts. The Corzine administration has promised to put better controls and monitoring in place to make sure that the intended beneficiaries are, in fact, benefiting. However worthy the program, there is no excuse for inefficient spending and indifferent results.\n        In the same spirit, the governor might also wish to re-examine the Abbot status of some districts, like Hoboken, where gentrification has strengthened the local property tax base and thus their ability to pay more for local schools.\n        Mr. Corzine's decision to freeze Abbott funding no doubt was painful. But he must make good on his pledge to monitor Abbott spending, not because such controls will help balance the budget, but because they will help balance the scales of justice.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1661898,"ids":1661898,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Time will tell, to use an old editorial dodge, whether Josh Rattner is a prophet or just a noodge.\n        Mr. Rattner pulled a driver from a burning gasoline truck last year, risking his life and earning an invitation to a ''Heroes Breakfast'' at the Hilton Rye Town last week. But when it came time to smile and accept his plaque, he pulled a Marlon Brando and refused it, saying he could not allow himself to be a public relations tool of one of the day's corporate sponsors, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the Indian Point power plant. Mr. Rattner says Indian Point is a menace that should be shut down.\n        Mr. Rattner, an electrical contractor from Irvington, thus fired an early shot in what promises to be a long and ferocious struggle over the relicensing of Indian Point, the Hudson Valley's vital energy resource or nuclear nightmare -- take your pick -- in Buchanan, about 35 miles north of Times Square.\n        Already the environmentalists are out in force, firing away with news conferences and op-eds and calling in reinforcements from the hundreds of politicians and dozens of town and village boards that have called for the plant to be decommissioned. Besides traditional anxieties about meltdown, radioactive waste and the nuclear industry's wobbly economics, the enemies of Indian Point have a new trump card to play -- the fear of terrorism -- now that 9\/11 has jolted people into taking long-shot possibilities seriously.\n        Supporters of nuclear power have a trump card of their own: global warming, which looms as the environmental crisis of our age. This has prompted more than a few people in the green camp to argue that fossil fuel, not radiation, is the clear and present danger, and to embrace nuclear plants as a proven, readily available way to reduce carbon emissions and save the planet.\n        This page has been largely agnostic about nuclear power in general and Indian Point in particular, though it has expressed serious reservations about security at the plant, which is badly placed in a densely populated region, where a mass evacuation in an emergency would be extremely difficult. We have called for greater fortifications and a competent security force at Indian Point, but have seen no immediate reason to shut it down.\n        We hope the coming clashes will clarify what the region's residents think about whether to embrace or reject nuclear power along the Hudson. We hope further that this grappling will lay the groundwork for a much broader debate -- the kind of national discussion the Bush administration should be leading but is not, given that its energy policies amount to little more than an unwavering fixation on the maximal extraction and consumption of fossil fuels from anywhere and everywhere.\n        It may seem early in Westchester --Indian Point's reactor licenses are not up for renewal until 2013. But Indian Point is one of the biggest nuclear controversies around, aside from the long struggle over burying waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, and thus is a prime opportunity to sort out our energy priorities, reassess our seemingly boundless appetite for cheap power and weigh our tolerance for risk -- not just in the region, but across the nation.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1820877,"ids":1820877,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"To learn why a resurgent Taliban is fighting American and NATO troops to a military draw in Afghanistan, you have to go to the frontier region on both sides of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.\n        Our colleague, Carlotta Gall, did just that last month and what she learned led to a physical assault on her by Pakistani intelligence officials and five hours in custody for her photographer, Akhtar Soomro. The Pakistani agents broke into her hotel room and copied her notes and computer files. They then tracked down and questioned everyone she had interviewed in Quetta, a border city.\n        We now know why. Ms. Gall's reporting has determined that Quetta is an important rear base for the Taliban, and that Pakistani authorities are encouraging and perhaps sponsoring the cross-border insurgency. That is a role that Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, denies. But residents of the border area, opposition figures and Western diplomats point to specific cases of Pakistani involvement. Americans need to know more about this collusion and to demand better answers from General Musharraf.\n        There are many reasons that things are now going badly for the American-backed Afghan government. America shortchanged Afghanistan's security in its rush to invade Iraq. European allies have inexcusably failed to provide NATO with enough soldiers to carry out the expanded Afghan security mission it took on last year and have imposed hobbling restrictions on the activities of those they did send. The government of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, is rife with corruption, and the regional warlord allies it depends on to control outlying areas are even more thieving as well as shockingly brutal.\n        These problems all need to be addressed.

Democrats retorted that the Republicans were motivated by politics.\n        Of course they were. But in a state rocked by one scandal after another, who cares? The important thing is to enact meaningful reforms, regardless of who or what inspired them. The pressure of an upcoming election may be exactly what is needed to get legislators to vote for tough measures.\n        Among the proposals were a flat-out ban on pay-to-play -- the system in which people make campaign contributions in the hope of getting government contracts or jobs. The package would also ban dual office holding, require jail time for public officials convicted of wrongdoing and impose a tougher ethics code for public officials.\n        All these measures are needed as well as one other: a prohibition against ''wheeling'' -- a practice that allows a contributor in one town or county to evade rules against pay-to-play by channeling money to an organization or candidate in another part of the state.\n        Assembly Majority Leader Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat, described the Republicans' proposals as a ''warmed-over stew of existing legislative measures,'' and maybe they are. But that's only because the Democratic majority has failed to approve them. Just because a measure has been around a while does not mean it lacks merit.\n        And nobody can say these proposals are not timely. In recent weeks, a top Democrat and former state Senate president pleaded guilty to official misconduct. A leading Democratic state senator was charged with using his position to gain a $35,000 no-show job at the state's scandal-plagued medical and dental college. And Sen. Robert Menendez, involved in one of the nation's closest Senate races, has been accused of ethical improprieties.\n        Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine has made a commendable start at bringing about reform by signing an executive order requiring more than 50 independent authorities, including the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and the Casino Control Commission, to stop awarding big public contracts in secret. He also instituted tougher ethics standards for executive branch employees.\n        Now it's time for the governor to prod lackadaisical members of his own party to set aside partisanship and give the Republicans' ethics proposals the attention they deserve.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1768173,"ids":1768173,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Tom Suozzi, the Nassau County executive and rebel candidate for governor, is itching to rumble into office like a Hell's Angel. But he was looking more like a Hell's snowball last week, after a new poll showed his support pretty much where it has been since he entered the race against Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in February. Despite a boisterous, barnstorming campaign that has featured relentless attacks on his opponent and detailed prescriptions for reforming Albany, Mr. Suozzi remains stuck in fringe-candidate territory. The Newsday\/NY1 News poll showed that Mr. Spitzer would demolish him in a hypothetical Democratic primary, 65 percent to 10 percent.\n        Mr. Suozzi and his supporters say it's only a matter of time before his campaign takes off, but to take off you have to pick up speed, and Mr. Suozzi has spent months moseying down the runway in first gear. He has shown little ability to attract voters' attention or to scuff the sheen of invincibility that long ago formed around Mr. Spitzer, who has been picking up endorsements and campaign dollars like deer ticks.\n        The Democratic Party clearly wishes that Mr. Suozzi would give up sooner rather than later, and in running against a far more prominent Democrat, he may have bitten off much more than he can chew. But chew he should, as well as snap and snarl. It's good for voters to be able to choose among candidates with serious intentions and a credible message, and Mr. Suozzi has both in abundance.\n        Mr. Suozzi has organized his campaign around issues of acute importance to suburban voters, like property taxes, schools and job creation, and has pressed Mr. Spitzer for details on how he would pay for all the new spending he has promised on the stump. His pointed jabs, ineffective so far, are far better than the florid generalities of a coronation.\n        But how long can Mr. Suozzi flirt with disaster before he packs it in? Some residents of Nassau are resentful of Mr. Suozzi's ambition and the campaign that keeps him away from Mineola most days. Governmental brush fires have broken out back home. The county hospital is struggling. The County Legislature has done much in recent weeks to reinforce its reputation as a den of goofballs. It recently appointed to the county health-care agency a man of dubious qualifications who is best known for having faked his own kidnapping.\n        Mr. Suozzi himself has sometimes seemed distracted and out of touch lately, never more so than when he unwittingly set off a furor with an off-the-cuff remark about congestion pricing on the Long Island Expressway.\n        He has promised not to drop the ball on county business, and we expect him to keep that promise. Perhaps with less upstate barnstorming, Mr. Suozzi can still keep up the articulate and forceful arguments that are a balm for the thinking voter, while not neglecting Nassau.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1653228,"ids":1653228,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Tonight Americans will be tuning in, as we always do this time of year, for another episode of television's oldest reality program, the Academy Awards.

But the real fun is seeing the most famous people on the planet doing things that we ourselves have done, like walking, sitting and clapping. Year after year, the best part of the show is always the audience reaction shots -- Will Smith here, Angelina Jolie there, Jack Nicholson grinning front and center. This is the nearest many of us will ever get to seeing a movie star almost unaware of being observed.\n        When it comes to the size of its television audience, the Academy Awards is more or less holding its own, though its producers must be praying for another Bob Hope, an M.C. who can take the show steadily in hand and give it the raffish dignity that Mr. Hope once did. But other televised awards programs appear to be losing their audience shares. This year, the Grammys and Golden Globes fell well short of last year's ratings. One reason, of course, is a glut of awards shows. Celebrities seem to gather in front of television cameras to honor each other with plaques and statuettes nearly every night of the week. But it may be, too, that the awards shows are suffering from the success of reality TV. The makers of reality TV shows appear to have noticed that television audiences like to be embarrassed as much as they like to be entertained. We enjoy squirming in our seats. The fact is that nearly ordinary people, when faced with the cameras, do a better job of making us squirm than do movie stars, who get far too much practice climbing stairs in low-cut ball gowns and reading from a teleprompter with hair in their eyes. We are like auto racing fans. We like to say we watch for the sport of it, not for the crashes. But we enjoy the crashes nevertheless.\n        Sooner or later the producers of televised awards shows will catch on. Male nominees at the country music awards might be required to take off their cowboy hats at least once. The Grammys might go completely acoustic, like an episode of ''MTV Unplugged.'' The People's Choice Awards might ask Jason Alexander to be the show's host again. As for the Academy Awards, its formula is tried and true, the progenitor of all the others. We hardly expect anyone to provide a show like Marlon Brando, refusing the Oscar for a political point.

What began with the VCR has expanded to include the DVD player, the digital video recorder, on-demand television, Internet broadcasts and downloads for iPods. Viewers with eclectic tastes can track down obscure favorites on the Web. Instead of watching ''The Sopranos'' during the Sunday night broadcast, busy viewers can order it up later, at their leisure.\n        We all have the option now to live in the lonely isolation of our own exact tastes, on our own uncompromising schedules. Everybody's happy, right?\n        Wrong. When you say that you recorded that season premiere episode of ''The Sopranos,'' you're essentially declaring yourself to be an island.

Arnold Schwarzenegger of California. This week, the two agreed to collaborate on cleaner-burning technologies and to explore an emissions-reduction program that would combine mandatory controls on greenhouse gases with market incentives to reduce the costs of compliance.\n        Mr. Blair said he was not end-running his good friend President Bush. The governor was less diplomatic, saying that the administration and Congress had shown no leadership on the issue. In any case, the White House was a conspicuous no-show. No surprise there: the meeting of politicians and corporate executives, convened to discuss climate change, served only to dramatize how badly Washington lags both Britain and California with its program of voluntary reductions and Hail Mary technologies.\n        And California is about to get a lot tougher. Later this month, the Legislature will vote on two ground-breaking bills. One would set binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions with a goal of reducing them to 1990 levels by 2020 -- an ambitious undertaking by any measure.\n        The other is a strikingly original bill that would bar long-term contracts with any out-of-state utility that failed to meet strict standards for pollution. A coal-fired plant in Wyoming, for instance, could sell power into California only if it found ways to dispose of most of its carbon dioxide, instead of merely venting it into the atmosphere. A bill like this would not only help California meet its targets but could also help jump-start clean-coal technologies that will be essential to reducing carbon dioxide emissions in countries like China and India.\n        For good measure, the Legislature will entertain two more warming-related bills, and Californians will be asked to vote in November on a ballot initiative that would raise $4 billion to promote alternative fuels.\n        All of this is may be too ambitious even for environmentally conscious Californians. But a recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that two-thirds of the state's voters supported an aggressive attack on global warming. And while Mr. Schwarzenegger's re-election chances will clearly benefit from appealing to these voters, this is a genuinely bipartisan effort of the sort that has completely eluded Congress.\n        Moreover, California has long enjoyed taking the lead on environmental issues and bringing other states with it. Four years ago, Mr. Schwarzenegger signed the so-called Pavley bill aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from cars. Though the law has been challenged by the automobile companies and the Bush administration, 10 other states have adopted similar legislation.\n        Meanwhile, the alarms about the consequences of warming have grown louder. Californians are particularly worried about the snowpack that provides their drinking water, about coastal erosion and about the dangerous ground-level air pollution that comes with heat waves. But a strategy useful for California will become even more valuable if it serves as a template for the nation.\n        Editorial\n        Correction:  August 8, 2006, Tuesday  In Saturday's editorial on pollution laws in California: It was Gov.

In the name of reforming the nation's civil justice system, and with scant public debate, President Bush and Congressional Republicans are racing to reward wealthy business supporters by changing the rules for class-action lawsuits. Their real objective is to dilute the impact of strong state laws protecting consumers and the environment and to make it harder for Americans to win redress in court when they are harmed by bad corporate behavior.\n        The proposed legislation, the so-called Class Action Fairness Act, will be taken up by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, with a vote by the full chamber expected as early as next week. Under the bill's sweeping provisions, nearly all major class-action lawsuits would be moved from state courts to already stretched federal courts. New procedural hurdles and backlogs would be destined to delay or deny justice in many cases, and to discourage plaintiffs and plaintiffs' lawyers from pursuing legitimate claims in the first place.\n        The proposed lunge to federal courts is so extreme that cases would be removed to federal courts even when a vast majority of the plaintiffs were from one state, the claimed injuries occurred in the state and involved possible violations of state law, and the principal defendant had a headquarters elsewhere but did substantial business in the state.\n        In a revealing but disappointing move last year, the measure's proponents rejected a balanced compromise that would have broadened federal jurisdiction while preserving the role of state courts in cases that are more local than national in flavor. Despite some useful provisions aimed at genuine abuses, the bill would reduce the accountability of corporations that violate laws protecting employees, consumers and the environment.\n        The measure died in the Senate at the close of the last session. But with President Bush now actively campaigning for its passage, the juggernaut may be unstoppable, particularly since some key Democrats, like Senators Charles Schumer of New York and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, switched sides last year to back the bill in exchange for some modest revisions. The new Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Arlen Specter, should at least be willing to entertain a handful of improving amendments. The most crucial would fix the bill's Catch-22: plaintiffs filing class-action suits could be refused a hearing in state court if they came from several different states, and then bounced out of federal court because their complaint called for applying the laws of multiple states.\n        The ability of ordinary citizens with similar injuries to band together to take on powerful corporate interests by utilizing the mechanism of class-action lawsuits is one of the shining aspects of the nation's civil justice system. That reality tends to be overlooked amid all the overwrought spinning by the president and others who are trying to drum up concern about a litigation ''crisis'' and to pressure Congress to usurp proper state authority and weaken important protections for ordinary Americans.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1640574,"ids":1640574,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Tourists at Sing Sing -- now there's an idea. The county executive, Andrew J. Spano, floated it this week in a letter to the Empire State Development Corporation. He wants to create a museum at the maximum-security state prison in Ossining, so visitors can take a ferry up the river to the Big House, see the old electric chair where Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Albert Fish, the serial killer-cannibal, met their fates, and wallow in the 1920's romance of the place. Like Alcatraz in San Francisco, Sing Sing in Westchester could be a cash machine, pulling in, by Mr. Spano's estimate, $20.5 million a year.\n        It's a wonder no one thought of it before.\n        Well, some people have. Visiting Sing Sing is a tradition that dates to the late 1800's, when tourists lined up to stare through peepholes in the prison walls. In the 1920's, the prison drew more than 3,000 people a day. Local officials and residents of Ossining drew up plans for a museum a few years ago, but the project has not raised enough money to fly.\n        No offense to the citizens of Ossining, but this has all the markings of a truly bad idea.\n        Why so, when historic prisons are such a draw in San Francisco, Dublin and London? Could it be because Sing Sing, unlike those other places, is still a prison? Because more than 1,700 inmates and about 650 guards are there on any given day? Because the place tourists would want to see -- the historic cellblock built by inmates in 1825 -- is within the prison walls, posing an interesting security challenge? And, finally, because there is something repellent and cruel about cashing in on the lurid impulses of throngs of people with Slurpees and fanny packs, no matter what precautions are taken to keep them from gawking at real live inmates? The Spano news release makes much of the fact that tourists flocked to Sing Sing in the 1920's. They did, but back then they also formed big crowds at community lynchings and freak shows.\n        Still, as Mr. Spano points out, there is big money to be made. Maybe these are manageable objections. Maybe visitors could resolve the queasy moral issues by filling out a release form:\n        ''I, the undersigned, am aware that I am visiting a working, maximum-security, men-only state prison, home to murderers, child molesters, forgers, bank robbers, most of them violent, some mentally ill, many the products of a dehumanizing criminal-justice system marred by inadequate drug treatment and psychiatric care. Men are raped and beaten here, but I'll try not to think about it.''\n        The Ossining town supervisor, John Chervokas, has been thinking about a Sing Sing museum for years, and says he is well aware of the problem of sensationalism. He envisions a modest, respectful place that instructs visitors about the long and flawed history of American penology, and does little to satisfy lurid tastes. He says that nobody in Mr. Spano's administration contacted him about last week's news release. For the sake of keeping this plan within the boundaries of the humane and sensible, someone should.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1821982,"ids":1821982,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Turning Stewart International Airport in New Windsor into the New York metropolitan area's fourth major air hub is a bold proposition that sets the mind racing at the grand possibilities, though it can also prompt a sinking feeling when one remembers the many ways that big ideas can fall flat.\n        For now, though, things look far more promising than ominous. Gov. Eliot Spitzer was elected on a platform of change and with ambitious promises to bring jobs and growth upstate. A plan that would ease chronic delays and congestion at Newark, LaGuardia and Kennedy airports while stimulating economic growth in the Hudson Valley is a natural fit for the Spitzer agenda.\n        The idea of expanding Stewart Airport has been talked about for years, but went nowhere in the Pataki administration. New Yorkers are lucky that the opportunity lingered long enough to be seized last week by the Port Authority, which plans to acquire the airport lease from the British company that put it up for sale last year.\n        Stewart International is a fancy name for what is now a sleepy hub 60 miles north of New York City. But the site, a former Air Force base, is bigger than Newark International. It is near two interstate highways, the New York State Thruway and I-84, and the Metro-North railroad. While Stewart handles only a few hundred thousand passengers a year, the Port Authority expects that it could serve more than three million a year in about five years. Most of these would be travelers living north and west of New York City, which would mean huge relief for the people and planes now using the three big-city airports, which have reached the bursting point and cannot expand any more.\n        Stewart's vast promise carries many perils. In nearby Newburgh, the economic activity spurred by the airport can be seen in a profusion of big-box stores and strip malls. Growth is clearly better than stagnation, but the Hudson Valley region needs to manage its growth wisely, with particular attention to how an expanded airport might strain the transportation grid and encourage the deadly spread of sprawl.\n        Governor Spitzer wisely couples the words ''smart growth'' with his calls for spurring economic development. These principles -- which envision sensible, human-scale development not fatally wedded to the automobile -- must apply to the changes envisioned in New Windsor.\n        As Ned Sullivan of the environmental group Scenic Hudson has warned in these pages, the unmatched beauty and peacefulness of the Hudson River valley are more than a precious aesthetic resource. They are the region's economic mainstay. As long as it is done carefully, Stewart International Airport should be able to expand to its potential as a vital regional transportation hub, linked to the metropolitan grid by improved rail service and existing in harmony with its neighbors.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1822602,"ids":1822602,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Twenty years ago, the Florida Legislature cravenly decided to allow ''law abiding'' citizens to carry concealed weapons merely by declaring their preference for self-defense. Then last July, at the prodding of the gun lobby, the current crop of state lawmakers proved they could be even more corrupt and cowardly than their predecessors by deciding to make the list of gun-toting Floridians a secret.\n        Fortunately, a local newspaper has given residents of the state a look at their representatives' gruesome handiwork.\n        When the law was first enacted, there were fewer than 25,000 licensed gun holders. Since then, the state roll has boomed to 410,000 and counting. As the veil descends on this dangerously macho part of the public record, enterprising articles in The South Florida Sun-Sentinel are laying bare the fact that more than 1,400 people easily got gun licenses despite pleading guilty or no contest to felonies that included manslaughter, burglary and child molestation. In Broward County alone, gun licenses grew in 20 years to more than 35,000 from 25.\n        Sampling records just before the law took effect, the newspaper uncovered hundreds of tales of mayhem, official indifference and glaring loopholes in criminal justice protection. One man got a license after pleading no contest to manslaughter in fatally shooting his girlfriend in the head while she cooked him breakfast. Another applicant was licensed despite guilty pleas to an assault charge, for holding a handgun against his roommate's head in an argument, and to a later grand theft charge.\n        Those permitted to pack concealed weapons include 216 people with outstanding criminal warrants, 128 under domestic violence injunctions and 6 registered sex offenders.\n        The gun lobby, predictably enough, is blaming ''bleeding-heart, criminal-coddling judges and prosecutors'' for this grim state of affairs. The truth is that the National Rifle Association has succeeded too well in herding legislators to do its dangerous bidding. Lawmakers in 38 states have approved bills allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons.\n        As in some of those states, Florida's legislators take the position that it's no fun to have a gun if you can't use it. So they loosened the laws on self-defense to allow a civilian to stand and use deadly force ''if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary.''

At the Group of 8 summit meeting in Scotland in July, Mr. Bush pledged to double aid to Africa by 2010, compared with the level in 2004. And at a United Nations summit meeting in New York in September, he said, ''I call on the world's nations to implement the Monterrey Consensus,'' which calls for rich countries to increase their spending on development aid to 0.7 percent of gross national product by 2015.\n        Toward that end, Mr. Bush requested a $2.3 billion increase from Congress for poverty-related development assistance in next year's budget. But this week, House and Senate negotiators broke the promise. They agreed to a foreign aid budget that would cut nearly $2 billion from Mr. Bush's request. The president's much-hyped Millennium Challenge Corporation, which is supposed to provide money to poor countries that practice good governance, would be held to $1.77 billion, about $1.2 billion below the White House's request.\n        Lawmakers were more generous on another front, approving an estimated $2.82 billion to fight AIDS globally. But the battle against endemic poverty in Africa, Asia and Latin America is one that America, as the richest country on earth, must lead. Cutting funds from the amount requested by the White House is hardly the way to equip troops for that fight.\n        Britain, France and Germany have all announced how they plan to reach that 0.7 percent goal for development assistance by 2015. The United States, which was rated the world's second-stingiest country (behind Italy) by a recent United Nations report, gives just 0.18 percent of its G.N.P. to poorer countries.\n        President Bush has done a better job than his predecessor, Bill Clinton, at ramping up assistance to Africa. But he hasn't come close to doing enough. His Millennium Challenge project has been slow off the mark, to say the least, signing contracts with only a handful of countries. Budget cutters in Congress say that until the program starts actually giving money to poor people, they're hard pressed to give it money. That's something of a dodge because those same lawmakers have shortchanged the program from the start. But the officers and board members of the Millennium Challenge Corporation -- including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- must do more to breathe some life into the program.\n        For the president, this is the time to show that his fine words about tackling global poverty are more than just words. His party is in charge -- both at the White House and on Capitol Hill -- and he has been willing to use the threat of a veto to try to stop a law banning torture at American military prisons.

One of those groups, the one dominated not by scientists but by election officials, was more grudging than it should have been. But their analyses should give further support to members of Congress who plan to push next month for a strong federal law requiring voter-verified paper records.\n        More than half of the states now have laws requiring electronic voting machines to produce paper records that voters can review to ensure that their votes were correctly recorded. Voters understand that without this paper, there is no way of knowing if the software registered their choices incorrectly, either by accident or by design.\n        The National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency that promotes good standards in everything from medical devices to smoke detectors, recently concluded that paperless electronic voting is unacceptable. The agency's scientists said that for electronic voting to be trustworthy, it must be ''software independent,'' meaning there has to be a means apart from the machines' own software to prove that the vote tallies are correct.\n        The obvious way to do this is a voter-verified paper record. The institute allowed that there could be other ways, like a video or audio record of votes cast, but those technologies remain unproven.\n        NIST's report went to the technical guidelines committee of the Election Assistance Commission, the federal agency created after the 2000 meltdown to help improve elections. The guidelines committee voted down a resolution recommending that electronic voting be used only if the results are independently verifiable. Instead, it affirmed the need for paper trails or other independent verification going forward, but recommended giving a pass to localities already using flawed machines.\n        It is unfortunate that the stronger resolution did not pass. There is no excuse for sticking with unreliable voting machines. The guidelines committee has too many election officials on it, a group who often put their own convenience -- and their desire not to be embarrassed by paper vote totals that conflict with the machine totals -- ahead of the voters' interest in unimpeachable election results. Still, its opposition to paperless electronic voting is significant.\n        The Election Assistance Commission, whose role is merely advisory, long ago missed the chance to take the lead on electronic voting reform. The states that adopted paper requirements have done that. And it now looks as if Congress may finally resolve the matter for the whole nation.\n        Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Representative Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, plan to introduce legislation to require voter-verified paper records. That legislation has a good chance of passing.

In three bills approved by both houses and signed by President Bush, the 109th Congress has awarded wilderness designation to 11,000 acres of canyonland and desert in New Mexico, 10,000 acres of rain forest in Puerto Rico and 100,000 acres in the Cedar Mountains of Utah.\n        Four more wilderness bills have cleared one house or the other, and when approved will add an additional 750,000 acres of wilderness in California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. More such bills are waiting in the Congressional wings.\n        The Wilderness Act of 1964 prohibits all commercial activity -- roads, buildings, logging, drilling -- in areas designated as wilderness, the highest level of protection given to any public lands, including the national parks. Congress has designated roughly 106 million acres as permanent wilderness, more than half of it in Alaska.\n        Measured against this number, the latest designations may seem like small change. Yet they reflect rare moments of bipartisan cooperation at a time when Congress seems polarized on just about everything, not least conservation issues. They also reflect well on local groups that have worked long and hard to find common ground between environmentalists and commercial interests. And while Mr. Bush seems as determined as ever to open up chunks of the public estate to commerce, especially for oil and gas drilling, like other presidents before him he finds it impossible to resist grass-roots ideas that have been so thoroughly debated in advance.\n        This is not to say that all wilderness bills are free of low motives and commercial intent. One particularly distasteful example is a bill introduced by Senator Robert Bennett and Representative Jim Matheson of Utah. It would sell off 40 square miles of federal land to private developers in Washington County, the fifth-fastest-growing county in the country and already something of a monument to suburban sprawl and strip development. In exchange, it offers wilderness protection to about 220,000 acres.\n        Wilderness bills often involve land swaps -- small amounts of land for commercial purposes in exchange for lots more permanent wilderness -- and the Utah deal would seem to fit the pattern. It doesn't. First, about half the proposed wilderness is already protected. Second, some of the proceeds would go not for local conservation projects but for off-road vehicle trails and, most alarming, for a 120-mile pipeline to draw water from Lake Powell, which is already stressed by undisciplined development. Third, there has been little public input. Finally, there appears to be plenty of private land available to satisfy Washington County's insatiable needs.\n        This is, in short, a raid on national resources aimed at helping private developers. It is the worst sort of Congressional earmarking. And it gives true wilderness bills a reputation they do not deserve.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1741151,"ids":1741151,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Unless new policies are enacted soon, many Americans are destined for a deprived old age. Some 70 million people, nearly half of the work force, have no employer-provided savings plan of any kind. Over all, half of American households have saved little or nothing for retirement.\n        The response from the Bush administration has been off the mark, at best. For the fourth time in a row, President Bush's annual budget calls for the creation of two new kinds of tax-sheltered accounts that would mostly benefit people who already save megabucks every year. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush's perennial savings proposal for low- and moderate-income earners is routinely ignored on Capitol Hill. But even if it were taken seriously, it's too limited to reach most of the people who need to save more.\n        There is a better way. In fact, the groundwork has already been done. Last week, researchers from the conservative Heritage Foundation and the liberal Brookings Institution released a joint proposal to make saving for retirement universal (available at www.retirementsecurityproject.org). The centerpiece of the plan is the automatic individual retirement account, or auto-I.R.A. Employees who are not covered by an employer's savings plan would be allowed to divert a portion of each paycheck into this vehicle. All but the smallest employers would be required to offer direct deposit for their workers' contributions, and all employers -- large or small -- would get tax breaks for doing so.\n        Groundbreaking research on savers' behavior is built into the auto-I.R.A. design. Studies have shown, for instance, that automatically enrolling employees in a plan -- unless they opt out -- dramatically increases participation. And if people are asked whether they want to save, most say ''yes.'' Auto-I.R.A.'s would be set up using one of these two effective approaches, depending on what is most convenient for the employers, instead of leaving it up to workers to take the initiative of enrolling.\n        Government could play a vital role by matching employees' auto-I.R.A savings -- say, dollar for dollar on the first $500 that a worker contributes. Offering a match is a proven way to increase both participation and the amount that employees are willing to save. In contrast, offering tax deductions for savings -- the government's preferred incentive -- has been of little or no value to low- and middle-income savers. Lawmakers could offer an auto-I.R.A. match for far less than what it would cost to extend the Bush tax cuts.\n        In a recent poll of registered voters, 83 percent favored auto-I.R.A.'s. Americans are waiting for leaders who will take them where they want to go.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1786908,"ids":1786908,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Unless something changes soon, by the end of President Bush's second term North Korea will have produced enough plutonium for 10 or more nuclear weapons while Iran's scientists will be close to mastering the skills needed to build their own.\n        That's quite a legacy for a president sworn to keep the world's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the world's most dangerous regimes.\n        Even if the United States were not tied down in Iraq, military action would be a disaster. Besides, American analysts don't know where North Korea has stashed its plutonium nor what technology Iran might have hidden. Its huge centrifuge plant at Natanz is still nearly empty, and the more threatened Iran feels, the more reason it has to hide its program.\n        If Mr. Bush has any hope of avoiding this legacy, he will have to give up his dreams of regime change, persuade his battling inner circle that he means it and direct Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to do some real diplomatic horse trading -- starting with a clear pledge that the United States will not try to overthrow either government as long as each abandons its nuclear ambitions.\n        Only in Mr. Bush's go-it-alone world would Ms. Rice get so much outside credit -- and so much inside criticism -- for her clenched-teeth approach to these negotiations. It's also not working.\n        Iran defied the Security Council's demand that it stop enriching uranium. The good news is that it is making only slow progress. It is also restricting inspectors' access and refusing to answer questions.\n        The Bush administration was right to bring Iran before the Security Council. It will have to work even harder to convince Russia and China to impose some punishment. The threat of isolation might have some effect on Iranian politics. But unless the council agrees to cut off Iran's oil exports -- not even a tough-talking White House seems ready to pay the political price for even higher gas prices -- its leaders are unlikely to be quickly swayed.\n        It has been months since North Korea and the other members of the six-party talks even sat at the table. When Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill proposed going to North Korea to try to jump-start the process, he was told no by his bosses.\n        The only approach with even the remotest chance of success is to persuade these regimes that they do not need nuclear weapons to ensure their survival, and that there will be real rewards for good behavior.\n        This doesn't mean ignoring all their other misdeeds. If anything, it should allow the United States to open a wider discussion with them about their mistreatment of their citizens or sponsorship of terrorism or sales of illicit technology.\n        There is no guarantee that Tehran or Pyongyang will accept such an offer. A serious try by Washington would certainly make it harder for Russia and China and skittish Europeans to oppose sanctions. In Iran's case, it might also start the internal political debate that Mr. Bush has been hoping for -- and that his paeans to democracy and saber rattling have failed to produce.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1688939,"ids":1688939,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Until the attacks in London two weeks ago, efforts to secure the trains and buses that carry some seven million riders through the New York City area every day have moved with too-deliberate speed. The state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority, with some $600 million in state and federal funds to spend on system security, has managed to spend only a small fraction of that amount. The authority now says it is ready to spend more than half of the money by the end of the year, and spend it efficiently. That's welcome but overdue news. That nothing horrible has happened in the city's public transit system is no reason to put off what can be done now to reduce the risk of attack.\n        Behind the delay were bureaucratic issues and miscalculations, including the dismissal of the authority's two top security officials and a failed effort to employ the United States Army to design a security plan. A larger long-range hurdle is the difficulty of making security systems work in the fast-moving world of mass transit. The federal government should be spending far more money and energy developing new technology, and adapting walk-though detectors that check for explosives' residue to make them practical for subways. The same goes for smart cameras that detect unusual movements in crowds, or even unattended parcels.\n        For right now, though, the M.T.A. is sensibly going low-tech. It is using more of its funds to add to the ranks of its own small police force and to train and use bomb-sniffing dogs. And, even better, it is moving to help finance the nearly $2 million in weekly overtime pay going to city police officers.\n        Since the July 7 attacks, New York has put officers on every subway platform and on every train. But more is needed. The department had nearly 41,000 officers in 2000, and now has just over 37,000, with only 1,000 dedicated to counterterrorism work. That's too few. The attacks of Sept. 11, and on public transportation in Madrid, Moscow and London, mean that more police officers will be needed here for the long term.\n        Officers cannot be everywhere, of course, so there should be an immediate increase in the number of surveillance cameras for public transit. There are nearly 3,000 such devices in the subway system, but there should be many more.\n        Cellphones should also be able to function wherever possible. The likelihood of such phones being used to trigger explosive devices is outweighed by the assistance they could provide to the innocent in an emergency. It would probably be too costly to wire the entire subway system for cellphone reception, but it would be a good start to begin wiring the stations.\n        It's telling that the number of calls to the police to report suspicious packages on the city's subways and buses tripled after the London attacks. The M.T.A.'s campaign for vigilance -- ''If you see something, say something'' -- has indeed raised commuters' awareness. Now the authority needs to work harder to lower commuters' anxiety.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1840396,"ids":1840396,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Until the speaker of the House, James Amann, decided to limit his fund-raising work last month, he was involved in a clear conflict of interest for which he was justifiably criticized. On the side, Mr. Amann has been raising money for the Multiple Sclerosis Society's Connecticut chapter, for which he is paid $67,500. In that job he solicited donations from the same lobbyists who would do just about anything to curry his favor as the most powerful man in the legislature.\n        How could that not be a conflict?\n        To his credit, Mr. Amann voluntarily curtailed his activities and asked the Office of State Ethics for an opinion. He had done this once before; the State Ethics Commission said two years ago that as long as the donations enriched only Mr. Amann's employer, not him personally, his activities were just fine -- thus demonstrating to all why the commission deserved to be disbanded, which it was, and replaced with a tougher state agency.\n        Last month, the ethics office issued the right decision, though it was only a draft. Mr. Amann, it said, should not solicit money from lobbyists and, just as important, from the companies and clients the lobbyists represent.\n        Mr. Amann complains that this opinion raises the question of whether anyone could work at any job and still be a member of the General Assembly. The decision does not do that. But his situation illuminates a larger issue: many legislators have jobs, and as a result the legislature is rife with conflicts of interest.\n        For example, for years Connecticut's drunken driving laws were riddled with loopholes in part because defense lawyers in the legislature fought to make them that way. Their legal practices included -- you guessed it -- defending drunken drivers. The Joint Committee on the Judiciary is loaded with lawyers who routinely vote to confirm judges before whom they often later try cases, another potential conflict. The Joint Committee on Insurance and Real Estate includes members who hold jobs in those fields, and whose votes could have a significant impact on those professions. And so on.\n        It is understandable that legislators gravitate toward committees that deal with issues they know something about and care about. Even so, these predictable and quite ordinary associations present at the very least the appearance of conflicts of interest, and thus generate public cynicism and undermine faith in government.\n        Making things worse, legislators exempted themselves from a state law forbidding state officials or employees from using their jobs in a way that would financially benefit themselves or their families. A proposed bill would make the law apply to elected officials, as it always should have.\n        If the bill passes, it is only fair that state legislators get a raise. Their salaries, at $28,000 a year, are not exorbitant, and they have not had an increase since 2001. We do not need a full-time legislature. But we do need legislators who minimize conflicts of interest, and paying them a higher salary will help them do so.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1651356,"ids":"1651356,1651394,1651478","split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Until this year, most committee meetings for the New York State Legislature were gaveled open and closed in the blink of a chairman's eye. The sessions were often so brief that members barely had time to devour the bagels and coffee dutifully provided by the staff, much less the subject at hand. Not so these days in the new reform-minded Albany. In important new ways, the public has been invited to the table -- at least for now.\n        The Assembly Codes Committee meeting last week was an excellent example. The issue was reforming New York's bottle redemption law, and for once nobody knew in advance how the committee would vote on this vast improvement to a valuable state law.\n        The bill includes two very good ideas. One is to add bottles containing tea, water and fruit juice to the law, which now covers bottles holding beer and carbonated drinks. It makes no sense that a bottle that once held fizzy water can be redeemed for a nickel but a bottle that contained flat water cannot.\n        The second improvement involves serious money. Many redeemable bottles don't get returned to the store, and the nickel deposits that consumers paid stay with bottlers and distributors. Those nickels add up to about $100 million a year or maybe more. The new bill would take back those nickels for unredeemed containers and put the money to public use -- in recycling programs, for example.\n        Unsurprisingly, those who keep the nickels now do not want to give them up. Lobbyists for the soda, beer and grocery industries think this bill is, as one grumbled after the vote, \"an abomination.''\n        Last Tuesday, in a long, narrow committee room, lobbyists from both sides hovered over the committee members. On one side were the men in dark, expensive suits. On the other side was a small army of environmentalists, bright bottle-bill stickers on their lapels. The clean-environment crowd clearly had the numbers. The suits had the clout -- campaign donations to be given or withheld.\n        As everyone watched breathlessly, all but six committee members voted to send the bill on to the next level, a success for the environmentalists. Two assemblymen said to be wavering, Kenneth P. Zebrowski of Rockland County and James Gary Pretlow of Westchester, decided in favor of the bill. Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright of Manhattan, who had also declared himself undecided, was among those who voted against it. Mr. Wright said later he was worried about the small stores that would have more redeemable bottles to deal with.\n        The bill offers relief to smaller businesses in several ways. It increases the handling fee that bottlers must pay to stores that accept recycled containers. It also offers incentives to communities to create redemption centers so consumers can bypass the grocery stores altogether. In New York City, stores near redemption centers could drastically limit the number of containers they accept.\n        As the lobbyists from both sides know all too well, this is only the first punch in a very long fight. But it will be a fair fight only if it's in the open, and openness is something new in Albany, especially when legislators are forced to make a public choice between a good cause and campaign donations.","adu_anecdote":17,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1831163,"ids":1831163,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Venezuela and its demagogic president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, won't get a visit from President Bush. But Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's appeal will be very much on Mr. Bush's mind when he visits Latin America over the next week.\n        That's actually a healthy development.\n        If your taste runs to three-hour speeches, chiseling away at democracy and a world-class personality cult, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez is your man. But if the goal is to lift millions of people out of grinding poverty, only a major effort by the United States -- the hemisphere's biggest economy and strongest democracy -- can make a serious difference. And if it takes Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's demagogy to spur Washington toward more enlightened policies in the Americas, so be it.\n        Concern over the popularity of Fidel Castro inspired the pro-democracy, pro-development policies of the Alliance for Progress during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, one of the happier periods of inter-American relations.\n        In recent years, Washington has looked at Latin America with tunnel vision. It has selectively concerned itself with issues that have important political constituencies in the United States, like drug trafficking, immigration, military cooperation and trade and investment liberalization. And it has shortchanged many of the issues that matter most to Latin Americans, like development, poverty reduction, access to credit, education and health care.\n        Mr. Bush should use this trip, which will take him to Brazil, Uruguay, Guatemala, Colombia and Mexico, to start a new version of the alliance, one intended to reinforce democracy across the region. He should commit himself to ensuring that the benefits of expanded trade and investment reach the millions of Latin America's urban and rural poor, not just the usual narrow elites.\n        He needs to challenge the uneven human rights performance of allies like Colombia and Guatemala. Washington's double standard on human rights undercuts its credibility when pointing to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez's intimidation and prosecution of critics.\n        The White House is promoting this tour as part of a new push to promote social justice in the hemisphere, and it cites a raft of what it calls new administration initiatives to that end. But a close examination reveals that many of these consist of little more than a repackaging of existing programs, including H.I.V.\/AIDS spending, debt relief, the Millennium Challenge program and trade agreements.\n        Still, the list includes some new and potentially useful ideas, like additional help for financing affordable mortgages, small business loans and health care training. These need to be significantly expanded. Mr. Bush deserves praise for doubling the assistance to Latin America, to $1.6 billion a year. But much of this has been for security programs in Colombia. A lot more will be needed if promoting social justice is to be more than a sound bite.\n        When Mr. Bush first ran for president seven years ago, he said that as governor of Texas, he had a special understanding of, and empathy for, Latin America. With Washington's reputation in the hemisphere nearing its modern nadir, there could hardly be a better time to put that understanding and empathy to work.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1828382,"ids":1828382,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"Vigorous competition in the private sector has served the United States economy and consumers extremely well, providing a greater array of choices, more innovation and lower prices. The two -- and only -- satellite radio companies are now eager to merge and are arguing that together, they will prove to be the exception to the rule.\n        The industry is important and still young. We urge regulators to take a hard look at the companies' proposal before leaving the field in the hands of a single player.\n        Sirius and XM provide subscription radio services for some 14 million customers, with each company beaming more than 100 channels of music and talk radio, much of it without commercials. The services -- both less than six years old -- have generated considerable excitement with things like high-profile and high-price deals, including the $725 million in cash and stock that the shock-jock Howard Stern is reported to have signed for.\n        Together the two services have also managed to accumulate $6 billion in losses since receiving their licenses a decade ago.\n        The companies' managers argue that the $13 billion merger could finally make them profitable by letting them cut costs and redundant programs, while giving consumers more programming options for their bucks. As for the fear of creating a monopoly, they argue that competition will still come from terrestrial radio (commonly known as AM and FM), iPods and other next-generation technologies.\n        It is important to remember that these are not widget makers. Radios carry important discourse and debate -- they are vital to the free exchange of ideas protected by the First Amendment. Recent experience shows that media consolidation usually leads to more homogeneous content, politically as well as artistically, and it rarely benefits the consumer or the country.\n        There is also the question of what precedent would be set if regulators accepted the broadest possible definition of audio competition, and whether that could lead to even more mergers in radio. No less troubling are reports that the companies believe that they have an incentive to merge before the Bush administration and its overly friendly-to-business regulators leave office.\n        The companies should, of course, be allowed to argue their case. And consumers should voice their opinions as well. Unless they want to pay for both services, subscribers are currently missing out on exclusive shows: Mr. Stern can be heard only on Sirius, and the nation's empathizer in chief, Oprah Winfrey, only on XM. Sports fans who want football and baseball have to pay for both services.\n        Consumers should also recognize that XM and Sirius compete vigorously for customers, talent and corporate partners. Both even charge the same rate, $12.95 a month, a price that might well rise if there was no competition.\n        When XM's and Sirius's licenses were granted, the Federal Communications Commission stipulated that ''one licensee will not be permitted to acquire control of the other.'' The chairman of the F.C.C., Kevin Martin, reiterated that point this week but left the door open to a possible merger, saying, ''The companies would need to demonstrate that consumers would clearly be better off with both more choice and affordable prices.''

Despite Mr. Bush's impatience, there's plenty of time to try to find out: the American shield and the Iranian missiles it's supposed to deflect are years away from working.\n        The presidents' kiss-and-make-up session shouldn't erase Mr. Putin's earlier threats that Moscow would retarget its weapons against Europe if Washington went ahead with plans to build the system there.\n        The mathematics of his dudgeon never added up. Ten rudimentary missile interceptors would pose no threat to the thousands of sophisticated weapons in Russia's nuclear arsenal. So if you suspect that Mr. Putin was trying to divert attention from his own multiple sins -- abusing civil liberties, bludgeoning his neighbors -- you're probably right. Still, his shrill posturing was an important reminder of just how much of the Cold War's nastiest business is still unfinished.\n        Go back to the mathematics for a moment. Nearly two decades after the Berlin Wall came down the United States and Russia together still have nearly 25,000 nuclear weapons -- including 6,000 long-range weapons deployed and ready to launch. By 2012, the two sides are each supposed to cut their number of deployed weapons to around 2,000. But under the terms of the 2002 Moscow Treaty, there are no restrictions on how many weapons they can keep in reserve. Mr. Bush never wanted a binding agreement. In a particularly grudging touch, the Moscow Treaty's limits expire the day they go into effect. And since 2002, thanks to Mr. Bush, there have been no serious discussions about any further arms cuts.\n        The president and his aides ridicule anyone who advocates new agreements with our no-longer-enemies, the Russians, as mired in old think. There are so many things wrong with that approach that it's hard to know where to start.\n        Mr. Putin's posturing should first be a reminder that friendship can be fleeting. The dangers of accidental launch or theft that come with such huge arsenals are the stuff of nightmares. And then there's the whole ''do as I say, not as I do'' problem. Mr. Bush would have a lot more credibility when he tries to block the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea if he were championing a genuine effort to keep reducing the world's two largest arsenals rather than blocking it.\n        Mr. Bush has invited Mr. Putin to his family home in Kennebunkport next month. We hope the elder Mr. Bush -- a real believer in that ''old think'' -- is around. Maybe he could persuade his son to put the unfinished business of thousands of nuclear weapons where it belongs: on the top of the agenda.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1825489,"ids":1825489,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Voters in central Brooklyn do not lack for choices in the February 20th special election to fill the City Council seat vacated by Yvette Clarke.

For instance, Steven Greenhouse and Michael Barbaro reported yesterday in The Times that employees at several Florida stores say that managers are barring older employees with back and leg problems from using stools they had sat on for years.\n        Other employees are complaining of sudden scheduling changes they say are skewed to chase out long-term employees, and wage caps that act as a disincentive for those longer-tenured workers. In a stunning deployment of corporate doublespeak, a memo to store managers describes the wage caps as a way to maintain ''internally equitable pay levels.'' It is true that if everyone is making the same everyday low wages, a perverse form of equality is established among them.\n        The company says it is not trying to encourage long-term employees to leave, and that the caps encourage them to move up if they want higher pay. Other retailers impose wage caps, the company argues. It is true that Wal-Mart falls under particular scrutiny, but it is in no small measure because it the largest private employer in the country. And, as that internal document last year noted, poorly compensated part-time workers lacking benefits will turn to government programs for the needy instead, a form of backdoor taxpayer subsidy.\n        But Costco has shown that better wages for workers don't preclude low prices for customers. If Wal-Mart wants to avoid increasingly onerous legislation, regulation and scrutiny, company executives are going to have to learn that human beings are not machines that can be turned on and off, that parents can't always reshuffle their lives on short notice.\n        As a business, Wal-Mart minimizes costs and maximizes profits. Society says what is fair, sets the rules of the game through government, and imposes minimum standards. Congress must act to raise the minimum wage, which has sat at a paltry $5.15 an hour since 1997, and reform the teetering health-insurance system. Right now, it's sending the wrong message to companies like Wal-Mart.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1810444,"ids":1810444,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Watching our elected leaders in action, it's not surprising that Americans wonder if there is any limit to the crass misbehavior that members of Congress are willing to tolerate from their colleagues to protect their privileges and hold on to their own jobs. The House ethics committee answered that question yesterday with a resounding ''No.''\n        Sixty-four days after it promised to find out who knew about Representative Mark Foley's wildly inappropriate, sexually predatory behavior with teen-age House pages, and why they failed to stop it, the bipartisan committee produced a report yesterday that was a 91-page exercise in cowardice.\n        The report's authors were clearly more concerned about protecting the members of the House than the young men and women under their charge in the page program. And they made absolutely no effort to define the high standard of behavior that should be required of all members of Congress and their staffs.\n        The report concludes that evidence of Mr. Foley's ''creepy'' interest in young male pages dated back to 1999. One woman who worked with the pages took to shadowing Mr. Foley when he was around them. The report makes clear that Mr. Foley's misconduct became known to an ever-widening circle of his colleagues and their aides, including Speaker Dennis Hastert. But no one made any serious attempt to stop Mr. Foley or reveal his misdeeds. A few urged him to cut it out, for political reasons, but did not follow up.\n        The committee concluded that other people preferred to remain willfully ignorant -- to protect Mr. Foley's secret homosexuality, to avoid partisan embarrassment or for other political reasons.\n        But even after all that, the report said that none of this amounted to the sort of behavior that might discredit the House of Representatives and thus violate ethics rules. The committee, which never heard from Mr. Foley, did not call for disciplinary action against current members of the House or their staffs. The committee said those who have already left, like Mr. Foley, were no longer its problem.\n        The panel's justification for inaction is a breathtaking exercise in sophistry: ''the requirement that House members and staff act at all times in a manner that reflects creditably on the House does not mean that every error in judgment or failure to exercise greater oversight or diligence'' is a violation.\n        No, not every error or failure should be a violation, but certainly the ones that lead to an elected official's sexually stalking teenage boys while his colleagues turn a blind eye or cover it up should be. We'd set the bar at least there. Apparently, it's too high for the House.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":4,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1811521,"ids":1811521,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"We are disappointed that the Supreme Court has upheld a defendant's conviction even though spectators at his trial put prejudicial material in sight of the jury. Fortunately, the court made clear that its ruling this week was based only on the unusual way the issue was raised, and that it was not deciding when this kind of politicking from the audience violated the Constitution. The decision should prompt courts to think about how to ensure that courtroom atmosphere does not deprive defendants of a fair trial.\n        At Mathew Musladin's murder trial in California, the dead man's family sat in the front of the spectators' gallery wearing buttons with their relative's picture. The key issue at trial was which of the two men was the aggressor in a fight, and the photographs were essentially an argument that the deceased was the innocent victim.\n        Mr. Musladin was convicted in state court, but a federal appeals court overturned his conviction. A federal court can do this only if it finds that a state court violated ''clearly established federal law.'' In this case, the appeals court decided the state court had, since the Supreme Court had ruled in an analogous case that forcing a defendant to stand trial in prison garb sent a message of guilt to the jury and thus violated his right to a fair trial.\n        The Supreme Court upheld Mr. Musladin's conviction, reversing the appeals court. It ruled that the court was wrong about there being ''clearly established federal law'' in this area. It decided, not all that convincingly, that the prison garb case was different from Mr. Musladin's case because the government, not private citizens, was sending the prejudicial message.\n        The Supreme Court emphasized that it was not deciding whether photographs of the kind worn at Mr. Musladin's trial violated the Constitution; that remains an open question. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing separately, advised courts to consider when spectators infringe on a defendant's fair-trial rights.\n        Justice Kennedy is right. A victim's family has every right to attend a trial. But judges must ensure that criminal defendants are judged on the evidence, and nothing more. If Mr. Musladin's case is at all typical, it suggests that many courts do not have clear, uniform rules about what sort of spectator actions are impermissible. Court systems around the country should take Justice Kennedy's advice and set appropriate standards that preserve defendants' right to a fair trial.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1749347,"ids":1749347,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"We don't generally approve of holding nominations hostage to other political objectives. But Senators Hillary Clinton and Patty Murray surely have good cause to block a vote on the nomination of Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach to become commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration until the agency makes a final decision on the morning-after pill. There is no excuse for the administration's endless obfuscation and delays on making the pill available without a prescription when the overwhelming bulk of expert opinion says it is safe to do so. The pill must be taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, preferably within 24 hours, leaving little time to visit a doctor to get a prescription.\n        The two senators, both Democrats, have good reason to feel betrayed. When they threatened last year to hold up the confirmation of a previous commissioner until a decision on the pill was made, they ultimately relented because of a written assurance from Michael Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, who said the F.D.A. would act on the issue by Sept. 1. Sadly, Mr. Leavitt was misinformed by the agency, overruled by the White House or deliberately deceptive with the senators. The only action the agency took in September was to defer a decision indefinitely.\n        The case for approving the use of the pill without a prescription has become even stronger in recent months. Evidence has emerged that high officials at the agency overruled their professional staff and ignored expert advisory committees when they rejected the application. Moreover, the agency's claim that it needed more time to consider ''novel'' issues raised by a proposal to require prescriptions for young teenagers was belied by internal documents revealing that the issues had been discussed for some time but not analyzed aggressively. The logical inference is that the result was dictated by politics -- by a desire to placate religious and social conservatives who consider the pill an invitation to promiscuity and an abortifacient.\n        Should this nomination ultimately go forward, senators will still need to assess the qualifications of Dr. von Eschenbach, who has been acting commissioner since last September. He is a respected surgeon and was president-elect of the American Cancer Society. But his record as director of the National Cancer Institute, a post he holds even as he runs the F.D.A., gets mixed reviews.\n        His goal to eliminate death and suffering from cancer by 2015 is deemed visionary by some, but wildly unrealistic by others. His desire to bring medicines to market more quickly and more cheaply wins plaudits from the drug industry and some patient advocates, but criticism from consumer advocates who worry that safety will be undermined.\n        There is little likelihood that the Senate will reject Dr. von Eschenbach's nomination in a floor vote, although the senators could at least push him for guarantees that safety issues will not be submerged in the rush to approve new drugs and conquer cancer. But the vote should not take place until the F.D.A. has the spine to tackle the morning-after pill head-on.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1844052,"ids":1844052,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"We have all seen how presidential candidates shift positions to impress primary voters. It's usually as measured and boring as dance instruction: O.K. everyone, now dip to the right -- or left -- then back to center. But on the volatile topic of immigration, Republicans are lurching, falling over themselves to convince voters that where they stand is not where they stood.\n        The fakery is hard to watch, as it comes at a time when courage and bipartisan realism are critically important. The Iowa maunderings of two candidates in particular -- Senators Sam Brownback and John McCain -- have complicated the prospects of a bipartisan immigration bill that would affect millions of lives. While the bill's fate is being decided in difficult closed-door negotiations in the Capitol, they and other G.O.P. hopefuls are on the stump, tying themselves in knots on ''amnesty'' and dancing farther out to the fringes of public opinion.\n        Mr. Brownback is a right-wing Republican whose religion teaches compassion for the stranger -- immigrants, too. He was a co-sponsor of last year's bipartisan Senate bill. But this year he bailed out of negotiations, and last week disowned his vote for last year's bill, to the delight of conservatives who scorned him as ''Amnesty Sam.''\n        Mitt Romney is also going through contortions. The Boston Globe posted audio clips of Mr. Romney praising, in 2005, an immigration bill sponsored by Mr. McCain and Senator Edward Kennedy as sensible and ''quite different'' from amnesty, then dissing it as amnesty in this year's campaign. Mr. Romney now wallows in the support of Joe Arpaio, the showboating Phoenix sheriff famous for humiliating prisoners and pushing a round-'em-all-up approach.\n        Rudolph Giuliani has sharply changed his tone. Once a stout defender of immigrants, Mr. Giuliani now talks about sending people to the back of the line and installing ''heat-seeking equipment'' at the border. He insists that he opposes amnesty, but the ''amnesty'' he objects to is an ''amnesty'' nobody is talking about -- blanket forgiveness, a free pass to a green card. Once you hear him talking about helping immigrants who pay fines and back taxes, stay out of trouble, learn English and wait in the back of the visa line, it seems clear that he belongs in the comprehensive-reform fold with Mr. Kennedy and others -- whether he admits it or not.\n        Of all the retreats, the most disheartening may be Mr. McCain's. This former straight talker once lent his name to the most promising immigration bill in Congress. But as Senator Kennedy has struggled to draft a compromise this year, his former partner has been trumpeting border security on the campaign trail and letting momentum for comprehensive reform stall in Washington.\n        Mr. McCain and his adversaries may believe that primary politics demands such behavior, but surveys of the larger populace tell a different story. Americans want the immigration issue solved, and they strongly favor ''amnesty,'' whether you call it that or not. An array of recent polls show powerful support for an earned path to citizenship.\n        ''Call it a banana if you want to,'' Mr. McCain said of the amnesty debate last year, in a welcome moment of lucidity. If a good bill emerges, it will be because enough lawmakers stayed focused and kept their heads. If the effort collapses, a large share of the blame must go to amnesty-fixated Republicans lost in the fog of the 2008 presidential race.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1685736,"ids":1685736,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"We have been incredibly fortunate that there has not been a major terrorist attack in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001. But yesterday's horrific news from London is a reminder that to make the nation safer, the Bush administration and Congress need to do more than raising the terror alert.\n        Several important steps should be taken right away. But influential industries and members of Congress have blocked these common-sense solutions, putting their narrow interests ahead of the national interest. They have been helped by a growing sense of complacency, which has been fueled by the idea that the absence of attacks means the threat is gone. If the Madrid train attack last year did not change that thinking, yesterday's events certainly should. President Bush, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and leaders of Congress should take fast action on these fronts:\n        Increased security for mass transit -- The federal government has poured billions into airline security, while badly shortchanging railroads, buses and subways. Some lawmakers have unsuccessfully fought this financial imbalance. Now it is clear that aviation is not the only, and perhaps not even the primary, form of transportation threatened by terrorists. Congress should sharply increase the funds for rail, bus and subway security.\n        A risk-based financing formula -- Just as London was an obvious place for an attack, parts of the United States are particularly likely targets. The 9\/11 commission recommended that antiterrorism funds be allocated solely based on risk, but some members of Congress have been trying to set aside much of the money for low-risk areas. That is irresponsible. Congress should base as much of its financing plan as possible -- ideally, 100 percent -- on risk.\n        A tough chemical-plant security law -- There are more than 100 plants where an attack would endanger the lives of a million or more people. Despite the enormity of the threat, Congress has refused to impose reasonable safety rules, largely because of pressure from the chemical industry. Senators Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, have been working hard on the issue. They should come up with a strong bill, and Congress should pass it without delay.\n        A tough chemical transport law -- Deadly chemicals are shipped by rail into major cities every day. A simple attack on a tanker car could kill as many as 100,000 people in 30 minutes. Often these shipments could be easily redirected, but shippers do not want the added expense.

But it wasn't over a major principle, like the collapse of Congressional supervision of the executive branch or the incredibly lax security in the nation's ports, or even the security issues posed by this particular deal.\n        The Republicans dumped the ports deal into the harbor because of xenophobia and electoral tactics. Republican pollsters have been saying the president could be a liability in the fall elections, so lawmakers posed as rebels for voters who, they think, want rebels. They know those voters are unhappy about globalization, and specifically hostile toward Arabs.\n        The idea that a happy few are charging the White House ramparts is ridiculous. Republican lawmakers don't just turn a blind eye when they learn that the president is making profoundly bad choices, like cutting constitutional corners, abrogating treaties and even breaking the law. They actually legalize the president's misdeeds.\n        Take domestic spying, held up as another area of Republican revolt. The program violates the law. Congress knows it. The public knows it. Even President Bush knows it. (He just says the law doesn't apply to him.) In response, the Capitol Hill rebels are boldly refusing to investigate the program -- or any other warrantless spying that is going on. They are trying to rewrite the law to legalize warrantless spying. And meanwhile, they've created new subcommittees to help the president go on defying the law.\n        Over the last couple of years, Republican lawmakers have been given proof that American soldiers and intelligence agents abused, tortured and even killed prisoners, or sent them to other countries to be tortured. Without hesitation, the Republicans did nothing -- no serious investigation, no accountability.\n        Congressional and White House negotiators then watered down the new anti-torture law, which Mr. Bush said did not really apply to him anyway. And they passed another law actually encouraging the abuse of prisoners by allowing the use of coerced evidence at hearings on the prisoners' status.\n        After 9\/11, Mr. Bush created a network of prisons outside the American legal system so he could hold people indefinitely without any hearings. When the Supreme Court said twice that he was reaching beyond his powers, the Republicans in Congress were determined not to let this assault on the rule of law continue. So they rose as one, and legalized the president's actions. In case there was any confusion about its resolve, Congress told the courts that they could no longer rule on these matters. Mr. Bush got the message, loud and clear. He sent his lawyers right out to inform the judges, including the Supreme Court, that they had to drop all the cases that were already before them.\n        And all this does not even include the act of open rebellion by which the Senate is helping the White House cover up the hyping of intelligence on Iraq.\n        With rebels like these, who needs loyalists?","adu_anecdote":15,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1759538,"ids":1759538,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"We must not spend a billion dollars to build a 9\/11 memorial at ground zero. That much is clear. The only thing a $1 billion memorial would memorialize is a complete collapse of political and private leadership in Lower Manhattan.\n        We've often said on this page that the memorial should be built as soon as possible. But the cost estimate made public this week -- prepared by Bovis Lend Lease, the construction manager, at the request of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation -- has given everyone pause. It isn't merely the fact that the number is so high: $972 million and rising. It's also the fact that the task of planning a buildable memorial has fallen into such disarray.\n        What began as a public process to choose a memorial design -- the winner, you may recall, was Michael Arad's ''Reflecting Absence'' -- has slowly turned into something else. And it's something that looks very much like design-by-committee. Nearly everyone has a stake, and often a self-contradictory stake, in what the memorial will become, including the city, the Port Authority, the memorial foundation and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, not to mention a small but increasingly vocal contingent of 9\/11 families who oppose Mr. Arad's design.\n        The political and emotional pressures on the memorial have been confused still further by a new assessment of security concerns. They threaten the basic integrity of the memorial design, which has already been compromised by consultants working for the development corporation. This is a recipe for chaos.\n        Two things should happen right away. A competent entity needs to be put in charge of building the memorial. That should be the Port Authority, which has far and away the best track record among the concerned parties.\n        Second, there needs to be a comprehensive analysis of Bovis's cost estimates. Once that's been done, it will be time to examine the alternatives, and their costs, at ground zero. Those may well include delaying the museum until the primary task of building a memorial is completed. The museum was not part of the original design competition. The memorial foundation rightly emphasizes the need for a place to present artifacts from 9\/11, to interpret the events of that day and to educate the public about them. But at this point, most of us still remember that day very clearly. What we need right now is a place on the site to contemplate what stood at ground zero and how it fell, and to honor the victims. The museum can come later, and perhaps be elsewhere.\n        The memorial design itself will clearly need to be re-examined in light of these new cost estimates and security concerns. We are not committed to preserving all the details of ''Reflecting Absence.'' But we are committed to the process by which it was chosen.\n        The plan must be reconsidered in a way that directly involves Mr. Arad, who has been shunted aside, and the public, whose engagement is essential. As things stand now, there is a serious risk that the essential dignity of the original design -- its austere contemplativeness -- will be sacrificed to confusion and the concerns of narrow interests operating behind the scenes.","adu_anecdote":14,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1685735,"ids":1685735,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"We watched the scenes of mass murder in the heart of London yesterday with a cascade of emotions, starting with raw outrage. Memories of Sept. 11, 2001, flooded back -- the slow realization of the magnitude of that crime, the nagging worry that we had not seen the end of it. The images were tragically familiar: the bloodied faces as survivors trudged to the light through smoky darkness, screaming sirens and terrified onlookers.\n        But the familiarity does nothing to mitigate the pain of those who lost loved ones, of the many injured and of the millions of Londoners who watched as the weekday morning calm in their city was shattered by the bestiality of people capable of setting off bombs in packed subway trains and a crowded bus.\n        The anger and pain mixed with admiration for the strength and calm of those who live in a place that has seen more than its share of domestic tragedy: the bombings by Nazi warplanes more than a half-century ago, and the mindless terrorism of Irish militants more recently.\n        Sadly, this attack came just at a moment when there were glimmers of hope and unity. The day before, London had won the right to be host of the Olympics, that great display of international understanding and peaceful competition. And on the morning of the bombings, Prime Minister Tony Blair, President Bush and the leaders of six other rich and powerful nations were meeting in Scotland to work out a common plan to help those who live in despair in places like Africa, where poverty and disease breed resentment among those who have nothing for those who have so much. That juxtaposition of hope and fear is an integral weapon of the terrorist, who seeks not only to destroy life and property but also to disrupt our lives in ways that bring more destruction.\n        Fear was another inescapable response -- the natural fear that this kind of attack, carried out by people with no regard for their own lives or anyone else's, could happen anywhere.\n        That fear has already led to questions about why the British security agencies did not anticipate the attacks, why the wealthy nations have not done enough about the root causes of terrorism and why Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden continue to function after almost four years of the so-called war on terrorism. Many will wonder why the United States is mired in Iraq while Al Qaeda's leader still roams free.\n        There are no easy answers to these questions, just as there is no easy defense against acts of terrorism. What ordinary people can do is to carry on. Just as the world leaders kept meeting in Scotland yesterday, we can go back into the subway (and the London Underground when it is reopened), back onto the streets and back to work.\n        Terrorist acts are meant to show us how thin the veneer of order and decency in the world is, but they can demonstrate just the opposite if we use them to deepen our commitment to the richness and civility of our lives.

But we doubt it.\n        It was just last month that intelligence officials, with their bosses' clear blessings, were insisting that Iran's leaders had personally ordered the smuggling of especially lethal roadside bombs into Iraq. At least they did until the Pentagon's top general admitted that no one knew who in Iran was really calling those shots, and President Bush announced that it didn't matter anyway.\n        So we suspect that this week's confessions of doubt about North Korea had less to do with a sudden burst of candor than the fact that Pyongyang has agreed to readmit nuclear inspectors -- who probably won't be able to find the active uranium enrichment program the administration has been alleging for more than four years. Add to that the White House's eagerness for a diplomatic win in these bleak times -- and its insistence that a nuclear deal cannot go ahead if the North is believed to be hiding things -- and you understand why the White House might find this truth so convenient.\n        Late may be better than never, but it isn't nearly enough to make up for the damage caused. And we haven't even raised the issue of Iraq and its long-gone weapons.\n        Let's be clear. The North Koreans had and have an illicit nuclear arms program. They tested a device from their plutonium-based program last October. And Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has admitted that North Korea bought some 20 centrifuges -- useful only for enriching uranium -- from Abdul Qadeer Khan's nuclear black market.\n        The problem is that the Bush administration eagerly spun those 20 centrifuges into an industrial-scale enrichment program, and then used it as an excuse to scuttle a Clinton-era deal to close down the North's plutonium-based weapons program. Four years later, the North set off that test.\n        And while we are pleased that the administration has finally managed to negotiate an agreement to start shutting down the North's nuclear complex, there is no guarantee that Pyongyang will ever give up its weapons.\n        If that's not bad enough, consider some frightening truths. There is no doubt that Iran is moving ever closer to mastering the skills it will need to produce the fuel for a nuclear weapon -- and blithely defying the Security Council's demand that it stop. But even America's closest European allies have little stomach for a showdown with Tehran, while Russia and China have strong economic incentives to look the other way. Which means that Washington is the only one left out there to warn the world about the dangers of a nuclear-capable Iran.\n        Make no mistake: there are real and present dangers out there.

Yesterday, when Mr. Bush added a ringing endorsement of his own policy to his speech on terrorism, it was that same old formula: the wrong questions, the wrong answers and no new direction.\n        Mr. Bush suggested that people who doubt that nation-building is going well are just confusing healthy disagreement with dangerous division. ''We've heard it suggested that Iraq's democracy must be on shaky ground because Iraqis are arguing with one another,'' he scoffed. What he failed to acknowledge was that the Iraqi power groups seem prepared to go through the motions of democracy only as long as their side wins.\n        Just this week, the United Nations narrowly averted disaster when it convinced Shiite and Kurdish officials to drop a plan to fix the upcoming constitutional referendum to eliminate Sunni voters' capacity to vote down the constitution. But their promises to follow the rules seem likely to hold up only as long as the game goes as they want.\n        Americans want to believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel in Iraq, and Mr. Bush offered quite a bit. ''Area by area, city by city, we're conducting offensive operations to clear out enemy forces and leaving behind Iraqi units to prevent the enemy from returning,'' he said. Best of all, there were ''more than 80 Iraqi Army battalions fighting the insurgency alongside our forces.'' Unfortunately, the real questions are how many of the cleared-out towns actually stay clear once American troops have gone, and how many Iraqi units are capable of fighting on their own, without American soldiers at their side. In both cases, the answers are far more dismal than Mr. Bush suggested.\n        As a candidate, Mr. Bush got a lot of mileage out of offering the same simple, positive thoughts over and over. But now the nation doesn't need more specious theories about why the invasion was a good idea and cheery assurances that the original plan is still working. If Mr. Bush still cannot acknowledge the flaws in his policy, how can he fix them?\n        Americans need clear guidelines for judging how long it makes sense to stay in Iraq. Are our troops helping create a nation, or simply delaying an inevitable civil war? Does a continued American presence help push the Middle East toward peace and democracy, or simply inflame hatred of the United States and serve as a rallying point for Al Qaeda? The fact that the president isn't willing even to raise the questions does not increase confidence in the ultimate outcome.\n        Given the state of the American adventure in Iraq and the way it has sapped the strength and flexibility of the United States armed forces, it was unnerving to hear Mr. Bush talk so menacingly about Syria and Iran. It was also maddening to listen to him describe the perils that Iraq poses while denying that his policies set them in motion.\n        It is hard to argue with his assertion that if militants controlled Iraq, they would be well positioned ''to develop weapons of mass destruction, to destroy Israel, to intimidate Europe, to assault the American people and to blackmail our government into isolation.'' It is also hard to resist the temptation to say he should have thought of that before invading.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1682080,"ids":1682080,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Weather is not primarily a moral affair. We do not deserve a long, slow patch of hot weather, like the one that sat on the city in early June, any more than we deserve the extraordinarily beautiful evenings that have come with these longest days of the year. Deserving has nothing to do with it. The weather comes, it goes, and sometimes it's occluded. The days of seeing the wrath of God in a prolonged drought or a heavy windstorm -- believing that bad weather chastens our bad actions, in other words -- are pretty much past. One sobering irony of global warming is the thought that it threatens to make weather moral again in a very different way.\n        But these are thoughts too puzzling for the fine weather of these last few evenings, when it is almost impossible not to feel that this has come to us by right -- as our due after a run of sticky days and as the best of what the month of June has to offer anyway.\n        These are the nights for stoop sitting, not in long-suffering, as though we felt the curse of Cain on our shoulders, but like the young man and his dog I passed the other evening. Both sat quietly, watching the street. You could tell that what they were really doing was feeling the shape of the cool air around their bodies. It would have been a pleasure in itself, but it was all the more pleasurable for the memory of that hot spell.\n        On a long, horizontal evening, when the whole sky seems to have slipped westward, New York becomes a different city. The weary tension embedded in a heat wave has slipped away, and a kind of expansiveness comes over the neighborhoods again, as if people could suddenly see and hear each other again now that the stale air has been dispelled.\n        I took a taxi up Central Park West the other night, and at every block, a small colony of neighbors from the buildings nearby had settled under the trees and on the benches in the park. The temperature was in the mid-60's, and the sky in the west was breaking up in a way that was part Remington and part Turner. A pair of schoolgirls playfully slapped each other on a bench while the boy next to them stared at his cellphone. The light from the streetlamps drifted down upon them.\n        This is a city of stone and metal, but it's softened by the fact that we live in a world of probabilities, not certainties. When the hot weather squelches us, and New Jersey disappears in the brown fug, it's easy to become grateful for the simple fact that the earth revolves, setting up currents that will eventually blow this stuff away.\n        Of course, the long, cool nights will blow away too, much as we would like them to linger.

Arnold Schwarzenegger of California has warned that he will sue the Environmental Protection Agency unless it gives him the power to regulate automobile emissions. A New York Times\/CBS News Poll shows that an overwhelming majority of Americans now want immediate steps to deal with global warming. And a leaked draft of the next report from the world's leading scientists says that the window for action is shrinking -- that what governments do over the next 20 to 30 years will determine whether the world can avoid the worst consequences of climate change.\n        Even so, Washington continues to move as slowly as a melting glacier. This week, Stephen Johnson, the E.P.A. administrator, told a Senate committee that he was still mulling the ramifications of the court's decision, and he would not say when or even whether he would regulate carbon dioxide. He promised to solicit public comments on Mr. Schwarzenegger's request but, again, would not say when or whether he would grant that request. Under the law, California can set its own emissions standards -- which other states can then adopt -- but it needs a federal waiver before putting them into effect.\n        ''I don't hear in your voice a sense of urgency,'' Senator Barbara Boxer, the committee chairwoman, told Mr. Johnson. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, was less charitable. ''You astonish me,'' he said, a criticism clearly intended for the entire administration.\n        Nobody is asking Mr. Johnson to design a comprehensive national program for regulating greenhouse gases, an enormous undertaking that is plainly Congress's responsibility. Ms. Boxer and others are simply asking the administrator to exercise the authority the court gave him.\n        That would mean promptly approving California's proposal to reduce greenhouse gases from vehicles by 30 percent by the 2016 model year. That proposal is the centerpiece of a broader state effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all sources by 25 percent by 2020.\n        California requested a waiver in 2005, but the E.P.A. -- hiding behind the now-demolished claim that it lacked the authority to regulate greenhouse gases -- has been sitting on it. Eleven other states have adopted the standards and will put them into effect as soon as California gets the green light.\n        Mr. Johnson's stalling is a symptom of a larger problem, the administration's reluctance to take seriously the science of global warming, which in turn explains its reluctance to take meaningful action. Yet the walls continue to close in, with the scientists' warnings, the Supreme Court decision, the escalating pressure from the states and the general public. If President Bush will not lead, Congress must.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1650368,"ids":1650368,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"What is continually perplexing to Gov. George Pataki's friends and even some of his foes is how he seems to be two really different people. One Governor Pataki is a Northeastern moderate Republican, a voice of reason on most social issues, a conservative on fiscal matters. That Governor Pataki has done fine work protecting the environment and leading the drive to create a worthy public monument to Sept. 11 in Lower Manhattan.\n        Yet the admirable Mr. Pataki always seems to bring along a shadowy twin. That other version appoints his buddies to high-paying jobs in state government -- like a former bodyguard who managed to get on the payroll for two different posts at one time, or a former aide who was paid almost $600,000 on a contract for services that should have cost the state less than a third of that figure.\n        That George Pataki has had more than his share of embarrassments. A former labor commissioner was convicted on bribery charges. Pataki appointees tried to sell off development rights to the Erie Canal for $30,000. Former Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Mr. Pataki's political mentor turned lobbyist, once got $500,000 from a client for making a phone call to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. And then we had Michelle Stubbs, Libby Pataki's maid-gofer-assistant, whose salary and expenses are paid by the state's Republican Party.\n        Friends of the governor say he got the party to pay for Mrs. Pataki's help because he did not want Ms. Stubbs, who does work ranging from political assistance to grocery shopping, on the state payroll. It's true that taxpayers would probably regard the Pataki family's behavior as an improvement over that of some other officials who have created state jobs for their butlers, maids and girlfriends. Still, those funds are supposed to be for party ''housekeeping,'' not for the governor's housekeeper.\n        What's far more worrisome, however, is the possibility that the governor is mixing personal finances with political fund-raising. Throughout his time as the state's chief executive, Mr. Pataki has repeatedly given the impression that he's both short on cash and open to allowing special interests to help him out with his personal expenses. The governor -- a less-than-thrilling speaker -- has collected high fees for out-of-state appearances before private groups. His wife makes more than $300,000 a year as a consultant. She is a co-author of a children's book, and, until recently, Republican groups were encouraged to support Mrs. Pataki's writing career by purchasing the books in large numbers.\n        Given the state's mediocre record on critical matters like education funds and budget reform, and Mr. Pataki's ethical problems, it's no wonder a New York Times poll published this week found the governor's approval ratings heading south.\n        Despite all that, the good Governor Pataki has joined the call for reforming Albany's broken political culture. His latest State of the State address was a public policy wish list: budget reform, contract lobbying reform, authorities reform and even campaign finance reform, which he first promised to pursue over 10 years ago. Making those issues a real priority this session and helping to turn them into law won't make the bad side of the ledger disappear. But it would certainly help put the preferable version of George Pataki back in the headlines.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1706936,"ids":1706936,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"What perfect timing: the bankruptcy law set to go into effect Oct. 17 is arriving just in time to inflict more pain on Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas residents who have been hit by the gulf hurricanes. They lost their homes, businesses and even loved ones and now may face financial ruin without the protection of bankruptcy.\n        Robert Lawless, a law professor at the University of Nevada, found in a forthcoming Nevada Law Journal study that bankruptcy filings rose about 50 percent faster in states affected by hurricanes than in those unaffected. That the Hurricane Katrina victims would suffer under the draconian new law is hard to swallow. Their plight also raises the question of whether anyone at all should be punished by this unfortunate piece of legislation.\n        The banking and credit-card companies that bankrolled the new law -- both in campaign contributions and lobbying muscle -- want us to believe that it is designed to capture wild spenders who finance lavish lifestyles before ducking behind the protection of bankruptcy when the bills come due. But this contemporary retelling of the myth of the welfare queen dissolves under scrutiny.\n        What most bankruptcy filers have in common is a huge setback beyond their control, like illness, the death of a loved one, divorce or layoffs. Most Americans view bankruptcy as a last resort, even after a traumatic event. Mr. Lawless's study, based on 18 major storms between 1980 and 2004, found that the peak in bankruptcy filings was not right after a storm but two to three years later. That means victims made every effort to rebuild their lives before seeking help.\n        F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin congressman who was a sponsor of the bankruptcy law in the House, told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last month that those who had lost the fight against the new rules needed to ''get over it.'' Easy for him to say. His Congressional salary of more than $160,000 this year is nearly quadruple the median United States household income last year, which was less than $45,000. His great-grandfather was one of the founders of the company that brought us Kleenex and Huggies, making him an heir to the Kimberly-Clark fortune. He even once won $250,000 in the D.C. Lottery, for him just a cherry on top of a fortune reported at more than $10 million. It's a shame that Mr. Sensenbrenner, who has to be one of the luckier people around, can't spare a little sympathy for the less fortunate.\n        Sorry, Jim.

The following are not the actions of a community that knows what it is doing:\n        Officially designating a parking area in Columbus Park, near the railroad station, as a hiring site for day laborers -- then declaring it closed.\n        Branding day laborers ''locusts,'' as one village trustee did, before apologizing.\n        Participating with the village of Larchmont and the Town of Mamaroneck in a seemingly earnest public effort to find a decent alternative site to Columbus Park -- an effort that has been conducted with little enthusiasm and gone nowhere.\n        Rejecting out of hand an offer from the Westchester County Executive, Andy Spano, to allow day laborers and contractors to congregate on county-owned property on Boston Post Road.\n        Waging an aggressive, high-profile campaign of police enforcement against day laborers and contractors, with traffic stops and patrol cars with flashing lights turning sections of the village into the functional equivalent of militarized zones.\n        The crackdown seems to have sprung from a conclusion among village officials that doing something stupid was better than doing nothing at all. The plaintiffs in the utterly predictable lawsuit, represented by the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, have argued convincingly that oppressive police attention -- with threats of fines, warnings about loitering and, in one alleged instance, the detention of a day laborer for two hours without explanation -- was directed specifically and systematically at Latino men, and thus violated the Constitution in all the familiar, depressing ways.\n        A settlement seems the best way for the village to extract itself from this predicament, especially since the judge, Colleen McMahon of District Court in Manhattan, said recently that she would ''not be kindly disposed to the village of Mamaroneck'' if it became evident that the police had been singling out day laborers for special treatment.\n        It should be clear by now that in an effort to impose order on what is essentially a traffic problem, Mamaroneck officials have gotten into a legal mess, and shamed themselves in the process. Their stiff-necked enforcement actions constitute disgraceful treatment of people who had been committing the outrageous affront of looking for work -- real work, manual labor, as opposed to drug dealing, prostitution and other sidewalk crimes that normally inspire crackdowns like this.\n        The answer in Mamaroneck, as it is in any other place with a day-laborer population, is to handle this situation calmly and humanely. Let the federal government struggle with the issue of national borders and visas. If trucks are clogging the streets, tell the trucks where and how to go. If people are urinating outside because there are no toilets, set up toilets. If hundreds of day laborers are congregating peaceably for a few hours each morning in your downtown park, treat them well, and give thanks for how pretty and well-maintained your community is because of them.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1758222,"ids":1758222,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When 68 passengers became stuck on the Roosevelt Island tramway above the East River recently, a lot of people began to wonder, understandably, ''Who's in charge of this thing?''\n        The answer is that the island and its tram are managed by the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, a small, often unnoticed cog in New York State's huge shadow government.

With the Passaic River and the Great Falls to the west and New York to the east, Paterson was, in Hamilton's eyes, well-placed to become what he called the ''National Manufactory.''\n        The Industrial Revolution in America was, to a great extent, born in Paterson. The city's contribution to American urbanization, industrialization, social justice and the arts is as profound as it is, regrettably, forgotten or ignored.\n        The Secretary of the Interior, Dirk Kempthorne, may soon have a rare opportunity to restore Paterson's place in state and national history. Prodded by the state's entire congressional delegation, the federal Park Service is studying a proposal to designate the city's historic district, already a national landmark, as a national park.\n        When the study lands on Mr. Kempthorne's desk, he would do justice to a proud, beleaguered city by recommending that Congress create a new urban national park that documents and celebrates the city's role in the making of modern America.\n        Advocates for park designation say the project would cost very little money, in part because some of the historic buildings are already in public hands. Start-up costs would be about $10 million, annual operating costs about $400,000. Some of the start-up money is available through state funding, and advocates say they will be able to raise private funds to help with yearly operating costs. In other words, not much of a drain on the public treasury.\n        The danger, of course, is that a Paterson National Park could become a ''pork park,'' notable not for what it preserves but for what it reserves for patronage-hungry politicians. The system already has a few of these, and with its reputation for corruption and cronyism, New Jersey must make sure that local politicians keep their distance.\n        The positives, though, seem greatly to outweigh the negatives. A national park within the streets of Paterson not only would preserve the old mills and homes, but would further expand the Park Service's mission to include the exploits and struggles of immigrants and urban workers. The nation obviously values the vast natural treasures of the West. But it ought to be just as important to preserve reminders of the people who lived and worked in the nation's cities during a pivotal time in American history.\n        Long after Hamilton's death, Paterson became an important manufacturing center, nicknamed ''Silk City'' after its best-known textile. The city's workers, many of them Italian immigrants, led the fight for decent wages and better working conditions, culminating in a landmark strike against the silk industry in 1913.\n        The city's history and culture inspired the epic poem ''Paterson'' by William Carlos Williams, a native of Rutherford. And the natural beauty of the Great Falls, the second-largest falls east of the Mississippi, still inspires tourists from all over the world.\n        History, culture and natural beauty - the very things the Park Service seeks to preserve - make this site worthy of designation as a national park.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1661878,"ids":1661878,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When Assemblyman Felix W. Ortiz of Brooklyn introduced his ''couch potato tax'' a few years ago, he was the darling of morning television. Mr. Ortiz, a Democrat, wanted to slap a tax on candy bars, soft drinks, supersize junk food, videos, Game Boys -- anything that is contributing to an alarming epidemic of obesity among the young.\n        The idea drew a lot of one-liners -- some critics called Mr. Ortiz a member of the ''Twinkie police.'' But Mr. Ortiz is extremely serious. And this year he got a very important supporter: the powerful health workers' union in New York State, Local 1199.\n        The opposition is intense.

Bush was running for president in 2000 as a new kind of Republican -- the caring kind -- he had a ready answer for those skeptical of his moderate views on immigration. ''Family values do not stop at the Rio Grande,'' he said, again and again. He was standing up for immigrants who come here seeking better lives for their children, and he repeated the message so often that it stuck.\n        Now, like so much else in Mr. Bush's tattered slogan file, it's in danger of coming unstuck. Negotiators struggling to draft an immigration bill in Washington are being pressured by the White House and Republican leaders to gut the provisions of the law that promote the unity of immigrant families in favor of strictly employment-based programs.\n        Details are still being sweated out in private, but a draft proposal circulated by the White House and the G.O.P. would eliminate or severely restrict whole categories of family-based immigration in favor of a system that would assign potential immigrants points based on age, skills, education, income and other factors. Citizens would no longer be able to sponsor siblings and children over 21, and their ability to bring in parents would be severely limited.\n        Unattached workers with advanced degrees and corporate sponsors could do all right, but not families, not the moms, pops, sons and daughters who open groceries and restaurants, who rebuild desolate neighborhoods and inspire America with their work ethic and commitment to one another. The plan would also shut out hundreds of thousands of people who have applied for family visas under current rules and are patiently waiting because of long backlogs.\n        The goal seems to be to end what immigration restrictionists call ''chain migration,'' a tendentious term that recasts in a sinister light one of the fundamental ways America was built, and a decades-old cornerstone of our immigration policy. It's a cruel distortion that feeds fears of outsiders and fails to acknowledge that healthy immigration levels keep the economy running, particularly in a country with low unemployment and birth rates and workers who shun backbreaking, entry-level jobs.\n        America needs immigrants. Last year's bipartisan Senate bill recognized this, and raised quotas for both family and employment-based immigration. Congress should do so again. Closing the door to families would be unjust and unworkable, and a mockery of the values that conservatives profess. It would only encourage illegality by forcing people to choose between their loved ones and the law.\n        Compromise is necessary with any bill, particularly on an issue as complex as immigration. But if a deal hews so closely to the new harsh line of the White House and G.O.P that it fundamentally distorts America's pro-immigrant tradition, it would be better to ditch the whole thing and start over.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1825405,"ids":1825405,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When New Jersey authorized casino gambling for Atlantic City in 1977, gambling advocates promised that in time the casinos would help eliminate much of the blight that had long disfigured the city and would improve the lives of its residents. A few years later, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority was established to channel some of the casino's profits to these blighted areas, as well as to other areas in New Jersey needing help.\n        But apart from the Boardwalk, the areas around the casinos and some of the northern parts of the city, Atlantic City's blight is still very much with us. Poor housing, seedy motels and bars, prostitution and drug dealing -- all testify to unfulfilled promises and the need for continued help.\n        One big reason is that some of the money never reached its destination. In what was, in retrospect, an historic act of municipal chicanery, the casinos managed to persuade officials to change the law governing the development authority in ways that allowed the authority to invest in the casinos themselves. In effect, the money was recycled to the donors before its intended beneficiaries ever saw it.\n        As detailed in a Times article last month, the authority has channeled about $400 million, or more than 20 percent of the money granted since its inception, to casino projects, including the construction of thousands of new hotel rooms, 800 of them planned for the Trump Taj Mahal; $3.7 million for an IMAX theater to be built at the Tropicana Casino and Resort; and ''parking lot beautification'' at Showboat.\n        Thomas Carver, executive director of the authority and a former president of the Atlantic City casinos' trade association, defends the allocations, saying the money is being used to protect the state's financial well-being and keep the development of Atlantic City ''rolling forward.'' But it is hard to believe that the casinos, which generated $5.2 billion in revenue last year alone, could not have come up with their own financial backing for these ventures, rather than relying on handouts from the state.\n        David Sciarra, who as deputy state public advocate helped write the 1984 law creating the authority, is right when he says the agency's contributions to the casinos are a ''betrayal'' of the promise to citizens that the gambling industry had a social responsibility to invest a small portion of its revenues for better housing and neighborhoods. Until it was abolished, the public advocate's office opposed giving reinvestment grants to casino ventures.\n        Now that the office has been reconstituted by Gov. Jon Corzine, the new public advocate, Ronald Chen, should re-examine this shabby practice and propose changes in the law that would once again restrict reinvestment grants to improving blighted areas in Atlantic City and other urban areas.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1755048,"ids":1755048,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When New York State lawmakers finished the state budget on time, sort of, for the second year in a row, you could hear the backslapping from Buffalo to Bridgehampton.

The head of the World Bank (formerly No. 2 at the Pentagon) has criticized Chinese banks for ignoring environmental and human rights standards when they lend to Africa, told the White House it needs to do more to alleviate African poverty, and has vowed that corrupt officials won't be allowed to siphon off money from projects that are supposed to benefit the poor.\n        So why do so many people at the bank mistrust him -- including many of the leading shareholders? At last fall's annual meeting, European ministers insisted that the bank's board would oversee Mr. Wolfowitz's anticorruption program, to ensure that no country was punished arbitrarily.\n        That is not a vote of confidence and not a healthy state of affairs. Mr. Wolfowitz needs to figure out how to earn more than just the Bush administration's trust.\n        Some of his critics will never forgive him for championing the disastrous Iraq war. But he has compounded their suspicions, surrounding himself with a tight group of former Bush administration officials who -- true to their roots -- have little patience for explaining themselves and even less for criticism.\n        Mr. Wolfowitz and his aides did an especially poor job explaining their decisions to suspend or delay hundreds of millions of dollars in loans because of alleged corruption, feeding fears that they were settling scores. When Hilary Benn, Britain's top aid official, publicly questioned bank policies, an unidentified senior bank official dismissed Mr. Benn to The Financial Times as ''an ambitious political climber.'' That's no way to win friends or donors. Mr. Wolfowitz wrote to the paper to say that was not his view and has since visited London to patch things up, but relations remain cool.\n        Mr. Wolfowitz has yet to outline a broader vision for the bank, which might inspire his staff and rally international support. There are certainly a host of issues that need his leadership. The bank needs to give more of a voice to less wealthy and poor countries. It needs to find new ways to mobilize private sector financing. And it needs to get more deeply -- and more systematically -- involved in addressing global challenges like epidemics, sustainable energy and post-conflict reconstruction.\n        Mr. Wolfowitz deserves praise for championing debt relief for the world's poorest countries. And he is right that the bank needs to do a lot more to fight corruption, which can cripple any development effort. To be heard on these subjects, Mr. Wolfowitz will have to work harder to earn the trust of his staff, his shareholders and everyone who cares about development. He needs a more inclusive management style and a more diplomatic inner circle, and to articulate broader goals beyond stopping corruption. That way he would have the credibility to fight the good fight.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1804923,"ids":1804923,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When President Bush announced in September that he was transferring 14 men suspected of heinous acts of terrorism to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, his aim was baldly political -- to stampede Congress into passing a profoundly flawed law that set up military tribunals to try ''illegal enemy combatants'' and absolved U.S. officials of liability for illegally detaining and torturing prisoners.\n        But that cynical White House move may also have unintentionally provided the loose thread to unravel the secrecy and lawlessness that have cloaked the administration's handling of terrorism suspects.\n        For more than two years, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department have vigorously battled efforts to force the administration to account for the network of secret C.I.A. camps at which specially designated prisoners are hidden away. It has resisted a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union that seeks the release of documents relating to prisoner policies, including the C.I.A. prisons. Government lawyers have argued that even admitting that some documents existed would endanger national security.\n        But when Mr. Bush announced that he was sending the 14 prisoners to Guant\u00e1namo for trial, he effectively confirmed the existence of the secret C.I.A. prisons. Later, in the debate over the Military Commissions Act of 2006, Mr. Bush said that Congress had to absolve C.I.A. agents of any legal responsibility for their actions so he could order them to go on interrogating prisoners.\n        That was a major blow to the C.I.A.'s legal strategy. After all, if the president could talk about the prisons and interrogations to suit his political interests, why couldn't they be discussed in court?\n        The Justice Department quietly reversed field after Mr. Bush's announcement, and it informed the A.C.L.U. in a letter last week that two of the documents the group has been seeking do, in fact, exist -- although it is still refusing to release them.\n        One of those documents is a presidential order signed by Mr. Bush authorizing the C.I.A. to set up prisons outside the United States to house terrorism suspects. The other is a 2002 memo from the Justice Department outlining what sorts of ''aggressive interrogation techniques'' may be used against those prisoners. That phrase, we now know, is Bush administration code for acts that the rest of the world regards as abuse and even torture.\n        The government now has to file a detailed argument by the end of this month explaining why it believes these documents should not be made public.\n        Courts are sympathetic to legitimate claims of national security when it comes to intelligence and military operations. But the Bush administration has abused the courts' -- and the nation's -- trust in the indiscriminate way it has tried to hide its policies behind a supposed shield of national security. At the very least, it should now be much harder for government lawyers to do that.\n        It would be even better if the courts ultimately compelled the release of these and other documents. Americans have a right to know what standards their president has been applying to the treatment of prisoners. The nation's image is at stake, as well as the safety of every man and woman who is fighting Mr. Bush's so-called war on terror.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1779616,"ids":1779616,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When President Bush nominated John Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations last year, we argued that this convinced unilateralist and lifelong disparager of the United Nations should not be confirmed. The Senate agreed. Mr. Bush sent him to New York anyway, using the constitutional end run of a recess appointment. That appointment expires in January.\n        Now the Senate is being asked to confirm Mr. Bolton again. With one of last year's critics, George Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, having recently changed sides, confirmation seems more likely. But after a year of watching Mr. Bolton at work, we still believe the Senate should reject his nomination.\n        As ambassador, Mr. Bolton's performance has been more restrained than many of his opponents feared. He has, as far as we know, faithfully carried out any instructions he was given. And on some issues, like this spring's botched reform of the United Nations' human-rights monitoring body, Mr. Bolton was right not to accept a bad result.\n        But over all, American interests at the U.N. have suffered from Mr. Bolton's time there, and will suffer more if the Senate confirms him in the job. At a time when a militarily and diplomatically overstretched Washington needs as much international cooperation as it can get -- on Iraq, on Iran, on North Korea and now on the latest fighting between Israel and Lebanon -- Mr. Bolton is a liability, not an asset at the United Nations.\n        No ambassador, however tactful and multilateral-minded, can persuade other countries to change their votes on high-profile issues in the face of contrary instructions from their home governments. But some of the most important business that goes on in the U.N. does not fall into that category. On a wide range of issues -- winning the support of smaller countries for needed management reforms, mobilizing a strong international coalition to halt genocide in Darfur, attracting wider European support for stabilization and economic development in Iraq -- an effective ambassador can make a huge difference.\n        Mr. Bolton, by temperament and conviction, is far too dismissive of the results that can be achieved by this kind of traditional diplomacy. That is what makes him the wrong man for the job. America desperately needs to repair the alliances and relationships damaged by the shoot-from-the-hip diplomacy of the Bush first term.

''We will do what it takes,'' he said. We -- the federal, state and city governments; elected officials and the citizens who hire them -- have failed spectacularly. Homes and schools remain empty or imaginary; evacuees and survivors wait in cramped trailers, unable to return or rebuild. A huge silence still hangs over the Lower Ninth Ward, a place every American should see, to witness firsthand how truckloads of promises have filled New Orleans's vast devastation with nothing.\n        That the Lower Ninth is overwhelmingly black is not irrelevant. African-Americans were the predominant and poorest members of this city before the storm, they bore the worst of it and have the farthest journey back to stability. A study issued last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation, based on interviews last fall with residents of Orleans, Jefferson, Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes, maps the outlines of a sharp racial divide.\n        In Orleans Parish, twice as many African-Americans as whites said their lives were still ''very'' or ''somewhat'' disrupted. Seventy-two percent of blacks said they had problems getting health care, compared with 32 percent of whites. Blacks were more likely to say that their financial status, physical and mental health, and job security had worsened since the storm. And they expressed considerably more anxiety than whites about the sturdiness of the rebuilt levees, the danger from future Katrinas and the prospect of living without enough money or health care, or a decent, affordable home.\n        There was a consensus about broad categories of the recovery: solid majorities thought there had been at least some progress in restoring basic services, reopening schools and business and fixing levees. But in three vital areas -- rebuilding neighborhoods, controlling crime and increasing the supply of affordable housing -- most agreed that there had been no progress or ''not too much.''\n        Even with the constant trickle of bad news, you can find minimal improvements. Thousands of building permits have been issued. A crisis was recently averted when the Bush administration extended temporary housing assistance for tens of thousands of displaced families. Some government housing subsidies that were to expire at the end of August will continue until March 2009.\n        It is also encouraging that administration of the housing program will shift from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has always been the logical choice, given its experience in housing needy families. Other positive signs include the halting progress toward a workable redevelopment plan, and a recent finding that the city's population had grown to above half of its level before the storm.\n        The Kaiser survey even found signs of hope when it tested for resilience in a proud city. Sixty-nine percent of respondents said they were optimistic about New Orleans's future. And only 11 percent said they planned to leave.\n        Their faith must not be betrayed. Residents in the survey were keenly aware that their city's fitful recovery would be devastated if the levees failed again. They put strong levees above all other priorities, including fighting crime and even basic services like electricity and water. And yet National Geographic has reported that an engineer has found signs that levees were poorly rebuilt and are already eroding. There is no room for error here.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1749823,"ids":1749823,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria visits Washington this week, he will probably be lauded for his crucial role as a regional African leader. During his seven years in power, Mr. Obasanjo helped end Liberia's civil war by taking in the strongman Charles Taylor and refused to accept a coup in Togo. He was instrumental in making sure that the African Union did not destroy its international credibility by installing Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, as its head despite the continuing carnage in Darfur. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, the continent's other big player, could learn a lot from Mr. Obasanjo about how to use his country's economic and military strength to promote peace and stability around the region.\n        Unfortunately, while Mr. Obasanjo deserves credit for good deeds outside of Nigeria, his own country is deteriorating fast and he is partly to blame. For one thing, by trying to change Nigeria's Constitution to allow himself to run for a third four-year term as president, Mr. Obasanjo is further enflaming political tensions among Nigeria's polarized ethnic groups, particularly the Muslims in the north and Christians in the south.\n        Nigeria lost more than 100 people in tit-for-tat sectarian rioting over Danish caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. In the north, Muslims attacked and killed Christians. In the south, Christian mobs wielding machetes and knives set upon their Muslim neighbors in retaliation. And in the Niger River delta, militants seeking more local control over oil money have attacked pipelines and even captured oil workers.\n        Fueling some of this is the perception, right or wrong, that Mr. Obasanjo's much vaunted anti-corruption campaign concentrates only on critics of his government. Certainly, bad things continue to happen to foes of the Obasanjo government. Three months ago, the wife of a prominent northern politician was found stabbed to death in her home. Nothing was taken from the house, leading many to conclude that her killing was a warning to her husband, Abubakar Rimi, a crucial member of a coalition of powerful northerners opposed to any extension of Mr. Obasanjo's rule. And last week, police arrested Mr. Rimi and other opposition leaders for trying to hold a peaceful rally.\n        The last thing Africa needs is its most populous country -- Nigeria has between 120 million and 150 million people -- in a civil war. An out-of-control Nigeria would undermine its already fragile neighbors, like Liberia, Togo, Ivory Coast and the Congo.\n        In his two terms, Mr. Obasanjo has helped bring stability to a volatile region. But two terms is enough, and it is incumbent on President Bush to tell Mr. Obasanjo that changing his country's Constitution so that he can remain in office is foolhardy.

Here is his chance to use both -- leading the effort to save Westchester Medical Center.\n        The people who run the money-hemorrhaging hospital, the same ones who issued a ''financial improvement plan'' last June that promised to restore it to fiscal health in only 18 months, now say they can do so in -- well, never.\n        Never as in not ever -- unless, of course, somebody pitches in $100 million a year. The answer, in other words, is perpetual life support, either through an extension of a soon-to-expire quarter-percent New York State sales tax or annual transfusions of $20 million each from the federal, state and county governments, $20 million in cost savings and $20 million in union concessions.\n        We will not presume to guess at the right solution might be. But we can suggest a few principles to guide the search for an answer.\n        First, Westchester's problems should not be foisted on all of New York State. Backers of the sales tax would address that problem by distributing the $700 million the tax would raise so that it helps hospitals and nursing homes statewide, with about $80 million going to Westchester. Gov. George E. Pataki does not buy that argument, but if the Legislature overrides his veto, fine -- problem solved.\n        Second, any rescue plan must take shape in a climate of openness and aggressive oversight. The center is a public-benefit corporation beholden to taxpayers, since the county guarantees its bonds. But it has long operated in a culture of rosy projections and cozy secrecy, with a too-pliant board of directors and a public information staff that stonewalls media requests. The only way to manage bad news -- and the hospital has done nothing but gush bad news -- is to do so with candor.\n        Finally, the hospital needs to thoroughly evaluate the costly, money-losing services that it insists are vital to its mission. How badly does it need a burn unit, neonatal intensive care services, organ transplant program, trauma center and Medevac helicopter? There are surely strong arguments for all of these, but we would like to hear them challenged and defended. It's a cruel medical marketplace, and management needs to realize that hard choices and sacrifices are not just for unions.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1691841,"ids":1691841,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"When a Caltech astronomer, Michael Brown, announced last year that his team had found a distant object three-fourths the size of Pluto orbiting the Sun, he declined to call it a planet, and he even suggested that Pluto should not be considered a planet either. There was, he said, just no good scientific rationale for considering either of those distant bodies in the same league as the eight indisputable planets that circle the Sun at closer range.\n        Now Dr. Brown has found something orbiting the Sun that's bigger than Pluto and even farther away. He's changed his mind and proposed that Pluto keep its designation, and that the new object, an extremely big lump of ice and rock, should also be deemed a planet. There is still no good scientific rationale for the judgment, he admitted, but this is a case where habit -- 75 years of calling Pluto a planet -- should trump any scientific definition.\n        There is no real debate that the four terrestrial planets -- Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars -- and the four gaseous giants -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- deserve their status as planets. But scientists have long been uneasy about including Pluto, an icy ball smaller than our Moon, whose orbit is more eccentric than the others and tilts in a different plane.\n        Try as they might, scientists could not come up with a definition that would retain Pluto as a planet without requiring that scads of other objects be deemed planets as well. Nor could they satisfy the legions of space enthusiasts who remain certain from their grade school lessons that there are nine planets -- no more, no less.\n        So now Dr. Brown proposes that scientists give up the battle and accept a cultural definition of what a planet is. It's either the nine planets we learned about in grade school, or those nine plus any new-found object orbiting the Sun that turns out to be bigger than Pluto. He opts for the latter approach on the theory that most people, deep down, accept that definition. This definition would also, of course, qualify Dr. Brown for the historical footnotes as the discoverer of a new planet.\n        Our own preference is to take a cleaner way out by dropping Pluto from the planetary ranks. Scientists may well discover many more ice balls bigger than Pluto, and it's a safe bet that few in our culture want to memorize the names of 20 or more planets. Far better to downgrade Pluto to the status of an icy sphere that was once mistakenly deemed a planet because we had not yet discovered its compatriots on the dark fringes of the solar system.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1848655,"ids":1848655,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When a corrupt public official goes to prison, it defies common sense to reward him with a government pension for holding the job that he abused. Such a situation robs taxpayers twice: once when they pay the salary of a dishonest official who uses his job to break the law and again when they pay for his retirement.\n        Yet the General Assembly has for two years refused to pass a bill that would revoke the pensions of state and municipal officials who are convicted or plead no contest to taking bribes or engaging in other corrupt practices. The legislature's reluctance is difficult to comprehend. The state has endured spectacular, and shameful, examples of malfeasance among government officials in the last several years. Yet these same officials can depend on publicly financed retirements.\n        Former Gov. John Rowland, who served nearly a year in prison for corruption, will be eligible to collect a state pension of $50,000 annually in five years, when he turns 55. Former Mayor Joseph Ganim of Bridgeport, who brazenly shook down businesses bidding for municipal contracts, will nonetheless be eligible for a city pension after he leaves prison.\n        Lawmakers have discussed repealing the pensions of past offenders, but such a measure would be complicated and subject to many legal challenges. The least they could do is to prevent corrupt officials in the future from collecting a public pension.\n        In January, lawmakers vowed to write a bill that would set a clear standard of behavior for public officials from now on. But with three weeks to go in the session, Senate Bill 1183 is still a work in progress. It needs to be toughened, and Senator Gayle Slossberg, Democrat of Milford, has promised a new draft worthy of public support. That's good, because the bill approved earlier in committee left it to judges' discretion to revoke pensions of corrupt politicians or leave them intact. Such leeway renders the bill almost meaningless and puts judges under unnecessary political pressure.\n        Senator Slossberg proposes wording that would ensure that future high-level officials will lose their pensions if they are convicted of corruption, while allowing judges discretion in cases involving lower-level workers. ''It is so much worse when the governor violates public trust than the worker who inadvertently brings home a box of pencils,'' Senator Slossberg said.\n        She is right. But as they struggle for balance, lawmakers should remember how hard it is in Connecticut to prosecute public officials of such crimes. The chief state's attorney has weak powers to investigate public corruption. The recent high-profile cases came about because federal prosecutors, to their credit, vigorously enforced the law. It is highly unlikely that the feds would swoop down on a secretary who swiped a box of pencils.\n        While they are toughening that bill, lawmakers should pass House Bill 6242, which would give municipalities power to recall mayors or selectmen who hold four-year terms of office. Only five municipalities in the state have the power to recall their elected officials, and Bridgeport is not among them. That is why Mayor Ganim continued in office for nearly 14 months after he was indicted on 24 counts of racketeering, bribery and extortion, finally resigning a few weeks after his conviction. The potential of more such embarrassments will continue unless the General Assembly acts.","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1695197,"ids":1695197,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When a country buys more from foreigners than it sells to them -- as the United States does -- the result is a trade gap that must be plugged by selling off American assets, mostly corporate and government bonds. We've seen that system, for lack of a better word, function swimmingly in the past few days.\n        On Friday, the government reported that the United States' trade imbalance with the rest of the world hit $58.8 billion in June. It was the third-biggest monthly deficit on record, exceeded only by the figures from February and last November, and it led to market jitters over the government's ability to finance its huge deficits on favorable terms. Yesterday, however, the Treasury announced that foreigners poured $71.2 billion into the United States in June, comfortably covering that month's trade gap. The markets exhaled. Stock prices rose, and the dollar gained on the euro.\n        That would be fine, and the markets -- and the American people -- could continue to breathe easy, if the foreign capital flowing into the United States were purely a sign of American economic vitality. Unfortunately, that's not the case.\n        A big reason that foreign money is coming here is that interest rates in the United States are higher than elsewhere. That may -- or may not -- continue for some time, but attracting capital because one's rates are better is generally considered only a temporary advantage. When conditions change, the focus of investors and traders shifts to fundamental strengths and weaknesses -- the underpinnings that determine the long-term health of an economy.\n        Looked at that way, attracting the money the United States needs could well require even higher interest rates than those currently on offer. That's because the United States' budget and trade deficits and its heavy foreign indebtedness are significant fundamental weaknesses.\n        More disturbing still, the trade gap itself is likely to grow substantially and require ever greater foreign financing. The deficit in June was measured before the price of oil rose in July and August. Factoring in higher energy costs, future deficits are likely to be higher than June's by tens of billions of dollars every month for the near future, if not for a long time to come. Even before the recent spikes in oil prices, the United States was on track for a trade deficit this year of more than $700 billion, easily twice the size that most economists consider sustainable.\n        The United States will always manage to finance its deficits. The question is how high the interest rates will have to go. The answer depends in large part on getting the fundamental weaknesses under control.\n        Unfortunately, the Bush administration is crowing about long-term budget deficit targets it cannot reach under any set of reasonable assumptions, while Congress's response to the trade deficit is to blame China. In the meantime, the interest on the bonds that are financing Americans' insatiable appetite for everything from gasoline to toys is piling up, to be paid by the children and grandchildren of today's consumers.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1747589,"ids":1747589,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"When a government employee says ''the greatest terrorists in the world occupy the White House,'' he is bound to raise some hackles, but should it be a dismissible offense? The chief chaplain for the New York City Corrections Department, Imam Umar Abdul-Jalil, made that remark in a speech last year in Tucson before a group of Muslim students. For good measure, he also took a shot at ''Zionists of the media.'' What made the case seminal was Mayor Michael Bloomberg's response. He arrived at a Solomonic solution and, in the process, also found his voice on an issue that has challenged his administration in the past: free speech.\n        In an unexpectedly stirring defense of First Amendment rights, Mr. Bloomberg took wide-ranging swipes at the right and the left for stifling the airing of unpopular or offensive opinions. He stood up for immigrants, the free press, fair elections and justice. He rang the bell for intellectual freedom and for the right to criticize the government.\n        Mr. Abdul-Jalil will keep his $76,600-a-year job, but the mayor announced that he had been suspended without pay for two weeks for his failure to disclose that he had been speaking as a private citizen, not as a city employee. It was a fair outcome. The imam chose his words poorly, at the least. But those comments occupied brief moments in remarks that mostly encouraged Muslims to read the Koran and decried the high levels of incarceration in the United States. And the speech was only one event in a career that Jewish chaplains and other clerics at the Corrections Department have described as exemplary.\n        For the mayor, however, the moment could be much more significant. Mr. Bloomberg's record on free speech took a beating in his first term after he moved aggressively to limit protests, most notably those surrounding the Republican National Convention in New York two years ago. And as a report in yesterday's Times by Jim Dwyer made clear, the Police Department's willingness to subvert free speech in the name of security appears to have gone beyond that one event to an ongoing strategy that included ''proactive arrests'' of political demonstrators who were spotted as potential troublemakers.\n        When this page endorsed Mr. Bloomberg's re-election, we said we hoped that he would make up for his first-term lapses and make protection of free speech a hallmark of his second term. His decision on the imam can be an excellent beginning.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":7,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1690824,"ids":1690824,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"When a piece of insulating foam more than half the weight of the one that doomed the Columbia broke off from the shuttle Discovery's external fuel tank during ascent this week, it not only raised questions about the safety of future shuttle flights, but also called into question the competence and engineering judgment of NASA, its contractors and its oversight boards. This was the very problem that NASA had spent two years and hundreds of millions of dollars trying to correct.\n        The agency took the only reasonable step by announcing that it would ground the shuttle fleet indefinitely while it tried to identify and fix the foam-shedding problem. It should use that time to re-examine whether the shuttle program and the international space station that it serves are worth the risk and enormous cost to keep them at the core of the space program. The shuttle is looking increasingly like a jalopy that has gotten too expensive to keep repairing and may be ready for a trade-in.\n        Fortunately, that piece of foam seems to have missed the shuttle, but this may have been a very close call. The foam broke off at a point in the ascent when it drifted harmlessly away. Had it broken off 40 seconds earlier, as the foam that doomed the Columbia did, it could have hit the orbiter and poked a hole in the shuttle's fragile protective skin.\n        If that had happened, the astronauts would have been in grave peril. They would have been unable to fly back through Earth's atmosphere, lest superheated gases penetrate the hole and destroy the shuttle, as happened to Columbia. They would have been able to try to repair the damage with the tools and materials they are scheduled to test on this flight, but nobody considers those repair kits ready for real use, and a clumsy repair might fail or make things worse. Alternatively, the astronauts could have taken refuge on the space station and waited to be rescued by another shuttle, which would itself face a risk of foam damage.\n        This incident says nothing good about the supposedly meticulous process by which the shuttle was repaired, upgraded and determined to be ready for flight. In the wake of the Columbia disaster, the external fuel tank was redesigned to reduce the risk of foam debris. NASA pronounced the tank the safest and most reliable ever built. As it turned out, NASA had identified the area on the tank that shed the foam as a potential risk, but as one that could wait to be corrected. Either NASA's process for reaching engineering judgments is still flawed, or the aging shuttles, with their millions of parts, are just too complex to be fully understood.\n        As NASA struggles to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it, Congress and the Bush administration need to reassess whether the costly shuttle program is worth the effort. The shuttles are scheduled to be retired in five years, and the main purpose of the remaining flights is to finish building the international space station. Leaving the station half-finished would diminish its scientific value and anger some partner nations. But if the next phase of shuttle repairs looked daunting, a half-finished station might look pretty good.","adu_anecdote":6,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1652422,"ids":1652422,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When a seemingly innocuous remark from the central bank of South Korea makes the dollar tank, as happened on Tuesday, all is not well with the United States' position in the world economy.\n        The dollar has been on a downward trajectory for three years, thanks in part to the Bush administration's decision to try to use a cheap dollar to shrink the nation's enormous trade deficit. (A weak dollar makes exports cheaper and imports costlier, a combination that theoretically should narrow the trade gap.) To be truly effective, however, a weak dollar must be combined with a lower federal budget deficit -- or even a budget surplus, something the administration clearly hasn't delivered. So predictably, the weak-dollar ploy hasn't worked. The United States' trade deficit has mushroomed to record levels, as has the United States' need to borrow from abroad -- some $2 billion a day -- just to balance its books.\n        Enter South Korea. On Monday, its central bank reported that it intended to diversify into other currencies and away from dollar-based assets. And why not? It holds about $69 billion in United States Treasury securities, or 4 percent of the total foreign Treasury holdings. Such dollar-based investments lose value as the dollar weakens, leading to losses that any cautious banker would want to avoid. But as the Korean comment ping-ponged around the world, all hell broke loose, with currency traders selling dollars for fear that the central banks of Japan and China, which hold immense dollar reserves -- a combined $900 billion, or 46 percent of foreign Treasury holdings -- might follow suit.\n        That would be the United States' worst economic nightmare. If it appeared that the flow of investment from abroad was not enough to cover the nation's gargantuan deficits, interest rates would rise sharply, the dollar would plunge further, and the economy would stall. A fiscal crisis would result.\n        Tuesday's sell-off of dollars did not precipitate a meltdown. But it sure gave a taste of one. The dollar suffered its worst single-day decline in two months against the yen and the euro. Stock markets in New York, London, Paris and Frankfurt dropped, and gold and oil prices, which tend to go up when the dollar goes down, spiked.\n        Luckily, the markets calmed down yesterday, as Asian central banks said they they did not intend to shun dollars. While such damage control is welcome, it's no fix. Tuesday's market episode has its roots in American structural imbalances that will be corrected only by new policies, not more of the same tax-cut-and-weak-dollar deficit-bloating ploys.\n        If Mr. Bush were half the capitalist he claims he is, he would listen to what the markets are telling him.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1657678,"ids":1657678,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"When asked why he had nominated Paul Wolfowitz, a chief architect of the Iraq invasion, as the next president of the World Bank, President Bush repeatedly pointed out that as deputy defense secretary, Mr. Wolfowitz had managed a large organization. Even he seemed slightly flummoxed about why a job that is all about international cooperation should go to a man whose work has so outraged many of the nations with which he will be expected to work.\n        Even those who supported the goals of the invasion must remember Mr. Wolfowitz's scathing contempt for estimates that the occupation of Iraq would require hundreds of thousands of troops, and his serene conviction that American soldiers would be greeted with flowers. Like the nomination of John Bolton as United Nations ambassador, the choice of Mr. Wolfowitz is a slap at the international community, which widely deplored the invasion and the snubbing of the United Nations that accompanied it.\n        There was a time when Mr. Wolfowitz might have seemed like a reasonable choice. He served three years as the American ambassador to Indonesia during the Reagan administration. And he was the persuasive communicator who once wrote that security and poverty are connected -- that the solutions to global conflicts don't necessarily lie in arms control, but in poverty reduction and economic development. And he obviously has the president's trust, which he will need if he is going to make the wealthiest nations fulfill their vow to make 2005 the year for development in the world's poorest regions.\n        The capacity of the bank to do good is enormous. In so many places in Africa, Asia and Latin America, World Bank projects are where the rubber meets the road: they include such things as building a well in a village in Mali so young girls can spend their mornings in school instead of walking two miles to a river to fetch parasite-infested drinking water, and building all-weather roads to help 200 million people in rural India. Its decisions can mean life or death for hundreds of millions of people. As a development organization, it lends money to cure market failures, financing projects whose returns would not attract other lenders.\n        We can only hope that Mr. Wolfowitz reverts to his earlier incarnation in his new job. The World Bank requires a leader with a passion for the job, someone who lives, eats, drinks and sleeps economic development and poverty reduction. It is too critical a post to be used by the president to make another triumphalist political point.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1812813,"ids":1812813,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When federal immigration officials raided six plants owned by Swift &amp; Company, the world's second largest beef and pork processor, last Tuesday, they brought Spanish translators. They knew exactly what kind of worker is found in low-paying, strenuous jobs in this country: recent Latino arrivals with limited skills and, in many cases, no legal papers. Nearly 1,300 people -- almost 10 percent of Swift's work force -- were taken away in what the government said was the largest but not the last assault on the underground immigrant economy.\n        The raids have led some people to heap scorn on Swift and, of course, on the illegal immigrants, particularly the dozens of detainees who have been charged with identity theft and other crimes. But doing so misses the bigger picture. Swift and its workers are merely Exhibit A in an immigration system that is failing in all of its parts.\n        It is a system that rewards illegality and pays lip service to lawfulness and order.\n        Swift insists that it is a model corporate citizen. It obeyed the rules, which require it to check workers' identity papers and file so-called I-9 forms attesting to that. And it went further, participating in the federal Basic Pilot program, a system of checking Social Security numbers that President Bush has touted as a way to crack down on immigration fraud. The company says that prying any more aggressively into workers' legal status would leave it open to civil rights lawsuits.\n        The Swift raids are powerful evidence that I-9's and Basic Pilot are ineffective and disingenuous, a nod to by-the-books technical lawfulness that allows a far vaster world of illegality to flourish. Swift and other large-scale employers of immigrants, like farms and hotels, may insist that they never knowingly hire people illegally. But as long as the jobs they offer are the kinds whose pay and conditions consistently fail to attract native-born Americans, their protests will ring hollow. This system is brilliantly efficient at bringing lots of cheap products and services to market, which is great unless you mind its essential lawlessness, anonymity and reliance on an enormous work force of silent, compliant, frightened people whose bitter choice is to stay here illegally or go home and be desperately poor.\n        Swift, by its lights, was doing the right thing. The federal government was doing the right thing, waking up, belatedly, to workplace enforcement. And yet it's impossible to see how this will work over the long term. Immigration reform built on piecemeal enforcement -- factory raids and border walls -- won't solve the problem of the 12 million illegal immigrants already here. The American economy wouldn't stand the shock if the Swift raids were multiplied to levels beyond the merely symbolic.\n        The system needs what Mr. Bush and Congress have refused to give it: a way to end the sham. Comprehensive immigration reform is good for the economy, giving companies access to a secure and stable work force. It is good for national security, allowing law enforcement to go after real criminals and leave honest working people alone. And it is good for the immigrant workers across the country, terrorized by Tuesday's raids, who just want to keep doing their jobs, no matter how hard and distasteful.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":16,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1800285,"ids":1800285,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"When future generations of Americans look back on the current era, they'll puzzle over what it was about George W.

''I mentioned his love for his family,'' Mr. Bush said at a rally for a Republican Senate candidate in Michigan. ''He understands what I know, that marriage is a fundamental institution of our civilization. Yesterday in New Jersey we had another activist court issue a ruling ''\n        The court in New Jersey, for what it's worth, was hardly activist. The State Legislature had given gay couples the ability to unite in domestic partnerships that gave them most, but not all, of the legal protections available to married heterosexuals. The court simply said that both kinds of partners deserved the same legal protection, and left it up to the lawmakers to figure out how to do it. Hardly a thunderbolt from the sky, but Mr. Bush took up the cause of protecting the ''sacred institution that is critical to the health of our society'' as if a cadre of antifamily jurists had just abolished matrimony.\n        All this is, as everyone knows, just a show for rousing the base. If the last month has taught us anything about the Republican Party, it is that homophobia is campaign strategy, not conviction. Congressmen who trust their careers to gay staffers vote for laws to enshrine second-class citizenship for gays in the Constitution. Gay appointees and their partners are treated as married people at official ceremonies and social gatherings. Then whenever an election rolls around, the whole team pretends it's on a mission to save America from gay marriage.\n        Mr. Bush and his faithful acolytes seem perfectly willing to stoke fears that create division and sorrow in a country that doesn't need any more of either.

Were it not for an aggressive United States attorney, high-profile corruption among Connecticut public officials in the last several years might never have been prosecuted. That Connecticut's top criminal prosecutor is essentially powerless suits the state's political establishment just fine. Connecticut residents, however, should be outraged.\n        The weaknesses are as follows:\n        It is very difficult for a chief state's attorney to issue a subpoena for an investigation. The rules require that an application be made to a three-judge panel, which then appoints a one-person grand jury to approve subpoenas. This is absurdly cumbersome. Minor state commissions can issue subpoenas more easily.\n        The chief state's attorney cannot prosecute a case in a particular jurisdiction without permission of the local state's attorney -- one of the 13 independent local prosecutors assigned in Connecticut.\n        The job is appointive and not elective, a situation that exists in only three states: Alaska, Connecticut and New Jersey. But the system here is unique in that a six-member commission composed of lawyers and two judges chooses a chief state's attorney for a five-year term.\n        The system's defenders point out that the present circumstances are an improvement upon the way things used to be. For nearly 300 years, judges alone appointed the chief and local prosecutors. That changed in 1984 when a constitutional amendment established the current system, which adds more voices to the mix.\n        Yet it is the office that should be improved, and if the General Assembly were truly interested in reform it would make the powers of the state's top prosecutor more robust. As it now stands, besides the obstacles to subpoena power, the chief state's attorney has little more than some administrative and budgetary authority over the 13 state's attorneys, who are powers unto themselves.\n        A case in point was their role in the commission's decision to reject a request from the current chief state's attorney, Christopher Morano, to be reappointed for a full five-year term. Eleven of the 13 state's attorneys signed a letter asking that he not be reappointed. His biggest offense seems to be that he stepped on the group's toes by taking high-profile stands and getting on the television news. His detractors accused him of politicizing the office.\n        The commission listened to the complaints, and, in the end, gave the state's attorneys what they wanted: on July 21, one of their own, Kevin Kane, the New London state's attorney who promised more collaboration, got the top job. All this had the feel of inside baseball, with the players deciding who would be chosen.Yet the chief state's attorney is supposed to serve the citizens -- not the Criminal Justice Commission and not other prosecutors.\n        No doubt future chief state's attorneys will tread softly for fear of setting off another palace coup. The office is and will remain no more ferocious than a declawed house cat, with little ability to ferret out the corruption that has embarrassed Connecticut in the last several years.

Some of that could go for areas that Mr. Bush has neglected -- aid to cities, job training and pollution control. And some could be used for increases in areas for which Mr. Bush has asked for more money, such as for veterans' health care.\n        For all of Mr. Bush's talk about fiscal prudence, $23 billion is only about 2.5 percent of the discretionary spending proposed by Congress for 2008.

That giveaway will require the government to borrow to make up for the forgone revenue.\n        Yet, Mr. Bush calls for no restraint on tax cuts. Just the opposite. His administration's biggest criticism of Congress's budget is that it includes a ''pay-go'' rule requiring future tax cuts to be paid for, either by pairing them with tax increases or with cuts in entitlement spending.\n        Unable to brook even the possibility that taxes may someday have to go up, Mr. Bush proposes to offset future new spending on Medicare, Social Security and other big entitlements through cuts in other entitlement programs. That would guarantee deeper cuts than would otherwise be required. The Bush budget strategy boils down to never-ending tax cuts for the rich, big increases for the Pentagon and spending cuts for everything else.\n        When it's suggested that Mr. Bush's approach is overly harsh, the White House insists that the president has other generous impulses. Last February, they note, he recommended that Congress provide more money in 2008 for such areas as international affairs, veterans' hospital care, the National Science Foundation and NASA.\n        But that brings us back to his veto threat. If he means what he says, Mr. Bush will veto spending by Congress that fails to achieve $10 billion in net cuts, even if those bills include the new money he asked for. The fact remains that Mr. Bush's misguided war and his misguided tax cuts are what stand in the way of responsible, responsive budgeting.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1690131,"ids":1690131,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When news organizations reported last week that Judge John Roberts, the Supreme Court nominee, was a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, the White House forcefully denied it. But it now appears that if he was not a member, he had a status that looked very much like a member's. This apparent contradiction raises questions about how forthcoming Mr. Roberts and the White House have been. But it is also a reminder of a major concern about this nomination: a few Washington insiders seem to know a lot more about him than the Senate or the American people.\n        Last week, the White House denied that Mr. Roberts had ever been a member of the Federalist Society. Mr. Roberts's handlers were no doubt concerned that the society's reputation as an organization of hard-line conservatives could work against him during the confirmation process. The White House even persuaded several news organizations that had called him a member to print corrections. But The Washington Post reported yesterday that he was listed in a Federalist Society Lawyers' Division Leadership Directory for 1997-1998 as a member of the steering committee of the Washington chapter.\n        Mr. Roberts still has no recollection of being a member of the society or on the steering committee, according to the White House. It may be that Mr. Roberts was never formally a member of the society, which keeps its membership secret. But at his confirmation hearings, the Senate should make sure that there was no intent to deceive senators or the public.\n        The questions about the Federalist Society underscore a larger concern. For a politically well-connected lawyer and sitting judge, Mr. Roberts has a remarkably opaque record when it comes to his views on controversial issues. The American public has little to go on in evaluating his politics or legal philosophy. But at the same time, leaders of conservative groups seem to know enough to declare that they are delighted with his selection and confident that he will side with them on the court.\n        This should not be a matter for discussion only among the members of cloistered clubs who know the secret handshake. The public has a right to know more about Mr. Roberts's views on the law before the Senate votes on his nomination for one of the most powerful positions in the nation. And ordinary Americans are entitled to know just as much about him as Washington insiders and special interest groups. At the confirmation hearings, questions about Mr. Roberts's role with the Federalist Society, and the confusion about it, should lead to a broader discussion of who he is, and how he views the law.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1677057,"ids":1677057,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When the East Coast and Midwest were hit by a blackout in 2003, the first fear of many people was that terrorists had attacked the electricity grid. It turned out not to have been terrorism, but the fears were well founded. Experts have long warned that the nation's power, transportation and communications systems are vulnerable to ''cyberattacks'' that could devastate the economy and cause huge damage to life and property. Now a new government report has concluded that far too little is being done to close these gaps.\n        After Sept. 11, 2001, a group of leading scientists sent a stern warning to President Bush about the danger of a computer-based terrorist attack on the nation's infrastructure. They called for the creation of a major Cyber-Warfare Defense Project, modeled on the Manhattan Project, to prevent, detect and respond to potential attacks. ''Fast and resolute mitigating action is needed to avoid national disaster,'' the scientists warned.\n        Power grids, water treatment and distribution systems, major dams, and oil and chemical refineries are all controlled today by networked computers. Computers make the nation's infrastructure far more efficient, but they also make it more vulnerable. A well-planned cyberattack could black out large parts of the country, cut off water supplies or worse. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that in 2003 a malicious, invasive program called the Slammer worm infected the computer network at a nuclear power plant and disabled its safety monitoring system for nearly five hours.\n        Despite the warnings after 9\/11 -- and again after the 2003 blackout -- disturbingly little has been done. The Government Accountability Office did a rigorous review of the Department of Homeland Security's progress on every aspect of computer security, and its findings are not reassuring. It found that the department has not yet developed assessments of the threat of a cyberattack or of how vulnerable major computer systems are to such an attack, nor has it created plans for recovering key Internet functions in case of an attack. The report also expressed concern that many of the department's senior cybersecurity officials have left in the past year. Representative Zoe Lofgren, the California Democrat who was among those who requested the G.A.O. report, said last week that it proved that ''a national plan to secure our cybernetworks is virtually nonexistent.''\n        Protecting the nation from a potentially devastating cyberattack is not easy. The technological challenges are considerable -- even major technology companies have trouble defending themselves against hackers. The number of potential targets is enormous. And because many of the targets are in private hands, the Department of Homeland Security has to work with entities that may be reluctant to follow the government's lead.\n        But overcoming these obstacles should be a high priority. One of the lessons of the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington was how much damage a few men with simple weapons, like box cutters, could do if they targeted a point of maximum vulnerability. In a well-planned cyberattack, a single terrorist with nothing more than a computer and Internet access could do an extraordinary amount of harm from half a world away.\n        An Insecure Nation: Editorials in this series remain online at nytimes.com\/insecurenation.\n        Editorial: An Insecure Nation","adu_anecdote":12,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":4,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1799881,"ids":1799881,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When the full encyclopedia of Bush administration misfeasance in Iraq is compiled, it will have to include a lengthy section on the contracting fiascos that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars in the name of rebuilding the country. It isn't only money that was lost. Washington's disgraceful failure to deliver on its promises to restore electricity, water and oil distribution, and to rebuild education and health facilities, turned millions of once sympathetic Iraqis against the American presence.\n        Their discovery that the world's richest, most technologically advanced country could not restore basic services to minimal prewar levels left an impression of American weakness and, worse, of indifference to the well-being of ordinary Iraqis. That further poisoned a situation already soured by White House intelligence breakdowns, military misjudgments and political blunders.\n        The latest contracting revelations came in a report issued Tuesday by the office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. The office reviewed records covering $1.3 billion out of the $18.4 billion that Congress voted for Iraq reconstruction two years ago. Reported overhead costs ran from a low of 11 percent for several contracts awarded to Lucent to a high of 55 percent for, you guessed it, the Halliburton subsidiary, KBR Inc.\n        On similar projects in the United States, overhead is typically just a few percent. Given the difficult security environment in Iraq, overhead was expected to run closer to 10 percent. But in many of the contracts examined, it ran much, much higher, in some cases consuming over half the allocated funds. And the report may have actually underestimated total overhead because the government agencies that were supposed to be supervising these reconstruction projects sometimes failed to systematically track overhead expenses.\n        The main explanation for these excessive overhead rates turned out to be not special security costs but simply the costly down time that resulted from sending workers and equipment to Iraq months before there was any actual work for them to do. That is yet another example of the shoddy contract writing, lax oversight and absent supervision that has consistently characterized Washington's approach to Iraq reconstruction from the start.\n        Bush administration incompetence, not corporate greed, is the chief culprit. Still, these charges are one more example of how the favored American companies lucky enough to be awarded reconstruction contracts made large sums of money while the Iraqis failed to get most of the promised benefits.\n        As Americans now look for explanations of how things went so horribly wrong in Iraq, they should not overlook the shameful breakdowns in reconstruction contracting. They need to insist that Congress impose tough new rules on the Pentagon to ensure more competitive bidding, tighter contract writing and more rigorous supervision. That is the best way to ensure that such a costly and damaging failure never happens again.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1776311,"ids":1776311,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When the state's top three elected officials announced that they had a budget deal on July 6, one of them, Senate President Richard J. Codey, spontaneously vowed that Trenton would never again see the likes of this year's budget stalemate. Next time, Mr. Codey promised, the real work of political give and take will start earlier and finish with time to spare.\n        That would be a good result from this year's dismal proceedings. But it may take more than good intentions to achieve Mr. Codey's goal. Politicians, in Trenton and elsewhere, tend to put off things like tough budget negotiations until the last minute. New Jersey lawmakers are not alone in decision avoidance -- just ask New Yorkers, accustomed as they are to blown budget deadlines.\n        Several bills that would change the broken budget system have been introduced since the shutdown ended. One bill, introduced by Assemblywoman Jennifer Beck, a Republican from Monmouth County, and Joseph Cryan, a Democrat from Union County, would require lawmakers to meet continuously in the event of a budget impasse, and includes a provision that would allow the state to function without a budget, as New York does. Another bill, from Republican Sean Kean of Monmouth, would change the deadline for passing a budget to 30 days before the new fiscal year.\n        While some of the provisions of these bills probably are unrealistic and would require changes to the state Constitution, they at least provide a framework for further discussions. But any talk of looking to Albany as a model invites an interesting question. Which is worse: a brief government shutdown, leading to a budget deal, or the long, lingering budget stalemates that have been a feature of New York government?\n        It should be clear by now that the annual exercise in brinksmanship serves only those who benefit from hasty fiscal decisions. Among those beneficiaries are politically connected institutions and organizations on the receiving end of Trenton's so-called Christmas tree appropriations.\n        After all the talk about the state's dire fiscal situation, the Legislature and the governor managed to find room in the new budget for about $278 million in pork-barrel spending. While some of the institutions, such as hospitals and arts organizations, no doubt are worthy of support, these grants ought to be scrutinized and monitored. Instead, they are tossed into the budget during the rush to finish.\n        A saner budget process would allow for more careful review of such spending.

But the real benefit for society is that it protects sources, allowing whistle-blowers or other insiders to expose wrongdoing in government and the private sector. The information they provide is vital to the public's ability to know what government and businesses are doing and to make informed judgments.\n        The idea of shielding reporters from being subpoenaed or questioned about confidential sources is hardly new or radical. A shield law gained impressive support in the last Congress, but got lost in the run-up to the midterm elections. Shield laws are currently in force in 32 states and the District of Columbia, and 17 other states have recognized a reporter's privilege through judicial decisions. There is no evidence that prosecutions have suffered.\n        Yesterday, six members of Congress introduced a new, balanced and bipartisan bill that would allow a reporter to protect the identity of a confidential source in most circumstances. The measure, the Free Flow of Information Act of 2007, is supported by dozens of media companies and other journalistic organizations, including The New York Times Company.\n        The bill is sponsored in the House by two Democrats, Rick Boucher and John Conyers, and two Republicans, Mike Pence and Howard Coble, and in the Senate by Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana.\n        It is not a blank check. The bill would set reasonable criteria that would have to be met before unpublished information could be subpoenaed from reporters in a federal criminal or civil matter. Prosecutors would have to show that they had exhausted alternative sources before demanding information. They would need to show that the sought-after material was relevant and critical to proving a case, and that the public interest in requiring disclosure would outweigh the public interest in news gathering.\n        The bill has strong protections for confidential sources but would permit disclosure to avoid ''imminent and actual harm'' to national security.\n        The Bush administration has opposed legislative efforts to enact a shield law by making the bogus argument that it would hurt national security. The only thing a federal shield law would threaten is the administration's ability to make policy in secret.

But about 50,000 commuters and Amtrak riders learned the hard way Thursday morning. When the electricity suddenly went out along Amtrak lines from New York City to Maryland, riders were stuck for hours, some stranded in steamy passenger cars, some stalled in ''creepy'' underwater tunnels. For most of these travelers, it was an infuriating and frustrating experience. But if their reaction is to shake a fist angrily at Amtrak, there is a far bigger culprit in the nation's capital.\n        Although it's not clear exactly what went wrong with the system, the underpinnings of the nation's railroad system are primed for disaster. The White House and Congress have tried to squeeze every dollar out of Amtrak's meager budget. To survive, the nation's passenger railroad has cut service and raised ticket prices. But what really frightens the rail experts is how little federal money has been available to update the railroad's aging infrastructure. One inspector general for the Department of Transportation warned that the budget for basic maintenance and improvements was so low that Congress and the White House were playing ''Russian roulette'' with the welfare of millions of riders across the country.\n        Amtrak would need at least $2 billion a year to bring the system to a state of good repair, according to the department's analysts. For the Northeast Corridor, where some parts go back to the 1930's, it would take a total of about $4 billion. So far, Congress and the White House have agreed to hand over a scant $600 million a year for all capital programs on passenger rails from coast to coast.\n        Washington power brokers like to say that Amtrak is mismanaged, but calling for better management of a system where the wires and steel are eroding is simply dodging the question. It is time to drop the old bromides and recognize that for the United States to be an advanced nation with a mobile work force, the American government needs to maintain a clean, efficient national railroad. Amtrak does not need to make a profit, but it does need to work. The government directs billions of dollars to roads and bridges. Airports get plenty of help, but somehow very little trickles down to the rails.\n        Amtrak, which at one point was to have received zero federal funds after 2002, has been offered $900 million by the administration for next year. That amount is so low it should be an insult. But Amtrak officials have timidly stayed within the ballpark and asked for a modest $1.6 billion. Even that is just enough money to allow Amtrak to fail more slowly.\n        If President Bush really wants transportation alternatives, it is time for a strategic look at how the railroads can serve as an even more important escape valve for the nation's overloaded transportation system.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1768201,"ids":"1768201,1768328","split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"When they write the history of New York State politics, 2006 will undoubtedly be labeled a particularly strange year.\n        This is the year that control over the state budget has moved solidly into the governor's office.

A slowdown is certainly preferable to an overheating economy, which raises the likelihood of much higher interest rates and widespread unemployment. But a slowdown is still bound to be painful, especially for the Americans -- and they are the majority -- whose wages have been stagnating through much of the current economic cycle.\n        Investors' jubilation was also likely a reflection of their own relief. This week's evidence of decelerating inflation has vindicated the judgment of Ben Bernanke, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, who decided last week to pause in the two-year-old campaign to raise interest rates. That display of acumen boosted investors' confidence in his ability to correctly call the shots.\n        What the market doesn't seem to be considering is the possibility of problems for which the Fed has no good answers. The depth and duration of an economic slowdown will depend in large part on the ultimate fate of the housing boom. As the housing sector continues to weaken, employment could take a big hit; the Economic Policy Institute calculates that housing-related jobs accounted for 15 percent of nation's job growth in 2005. Consumer spending could also be affected, via higher unemployment, less home-equity borrowing and a general reversal in the wealth effect -- that free-spending feeling people get when their assets are appreciating.\n        At the same time, the slowdown is likely to weaken the dollar. Theoretically, a weaker dollar should help the economy over time by increasing American exports. But that assumes that the economies of other countries will continue to chug along, even prosper, as the United States endures a slowdown. Moreover, the ill effects of a housing decline could soon be upon us, while the potentially beneficial effects of a weaker dollar would most likely need time to take hold.\n        The result could be a slowdown that is more severe than currently anticipated and that could be impervious to interest rate calibrations.\n        Of course, that is a scenario, not a prediction. The important point is that today's economy has problems that go beyond price inflation. The last time the Fed successfully orchestrated a slowdown -- in the mid-1990's -- the economy was not coming off a housing boom. The federal budget was heading toward the black, the trade deficit was a fraction of its current size as a share of the economy, and oil prices, while volatile, were relatively low.\n        Now is a time for watchful waiting, not uncorking the Champagne.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1692082,"ids":1692082,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When trying to explain United Airlines' recent pension default, various analysts and assorted lawmakers often use the phrase ''perfect storm,'' suggesting that an unstoppable combination of impersonal economic forces blindsided the carrier. It's a faulty metaphor. Some of United's problems may have been due to avoidable waste and human greed. Congress should take heed, for the sake of the 44 million American workers who are covered by pensions similar to United's.\n        A recent report by The Times's Mary Williams Walsh documents the likelihood that the United employees who collectively lost $3.4 billion in benefits in the default weren't simply the victims of a bad stock market and low interest rates. From 1999 through 2003, Labor Department records show, some 30 money managers, consultants and other professionals that handled United's pensions earned at least $125 million, paid out of plan assets. During that same period, a huge gap opened between the value of the pensions' assets and the amount owed to present and future retirees -- from a surplus of about $2 billion to a deficit of nearly $7 billion. The record is silent on how individual money managers performed, making it impossible to determine who may have acted in a way that contributed to the pensions' failures.\n        Even though the federal government is the ultimate insurer for failed pensions, the world of pension investing is largely unregulated. In United's case, that system allowed money managers to make risky bets that included junk bonds, dot-com stocks and, apparently, an Albanian energy venture. A pension auditor told Ms. Walsh that many pension money managers favor actively traded equities, in part because they generate fees and commissions that can be shared with pension consultants who steer business their way. The auditor's observation is supported by a report released last May by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It found that more than half of the consultants who helped pension funds invest their money had outside business relationships that could taint their advice.\n        Congress and the Labor Department, which oversees the federal pension agency, should swiftly investigate the allegations of conflicts of interest and, if warranted, seek redress for bilked workers and retirees. So far, Congress hasn't broached the topic, and the Labor Department has been unresponsive to a written request from one of United's unions, sent in June, for an audit of United's pensions. There's no excuse for foot-dragging. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal pension insurer, is straining under the weight of $63 billion in liabilities. If it should ever collapse, American taxpayers would be the payers of last resort.\n        Congress should also impose rules to limit aggressive pension investments and to charge higher pension-insurance premiums to companies that engage in risky investing. Lawmakers have long resisted such interventions, mainly on the grounds that they would distort the free market. That's backward. Government regulation is less distorting than investors' misbehavior, that dreaded ''moral hazard'' -- which is unleashed when investors take undue risks because they are protected by insurance and, in the case of pensions, shielded from having to disclose their performance. And charging higher insurance premiums to high-risk clients is simply common sense.\n        Rather than a perfect storm, the United pension debacle may be the tip of an iceberg.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1741150,"ids":1741150,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"When you use the Internet today, your browser glides from one Web site to another, accessing all destinations with equal ease.

A Verizon Communications executive recently sent a scare through cyberspace when he said at a telecommunications conference, as The Washington Post reported, that Google ''is enjoying a free lunch'' that ought to be going to providers like Verizon.\n        The solution, as far as the I.S.P.'s are concerned, could be what some critics are calling ''access tiering,'' different levels of access for different sites, based on ability and willingness to pay. Giants like Walmart.com could get very fast connections, while little-guy sites might have to settle for the information superhighway equivalent of a one-lane, pothole-strewn road. Since many companies that own I.S.P.'s, like Time Warner, are also in the business of selling online content, they could give themselves an unfair advantage over their competition.\n        If access tiering takes hold, the Internet providers, rather than consumers, could become the driving force in how the Internet evolves. Those corporations' profit-driven choices, rather than users' choices, would determine which sites and methodologies succeed and fail. They also might be able to stifle promising innovations, like Internet telephony, that compete with their own business interests.\n        Most Americans have little or no choice of broadband I.S.P.'s, so they would have few options if those providers shifted away from neutrality. Congress should protect access to the Internet in its current form. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, says he intends to introduce an Internet neutrality bill, which would prohibit I.S.P.'s from favoring content providers that paid them fees, or from giving priority to their own content.\n        Some I.S.P.'s are phone and cable companies that make large campaign contributions, and are used to getting their way in Washington. But Americans feel strongly about an open and free Internet. Net neutrality is an issue where the public interest can and should trump the special interests.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1644193,"ids":1644193,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Whenever we hear the words Hudson River and PCB's, our ears perk up and our hearts prepare to sink.\n        Like most of those who have been eagerly awaiting the day when the river's lingering chemical stain is finally erased, we are accustomed to bad news. It is discouraging enough that tons of General Electric pollutants have soiled the riverbed for decades, poisoning fish and threatening people. They should have been dredged up years ago, but lawsuits, squabbles, bureaucratic complications and procedural difficulties have delayed the cleanup again and again. The Environmental Protection Agency, with G.E. footing the bill, currently plans to start work next summer -- assuming that nothing else happens to further postpone what will be one of the largest industrial cleanups in American history.\n        Our latest shudder came from news reports that researchers at the State University at Albany had found disproportionately high rates of respiratory disease among people living along the Hudson River. The suggestion that breathing PCB's could make you sick is both new and alarming -- the main established threat has long been to people who risk cancer by eating tainted fish, and to wildlife in and on the river.\n        Besides the new way of thinking about health hazards, we worried that the study, published in the journal Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology, could somehow lend credence to G.E.'s long-discredited argument that removing the tainted mud would be riskier than leaving it alone. The E.P.A. will have a hard enough time dredging up millions of cubic yards of mud and sediment, processing it, drying it and taking it away. Doing so amid new concerns about airborne PCB's could add a frustrating layer of complications and delays to an already daunting project.\n        Thankfully, a few factors argue for staying calm, at least for now.\n        First, it is far too soon to conclude that this one study proves anything. Its authors used ZIP codes for their population samples along the Hudson and in other ''clean'' areas, a tactic they acknowledge ''is a very crude way to assess exposure, since ZIP codes are large and irregular in shape.''\n        ''The most serious limitation of these studies is the exposure assessment,'' they write. An E.P.A. official who examined the study agreed, saying that using it to finger PCB's as the sole cause of Hudson-area residents' respiratory problems is going from Point A to Point G.\n        The official, George Pavlou, said the E.P.A. was well aware that small quantities of PCB's, oily yellow insulating chemicals, could escape into the air through dredging, but he said the amounts would be minute -- far too small to pose a health risk. He added that the agency had employed stringent, peer-reviewed research to develop dredging procedures that are effective and safe -- far safer than letting the PCB's sit in the mud.\n        This is not to discount the concerns raised by the SUNY study. A group of New York State Assembly members have written to the state health commissioner, Antonia C. Novello, urging an investigation. ''The health risks uncovered by this study are a call to action,'' said Assemblyman Adam Bradley. He is right. We urge the state to examine the risks of airborne PCB's to respiratory health.\n        If such a link is ever found, we hope we can take comfort in knowing that the solution -- dredging the river -- is already well under way.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":13,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1766546,"ids":1766546,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Where in the world can everyone agree that something ought to be done and then not do it?\n        Albany is where.\n        Earlier this year, the State Assembly approved a $50 million increase in the Environmental Protection Fund, from $150 million to $200 million. After serious pressure from a coalition of environmental groups, the Senate agreed to go along. So did Gov. George Pataki, having earlier drawn a line at $180 million.\n        Yet for reasons so petty they make your teeth hurt, the program remains unfinanced -- the actual appropriation has not been made -- and could conceivably disappear altogether.\n        Put simply, the fund has become yet another victim of the annual Albany budget fiasco, a hostage to the deal making that goes on every year among Albany's three kingpins: Mr. Pataki; Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker; and Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno want some things the governor will not give them, and until he does, they will not sign off on the environmental protection program.\n        The fund is the main state source for financing land acquisition, open space protection, critical clean water and clean air projects and other important initiatives like the Hudson River Park that could be early casualties of inaction. The program is financed separately from the rest of the budget by the real estate transfer tax, which generates more than the fund's budgeted level. There is no serious disagreement among the three leaders on which specific projects should be underwritten.\n        Usually the blame for these messes can be fairly evenly distributed. Not so in this case. Environmentalists believe that Mr. Pataki has already gone the extra mile in approving the $200 million and compromising with the leadership on dozens of specific projects. The ball, they believe, now lies in the Legislature's court, since it is the Legislature that is seeking ransom.\n        Mr. Bruno has linked settlement of the fund issue to progress on health care spending and property tax rebates. Mr. Silver seeks to resolve a dispute involving a program called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. The name of the game here is political leverage. As one Assembly member, John McEneny, conceded to an environmental group pleading for help, ''I would like to see a resolution for the E.P.F., but I also know that such a resolution will make it less likely that we will be able to cajole the Senate and, most of all, the governor back into real budget negotiations.''\n        This is more than disappointing; it's disgraceful. A protracted political standoff will not buy the citizens of New York any new forest preserves or conservation easements. It will not close any leaking landfills. It will not build one recycling center or sewage treatment plant, or safeguard one municipal water supply. All it will do is give three politicians a reason to postpone the tough horse trading that honest budgeting requires.","adu_anecdote":15,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1845725,"ids":1845725,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Whether out of blind loyalty or blind denial, most Congressional Republicans are prepared to back up President Bush's veto of the Iraq spending bill. It is now essential that the revised version not back away from demanding that Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, finally deliver on the crucial national reconciliation measures he has spent the last year dodging. And it must make clear that American support for his failures -- and Mr. Bush's -- is fast waning.\n        What Mr. Maliki needs to do to slow Iraq's bloodletting is no mystery. Iraq's security forces must stop siding with the Shiite militias. Iraq's oil revenue must be apportioned fairly. Anti-Baathist laws now used to deny Sunni Arabs employment and political opportunities must be rewritten to target only those responsible for the crimes of the Saddam Hussein era.\n        Without these steps, Mr. Maliki and his allies cannot even minimally claim to be a real national government. With them, there is at least a chance that Iraqis can muster the strength to contain the chaos when, as is inevitable, American forces begin to leave. Mr. Bush acknowledges that these benchmarks are important. Yet he refuses to insist, or let Congress insist, that Baghdad achieve them or face real consequences. Each time Baghdad fails a test, Mr. Bush lowers his requirements and postpones his target dates -- the kind of destructive denial Mr. Bush called, in another context, the soft bigotry of low expectations.\n        Consider the Baghdad security drive. Last week, The Washington Post reported that Mr. Maliki's office had helped instigate the firing of senior Iraqi security officers who moved aggressively against a powerful Shiite militia. After betting so many American lives, the combat readiness of the United States Army and his own remaining credibility on this bloody push to secure the capital, it is a mystery why Mr. Bush would allow the Iraqi leader to undermine it.\n        Then there is the endless soap opera that is one day supposed to produce a fair share-out of Iraqi oil revenues. The Bush administration prematurely popped champagne corks in February when Mr. Maliki's cabinet agreed on a preliminary draft. Now, in May, there is no share-out, no legislation and even the preliminary agreement is starting to unravel. The leading Sunni Arab party in Mr. Maliki's cabinet is now threatening to withdraw its ministers, declaring that it has ''lost hope'' that the Iraqi leader will deal seriously with Sunni concerns.\n        Mr. Bush, by contrast, sees ''signs of hope'' in the Baghdad security situation, urges Americans to give his failed policies more time and seems offended that Congress wants to impose accountability on Baghdad and the White House.\n        The final version of the spending bill should include explicit benchmarks and timetables for the Iraqis, even if Mr. Bush won't let Congress back them up with a clear timetable for America's withdrawal. If Mr. Maliki and Mr. Bush still don't get it, Congress will have to enact new means of enforcement, and back that up with a veto-proof majority.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1702471,"ids":1702471,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"challenging","content":"While few people outside Utah were paying close attention last week, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission authorized the licensing of a private storage plant for spent nuclear fuel rods on an Indian reservation some 50 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. Utah's outraged political leaders pledged to use every legal and political trick available to block the project even though, as representatives of a very conservative state, they supposedly abhor bureaucratic or judicial interference with private corporate decisions. Their contention -- that the storage site, backed by a consortium of eight utilities, would pose a safety hazard -- seems overblown. If the project should clear all of the remaining regulatory, legal and commercial hurdles, it could provide a useful interim storage site while the nation seeks a more permanent burial site deep underground.\n        The government's long-term goal is to bury the waste in stable geologic formations that will be resistant to leaks for eons to come. Unfortunately, progress has been slow. The only site approved for evaluation -- at Yucca Mountain in Nevada -- has been hobbled by technical problems and legal challenges. Meanwhile, spent fuel rods have been piling up in cooling pools and in dry-storage casks at nuclear reactor sites around the country.\n        So far as is known, the used fuel rods can be left there safely for decades. But it becomes awkward and costly to guard and maintain the storage casks after the reactors themselves have been retired from service. Several reactors have already been shut down, and more are apt to follow. In some cases, the spent fuel rods sit on land that might have more valuable uses. Unless these used fuel rods can be sent to Yucca, a destination that has not yet been approved to receive them, it seems desirable to have a backup site.\n        The question of whether Utah is the best place for such a site has never been addressed. Private Fuel Storage, a company set up by the utilities, simply negotiated a deal with a small, poor Indian tribe, the Skull Valley Goshutes, for an undisclosed but presumably substantial amount of money. The site seems safe enough. The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission -- both charged with protecting the public from nuclear hazards -- approved the project after an exhaustive eight-year process.\n        There are still hurdles to clear before the site can be developed. The state plans to appeal the decision in federal courts. It will also try to persuade the Bureau of Indian Affairs to withhold approval of the lease and will ask the Bureau of Land Management to deny a right of way needed for a rail spur to haul spent fuel to the site. So there is plenty of room for political interference should the Bush administration wish to do Utah a favor.\n        Meanwhile, Private Fuel Storage will need to sign up enough customers to make the project financially viable. Some utilities in the consortium are reported to be in no great rush to ship fuel rods to the site only to then ship them a second time, to Yucca.\n        We remain hopeful that Yucca can qualify as a permanent disposal site. But if Yucca fails to pass muster with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the nation will need a centralized surface site to fill the gap until a safe burial location can be found. The Indian reservation in Utah can fill that purpose.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":17,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1786910,"ids":1786910,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"While space enthusiasts have focused on NASA's preparations for the next shuttle launching and its award of a huge contract to develop the next spaceship for human flight, a battle has erupted outside the limelight between the agency's administrator and some of his top scientific advisers. Two scientists have been forced to resign from NASA's Advisory Council, the agency's top advisory group, and a third has resigned without being asked to. The merits of the struggle are hard for outsiders to assess, but the passions unleashed in recent weeks may bode ill for the sound planning of space research in the future.\n        The struggle comes at a time when unmanned scientific missions, after many years of substantial growth, have been reined in because of NASA's need to spend large sums on resurrecting the shuttle program, completing the space station and developing a spacecraft to replace the ailing shuttles. As Michael Griffin, the NASA administrator, sees it, too many scientists are unwilling to accept that reality and end up offering advice that falls beyond the priorities set by the president and Congress.\n        Some dissenting scientists respond that they are not trying to subvert political priorities but are mostly concerned that Mr. Griffin has done away with a longstanding advisory structure in which panels of scientists fed their suggestions directly to administrators responsible for research programs. Now such suggestions must be sent up through the advisory council chairman and then to Mr. Griffin and back down to the responsible official, with plenty of room for dilution on the way. The process is far less effective than direct contact, they complain.\n        Still, the administrator has every right to set up whatever process that best meets his needs. In a rebuke to council members, Mr. Griffin charged that by ''effectiveness'' the scientific community really means ''the extent to which we are able to get NASA to do what we want them to do.'' He considers it an obvious conflict of interest when scientists whose work is largely financed by NASA expect to have a big role in prescribing what work NASA should do.\n        Of course, he is not eliminating any conflict that may exist, but merely channeling it through the advisory council. The main advantage he gets is a chance to see the advice before it funnels into the bureaucracy below him, where it might undercut his own plans for the agency.\n        What the public needs from all this is some assurance that once the passions have subsided, Mr. Griffin will look closely at whether he is losing anything valuable through his streamlining of the advisory structure. And the scientific community will scout around for alternate means to make its voice heard if it feels cut out at NASA.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":8,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1834714,"ids":1834714,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"While the House debates the course of the Iraq war today, the Senate has a chance to restore discipline to the federal budget, a first step in remedying years of damage from profligate tax cuts in the face of immense spending.\n        The Senate's budget plan, now being debated, resurrects the so-called pay-go rule, which Congress allowed to expire in 2002. Pay-go, already adopted by the House, would require senators to pay for new spending on entitlement programs, like Medicare and farm supports, by either raising taxes or reducing other entitlement spending. It would also require Congress to make up forgone revenue from any new tax cuts by raising other taxes or cutting spending.\n        Some Republican senators oppose the pay-go rule on the ground that it would increase taxes, de facto, by forcing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire as scheduled after 2010. That's untrue. The plan says only that if the cuts are extended, they should be paid for. It's hard to fathom why anyone would have a problem with that. Congress's own budget agency has warned that if the tax cuts are extended without offsets, the nation will face crippling deficits and unprecedented foreign debts in coming decades.\n        Some Democrats' discomfort with pay-go is not as indefensible, but still off point. The typical argument is that adopting pay-go now would make it difficult to finance vital programs that the administration and previous Republican-led Congresses have neglected, like health insurance for poor children.\n        The problem is that no politician wants to say what must be said: some taxes have to be raised, for the sake of the nation's children, veterans and others who are paying too high a price for the White House's spendthrift ways.\n        Now is not the time to begin a full-scale debate on the tax code. That will require a new president, one with a true sense of responsibility. But currently, the government forgoes some $800 billion in revenue each year via hundreds of tax breaks. Some, like the mortgage interest deduction, are politically untouchable. But some others are loopholes that Congress could close to raise money for pressing needs. On the spending side, lawmakers could free up tens of billions of dollars by curbing Medicare overpayments, a move that has been recommended by Congress's own advisory committee on Medicare.\n        A pay-go rule does not have to threaten vital programs -- if the Democratically controlled Congress is willing to exert the leadership and the discipline that President Bush and a Republican-controlled Congress have not.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1650400,"ids":1650400,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"While the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is having to take on extremist groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades in the struggle for peace, the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, faces challenges of his own.\n        The parliamentary debate that started yesterday on Mr. Sharon's plan to withdraw from Gaza came with all the overwrought melodrama that usually accompanies any discussion of what most sensible Israelis know is a necessary first step on the road to peace. One legislator from the far-right National Union began reading out loud the name of every settler scheduled for ''deportation,'' adding the phrase ''Jew, designated for expulsion.''\n        Meanwhile, extremists have issued death threats against the transport minister, who is steering the bill through Parliament. West Bank settlers protested in Jerusalem and beyond, demonstrators assaulted the police, and some of those arrested tore up their jail cells.\n        In addition, the housing minister, Isaac Herzog, told Reuters yesterday that the Jewish settlers to be evacuated from Gaza could move to yet another new West Bank settlement. It's no surprise that the Palestinian Authority objected. The so-called road map to peace calls for Israel to stop building settlements on land it captured in 1967.\n        With so much at stake, now is hardly the time for Mr. Sharon to reward Mr. Abbas's efforts for accommodation with this slap in the face. So far, Mr. Sharon has been pragmatic and bold: pragmatic in recognizing that a vast majority of Israelis don't think that hanging on to Gaza is worth the bloodshed; bold in standing up to the extremists who view Gaza as their birthright, despite the Palestinian majority living there now.\n        It appears that Mr. Sharon must be bolder still. Members of his Likud Party often describe the West Bank settlers as ''human shields,'' Israel's first line of defense against Palestinian suicide bombers and terrorists. But those settlements are also one of the largest barriers to any possibility of peace.\n        On the radio yesterday, Israel's vice prime minister, Ehud Olmert, put the choice facing Israel starkly. ''One cannot help but see that we are dealing with a Palestinian leadership which speaks differently, and, it would appear, also acts differently,'' he said, referring to Mr. Abbas.

But the reports, which were released last week by a U.N. investigating committee, reveal far more disturbing problems with the audits themselves, which never targeted the system of bribes and kickbacks that formed the core of the corruption. The great unanswered question is who dropped the ball and why.\n        While Iraq was under U.N. sanctions, its government was allowed to sell oil only when the proceeds were used to purchase civilian goods like food or medicine. The audits, made public by a special investigative committee headed by Paul Volcker, show that U.N. officials did a sloppy job of riding herd on the program. They failed to supervise their contractors adequately or follow up previous audit recommendations. They squandered millions of dollars needlessly, and ignored understaffing at ports and borders where oil exports and humanitarian imports were supposed to be inspected.\n        Those failures surely need to be addressed to restore confidence in the United Nations' ability to manage large international programs. But they are relatively small bore compared with the way Saddam Hussein manipulated the contracts for the oil he sold and the goods he bought. Selling low and buying high, he reaped huge kickbacks, which he used to acquire forbidden merchandise like weapons components or luxury goods that furnished presidential palaces while the people went hungry. The chief American weapons inspector in Iraq has concluded that lax supervision permitted the Hussein government to reap some $1.7 billion this way. Yet the auditors rang no warning bells.\n        The blame lies either with the U.N. bureaucracy or with the Security Council, to which the audit division passed the buck. It makes a big difference which explanation is right. If the U.N. officials overseeing the oil-for-food program were attempting to hide this corruption because they were incapable -- or too corrupt -- to do anything about it, the United Nations' troubles would seem immense enough to justify its bitterest critics.\n        But it's a different story if most of the blame lies with the Security Council, whose members, including the United States, may have overlooked the corruption for their own reasons. Some Security Council members, for example, may have preferred to keep their eyes on the main goal -- denying Iraq weapons of mass destruction -- without worrying about surcharges and kickbacks. In that case, most of the current U.N. bashing would look off target.\n        The U.N.'s own audits turned up no evidence of corruption or bribery, ''no flaming red flags,'' in Mr. Volcker's colorful description. And in an interview last week with Fox News, Secretary of State Colin Powell said responsibility for oil-for-food problems rested in part with the Security Council, ''and we are a member of the Security Council.''\n        If the amount skimmed from the program by Saddam Hussein is $1.7 billion, it pales next to the money Iraq made by smuggling oil out of the country. That had nothing to do with the oil-for-food program and was often tacitly accepted as the price for maintaining international support for the sanctions that kept weapons of mass destruction out of Iraq. Mr. Volcker and various Congressional investigators must distinguish the routes by which Iraq got its billions in illicit revenues, and who made the decisions that let it happen.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":15,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1740531,"ids":1740531,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Who needs sophomoric cartoons to inflame the Muslim world when you've got the Bush administration's prison system? One reason the White House is so helpless against the violence spawned by those Danish cartoons is that it has squandered so much of its moral standing at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Abu Ghraib. This week, the world got two chilling reminders of why both prisons must be closed.\n        On Thursday, the United Nations Human Rights Commission issued a scathing report on the violations of democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law at Guant\u00e1namo Bay: indefinite arbitrary detentions, hearings that mock fair process and justice, coercive and violent interrogations, and other violations of laws and treaties.\n        The Bush administration offered its usual weak response, that President Bush has decided there is a permanent state of war that puts him above the law. And that is exactly the problem: by creating Guant\u00e1namo outside the legal system for prisoners who, according to Mr. Bush, have no rights, the United States is stuck holding these 500 men in perpetuity. The handful who may be guilty of heinous crimes can never be tried in a real court because of their illegal detentions. A vast majority did nothing or were guilty only of fighting on a battlefield, but the administration refuses to sort them out.\n        Some members of Congress tried to exert control over Guant\u00e1namo Bay late last year. But their efforts were hijacked by Bush loyalists, who made matters worse by stripping the prisoners there of the basic human right to challenge their detentions.\n        Now the only solution is to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay and account for its prisoners fairly and openly. The United States then needs a prisons policy that conforms to the law and to democratic principles.\n        The U.N. report followed a broadcast by an Australian television station of previously unpublicized photographs taken at Abu Ghraib in 2003. Many were similar to the pictures the world saw two years ago when the scandal of abuse, humiliation and torture first broke. Others show even worse abuses and degradation.\n        All are a reminder that the Bush administration has yet to account for what happened at Abu Ghraib. No political appointee has been punished for the policies that led to the atrocities. Indeed, most have been rewarded.\n        The prison was a symbol of the worst of the Hussein regime. Now it's a symbol of the worst of the American occupation. Congress should order it replaced. And perhaps John Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, could keep his promise to dig out the truth about Abu Ghraib.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1827046,"ids":1827046,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"With Gov.

Mr. Cuomo's intervention is therefore welcome.\n        He and his staff have developed a new and powerful strategy to make certain that the millions of dollars legislators give away each year -- the so-called member items used to underwrite special projects in a legislator's home district -- actually have a true ''public purpose.'' The attorney general's office is responsible for approving contracts before the state gives out money. This has usually been a rubber-stamp operation, but now the person or entity that gets the money will have to certify that there is no financial connection to the politician who grants the funds. The recipient also has to promise to do what the contract pays for. That means no more handouts to relatives, no more handouts to business partners, no more easy money.\n        This will still not prevent powerful politicians like Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver from routing extra millions to their own districts, but it might make the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, think twice before giving a fat state grant to a company run by one of his business associates.\n        He has started Project Sunlight, which Mr. Spitzer has endorsed by providing money for it in this year's budget. Sunlight is just the thing Albany needs. As now designed, the project would organize public data -- including information about campaign finance, lobbying, state contracts and legislative activity -- on one Web site, replacing a system that is ''balkanized and unconnected,'' as a news release laments.\n        These and other proposals look promising. The challenge for Mr. Cuomo will be to stick to the high road so that the investigations do not smack of politics and appear to be the work of just another ambitious official pursuing headlines and higher office.

To be sure, they have terrific benefits as part of their compensation package, but their salaries are about half what New York legislators earn.\n        Unlike their colleagues in Albany, however, New Jersey's state lawmakers can run for other elected positions, such as mayor or county freeholder. Nearly two dozen legislators hold other titles thanks to New Jersey's generous approach to career opportunities in public service.\n        Voters permitting, other officials -- town committee members and mayors -- are also free to hold additional elected or appointed offices.\n        It's time to ban this practice. Elected officials cannot fairly represent two constituencies. What's more, the practice reeks of pension-padding.\n        Legislators who also serve as mayors say they are better able to bring home the bacon. But legislative districts do not correspond to municipal boundaries. A mayor who also represents legislative districts cannot fairly represent residents who live within the district but not in the mayor's home town.\n        And few people can do two demanding jobs equal justice. While a small-town mayor might be able to some legislative work on the side, it's hard to understand how the superintendent of the Jersey City school system, Charles T. Epps Jr., manages to find time to be a fully-functioning member of the Assembly as well.\n        Given the Legislature's vested interest in the status quo, any effort to ban dual officeholding seems doomed to failure, at least at the moment. But local governments can begin to demand that some highly paid employees work at their jobs full-time, in effect barring them from seeking another office.\n        In exchange for a salary of more than $200,000, Jersey City's students and parents clearly deserve a fulltime superintendent. And cities like Bayonne, West New York and Union City, whose mayors are members of the state Legislature, deserve a full-time chief executive.\n        Advocates for dual officeholding say that voters should be the ultimate arbiters, and if they choose to send their mayor to Trenton, they should be allowed to do so. But double dippers often hail from towns and cities where one party dominates local elections, and thus owe their good fortune not to the voters but to the local bosses. That's yet another reason to reform the system.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":14,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1761661,"ids":1761661,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"With New York State's budget nearing the finish line, it is time for state lawmakers to be thinking about how they will sell this year's achievements to the voters.

The campaigns thus far have been low-key, and because the incumbents are all well known, the challengers are not given much chance of winning. They must fight for serious attention, not just votes.\n        That is regrettable. This is still a democracy, after all. Nobody should be anointed to serve in public office. Elections should be earned after vigorous debate that tests issues and ideas, which in turn makes for more responsive officials and more thoughtful public policies. But that is not happening as it should this year.\n        Consider the race for attorney general. Important issues that have been raised in this campaign are not getting the attention they deserve because everyone is taking the outcome for granted.\n        Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic incumbent, is running for a fifth term. He is popular and is seen as the odds-on favorite. But his Republican opponent, State Representative Robert Farr, is waging a good campaign. A lawyer whose practice has focused on family law, and a 25-year veteran of the legislature, Mr. Farr has focused on the need to make parents accountable when they owe child support payments.\n        Mr. Farr points out that when Connecticut overhauled its welfare laws, many single parents, nearly all of them women, had to get jobs and could no longer depend on the state for support. But the state did not do enough to ensure that fathers supported their children financially. Mr. Farr says that there is an incredible $1.6 billion in uncollected child support here, more than the amount collected annually in state corporate taxes. The issue involves 110,000 cases, although, he says, parents in about 70,000 cases have made some payment.\n        Mr. Blumenthal disputes these figures, saying that many of those cases are inactive and some go back to the 1970's. He says the issue is complicated because it involves three state bureaucracies, and he has over the years proposed laws to make it easier to collect child support payments.\n        Families suffer when irresponsible parents neglect their children. And the state ends up with the bill. If the race for attorney general were generating more suspense, it would shine a brighter spotlight on serious issues like this one.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":3,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1837222,"ids":1837222,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"With all their talk about homeland security, the Bush administration and Congress are doing almost nothing to protect Americans against the danger of an attack on the nation's chemical facilities.\n        That danger is especially acute in New Jersey, a center of the chemical industry. Anyone driving on a stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike south of Newark can get an idea of the risk just by looking out the window. And those ugly, malodorous plants are only the most visible targets. Many potentially dangerous but less obtrusive chemical plants and food processors using toxic refrigerants are scattered across the state.\n        In recent weeks, attention has focused on the Kuehne chemical plant, a particularly vulnerable chlorine factory located near the Pulaski Skyway in Kearny. An explosion at the plant or at just one of the freight cars parked on the plant's rail link could release clouds of deadly chlorine gas that would drift as far as the west side of Manhattan and put millions of people at risk.\n        New Jersey is trying to address the problem on its own. Last month, Gov. Jon Corzine, who as a Senator worked hard but unsuccessfully for tighter safety regulations for chemical plants, ordered 52 plants using or manufacturing explosive or toxic chemicals to develop plans for using safer materials and manufacturing processes, and to involve their employees in the effort. This would bring to 92 the number of plants in New Jersey that are drawing up blueprints for new safety measures.\n        In part because the chemical industry is so important to the state's economic health, and in part because of the industry's influence in Trenton, Mr. Corzine's directive will not require the companies to carry out their plans. However, a company would have to provide a detailed explanation of why it is not following through, which in itself could be an incentive to act. The state has not ruled out making these plans mandatory at some point in the future, and it should do so as soon as it can.\n        Even in their present form, however, New Jersey's regulations are much tougher than the federal rules that are about to take effect. That alarms Mr. Corzine and several New Jersey members of Congress, all of whom fear the Bush administration, under pressure from industry, will try to assert federal supremacy in the matter to prevent any state from enforcing chemical safeguards tougher than the federal provisions. Such a ban would, of course, make New Jersey less safe than it is now.\n        U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg and Rep. Steven Rothman, New Jersey Democrats, have added amendments to the supplemental spending bill for the Iraq war barring federal pre-emption. But these provisions may not survive the legislative process, in which case the administration may be tempted to force New Jersey to weaken its regulations. This might be good for industry's bottom line but not for people in New Jersey and the metropolitan area.","adu_anecdote":4,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":3,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1855058,"ids":1855058,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"With an agreement to stop harassing day laborers and the opening of a privately run day labor hiring site in a village church, Mamaroneck took some long-overdue steps last week toward developing a responsible and humane approach to its influx of immigrant workers.\n        They were important steps, and strikingly positive ones, though they were not necessarily conclusive or monumental. Just as immigration doomsayers must realize that one hiring site will not bury the village in a wave of illegal workers, those who were encouraged by last week's developments must not expect that community tensions will now vanish or that an informal labor market will instantly become tidy and suburban-perfect.\n        The difficult work, in other words, is just beginning.\n        But there is still good reason for relief and praise. Much credit goes to the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit that forced stiff-necked officials to abandon their campaign of using the police to hound day laborers out of the village. The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund filed the suit on behalf of six Mamaroneck laborers and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. Their victory means that the village will end up paying more than $1.2 million in legal fees and other costs -- a high price for litigation that should have been avoided. The village trustees who approved last week's agreement to pay the plaintiffs' lawyers and pull back the police were wise not to gamble more taxpayer money on an appeal.\n        The village's failed crackdown strategy has been replaced by something positive and creative. Villagers who grew weary of all the shouting and litigation should gratefully credit the doggedness of the Hispanic Resource Center, a local nonprofit organization, and the generosity of Strait Gate Baptist Church, whose predominantly black congregation has agreed to let the laborers use their sanctuary and parking lot as the hiring site.\n        ''It's an unusual gesture, and it's a beautiful one,'' Pablo Alvarado of the laborers' network told Fernanda Santos of The Times. There are not many examples of black churches reaching out to Latino laborers in this way, and Strait Gate Baptist, led by Bishop Wayne L. Powell, has set an example that other churches and communities should follow.\n        The hiring site will not resolve the inconsistencies of a failed federal immigration system. It will not erase the anger and frustration of citizens who see illegal immigration as a fundamental breach of American security and values -- like the two hard-liners in baseball caps who went up from Manhattan last week and tried, more poignantly than menacingly, to disrupt the ceremonial opening at the church. Those are big problems that Congress, in all its tortured impotence, has not yet seen fit to act upon.\n        All that the Mamaroneck hiring site will do is help, in a small way, to enhance orderliness in the village, to protect vulnerable workers from robbery and other abuses and to begin integrating them into the community. If organizers get the site running smoothly, its neighbors and others in the village may soon come to recognize that the men (and some women) who use it are not ''locusts,'' as one former village trustee put it, or problems to be managed, or hard-luck cases to be patronizingly ministered to. They are simply grown-ups who are trying to make a living, something that the rest of Mamaroneck -- no longer burdened by hostility, resentment and a hard-nosed, anti-laborer crusade -- can get back to thinking about, too.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1707328,"ids":1707328,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"With less than two weeks to go before a national vote on a new constitution, Iraq's majority coalition of Shiites and Kurds has changed the meaning of the word ''voter'' to apply to people who do not actually vote. It may not make sense as a concept, but it is an excellent way to subvert the entire idea of a democratic process.\n        The new changes to electoral law tilt the playing field in favor of the largely undemocratic constitution that the Shiites and Kurds are trying to ram down the throats of Iraqi Sunnis. There were signs that the Sunnis would be taking an active part in the referendum on the constitution, and relying on protections that give a minority group the power of veto. But under the new interpretation of the rules, the constitution can fail only if two-thirds of all registered voters -- not just the people who participate, but also the people who registered though don't show up to vote -- would have to reject it.\n        The Shiites and Kurds are interpreting the word ''voter'' to mean two things in the same sentence. ''The general referendum will be successful and the draft constitution ratified if a majority of the voters in Iraq approve and if two-thirds of the voters in three or more provinces do not reject it,'' the article in the interim constitution says. The Shiites and Kurds now say the first reference regards people who actually vote, while the second refers to everyone who is registered.\n        That is patently absurd, and Sunnis are right to resist this. They have the support of American officials, who are trying to drive some sense into leaders of the Shiite-Kurd coalition. A United Nations spokeswoman said yesterday that the new interpretation violates international electoral standards.\n        As bad as the Shiite-Kurd behavior has been, it is also important for Sunni Arabs to start assuming responsibility for what they have done to subvert hopes for a peaceful and democratic Iraq. To begin with, they can partly blame themselves for their poor representation in the National Assembly. And few Sunni leaders have spoken out against the terrorist attacks that are turning schools, mosques and markets into killing fields, and are largely the work of Sunni Baathists and jihadists.\n        Every group in Iraq has something to answer for, but the Shiites and Kurds need to recognize that this is not the way to draw Sunni Arabs back from the insurgency and into the constitutional process. Let's hope that the United States and the U.N. both stand firm in not allowing this latest perversion of the democratic process to stand.","adu_anecdote":5,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1753168,"ids":1753168,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"With so much focus on Gov. Jon Corzine's bad-news budget and the state's perilous public finances, it is easy to forget that the private sector is not ordering much in the way of wine and roses these days, either.\n        A recent survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found that the state's economy remains in a rut, with job growth checking in at a measly 1 percent or so during the last quarter of 2005. Last week's announcement that Lucent Technologies, the maker of telecommunications equipment, will merge with Paris-based Alcatel will do nothing to rouse the state from its economic stupor.\n        Lucent, based in the Union County community of Murray Hill, currently employs about 6,000 workers in New Jersey and about 30,000 worldwide. Alcatel has 58,000 workers around the world. The merged company, to be based in Paris, expects to shed nearly 9,000 jobs over the next two years.\n        Nobody knows how many New Jerseyans will lose their jobs at Lucent, but the process will seem painfully familiar. Since spinning off from AT&amp;T in 1996, Lucent has eliminated thousands of local jobs. Corporate prosperity has not followed the cost-cutting: the company's stock price has fallen from $84 in 1999 to just over $3 today.\n        A decade ago, New Jersey was quite literally the center of the nation's telecommunications industry. The state's largest private-sector employer was AT&amp;T. But times changed quickly and drastically, and AT&amp;T sold off its sprawling Basking Ridge campus in 2002. Its iconic bee's nest building became an empty, grim monument to the effects of corporate restructuring.\n        There is little question that Lucent needed help to survive, and the merger may wind up saving jobs that would have been lost if Lucent had continued on its own. But still, the shock value of Lucent's fall from grace should not be lost on state policy makers. New Jersey might well brag about its affluence, median household income, high property values and educated work force, but only a fool would take any of this for granted.\n        The state's much-abused treasury is hardly the only economic problem Mr. Corzine has inherited. He will have to deal with the state's vulnerabilities in industries like telecommunications and technology, once thought to be embedded in New Jersey's DNA. It is imperative that Mr. Corzine's new economic advisers come up with a plan to develop new businesses and create new private-sector jobs. Local communities, heavily dependent on property taxes, inevitably bear the brunt of corporate relocations. A smart statewide strategy will take this into consideration.\n        Politicians once held out the promise that white-collar jobs were the ticket to economic stability. Thousands of New Jerseyans have found out otherwise, a trend that may be exacerbated by the latest news from Murray Hill.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1827136,"ids":1827136,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"With than 5,800 units, Starrett City, situated on 140 well-maintained acres on the eastern edge of Brooklyn, is the largest federally subsidized rental complex in the nation.

A new owner could conceivably maintain the status quo for Starrett's subsidized residents, while trying to develop the site's large tracts of vacant land to turn a handsome profit.\n        But the eye-popping purchase price offered by an investment group called Clipper Equity understandably raises fears that to recoup its investment, Clipper would forego its subsidies and attempt to raise rents, eventually forcing out many of Starrett's 14,000 tenants.\n        It's doubtful, though, that the below-market tenants could secure the subsidy vouchers they would need elsewhere. And even if they could, there are fewer and fewer places for these low-income New Yorkers to go once they've been forced out. The city has been gaining population and losing affordable housing at such a rapid pace that even a heroic effort by Mayor Michael Bloomberg to create 165,000 units for low and moderate-income residents by 2013 may fall short. According to the Community Service Society, a nonprofit monitor, more than one-fourth of the city's 121,000 government-subsidized rental apartments were lost to the market between 1990 and 2005.\n        Hardest hit were rentals, like those at Starrett City, which are covered by Mitchell-Lama, the law giving tax-exempt financing to builders of low and moderate-income housing. The number of these units was cut by more than 5,500 in 2005 alone, with the biggest impact felt in the South Bronx and Harlem. It's startling that with just one deal, Brooklyn could stand to lose a greater number of affordable rentals than the entire city did in one year.\n        The possible end of Starrett City as a working class enclave rightly worries government officials at all levels. Senator Charles Schumer has vowed to block the sale. He has also raised questions about the astronomical bid, noting that if Starrett is worth that much, it is because it was government supported for decades with millions of taxpayer dollars.\n        Alphonso Jackson, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has also expressed serious doubts about the sale. That is reassuring because the Starrett City sale needs both state and federal approval before it becomes final.\n        Our hope is that the deal is quashed quickly, and that state and local officials use the reprieve to concentrate on stopping the hemorrhaging of affordable housing. Even if Starrett is not sold to this buyer, it will remain vulnerable. State law mandates rent protection for former Mitchell-Lama units, but only if they were built before 1974, the year before Starrett opened. Mayor Bloomberg asked Albany to fix the law in 2004, but got nowhere.\n        For the sake of residents at Starrett and in thousands of other affordable rentals, we urge him to try again, and harder.","adu_anecdote":11,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"},{"idx":1775995,"ids":1775995,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"With the circle of violence in the Middle East expanding alarmingly, it is important to be clear about not only who is responsible for the latest outbreak, but who stands to gain most from its continued escalation.\n        Both questions have the same answer: Hamas and Hezbollah. And Israel needs to be careful that its far-reaching military responses, however legally and morally justified, do not end up advancing the political agenda that Hamas and Hezbollah hard-liners had in mind when they conceived and executed the kidnappings of Israeli soldiers that detonated the fighting.\n        The Palestinian Authority, which Hamas controls, and the Lebanese government, in which Hezbollah is a minority participant, inexcusably failed to prevent or halt these incidents. Iran, which arms Hezbollah, and Syria, which shelters the most violent wing of Hamas, also share some responsibility.\n        Israel is fully justified in treating these two incidents as unacceptable acts of aggression. But it needs to better adapt its methods to the circumstances it now faces. The point is to weaken and isolate Hamas and Hezbollah, while denying them opportunities to rally broader Arab support. To that end, Israel must focus its fire much more directly at the leaders and fighters of these two groups, and do far more to minimize the damage to civilian bystanders.\n        Here's why: The military chieftains of Hamas and Hezbollah fully understand that their primitively armed guerrillas and limited-range unguided missiles are no match for Israel's world-class military forces. When they engage in provocative operations, like the recent kidnapping of Israeli soldiers and shelling of Israeli towns, they do not expect to win any kind of traditional military victory.\n        What they more realistically hope for is that the inevitably fierce and devastating Israeli military response will hand them an opportunity to radicalize Arab politics and thereby pressure moderate Arab leaders to distance themselves from Israel and embrace the guerrilla cause. That is a tactic that secular Palestinian guerrilla groups like Fatah pioneered decades ago, and that Islamist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah now use for similar ends.\n        This perverse dynamic is again coming into play after Israel's wide-ranging forays into Gaza and Lebanon. Most Arabs are not blaming Hamas and Hezbollah for provoking these Israeli raids. They are blaming Israel for carrying them out.\n        That is not fair. But it is the way things work in the real world, and the provocateurs of Hamas and Hezbollah and their allies in Damascus and Tehran understand how to use it to their long-term advantage. Israel's political and military leaders need to understand it too and not let themselves be drawn into the provocateurs' game.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1824628,"ids":1824628,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"With yesterday's choice of a new comptroller, the New York State Legislature failed to select the best candidate for the job. Instead, lawmakers -- particularly the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and his Democratic majority -- stuck to their conviction that the position belonged to them. The person they chose, Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli of Nassau County, has been a member of Albany's inbred club for two decades.\n        The choice is a setback for a legislature that is already considered one of the worst in the nation -- and a further sign that its members are not listening to the public's demands for reform. The choice is also a setback for New York's new governor, Eliot Spitzer, who failed to coax or steamroll fellow Democrats into acting in the public interest. If Mr. Spitzer is to achieve the far-reaching reforms he has promised, he'll have to do better with his own party.\n        The choice was not unanimous. Fifty-six legislators broke ranks and backed Martha Stark, New York City's finance commissioner. Ms. Stark is well qualified, and one of three candidates reported out by a screening panel of former comptrollers. But the remaining 150 legislators ignored the panel, even after agreeing to accept its recommendations.\n        ''Everybody likes Tom DiNapoli,'' one of his supporters said during the vote. Mr. Silver argued that Mr. DiNapoli was the most qualified, ''based on his demeanor, integrity and ability to get along with people, staff and others.'' The ability to get along is certainly admirable, but it is not a top qualification for the state's chief auditor.\n        The burden is now on the friendly Mr. DiNapoli to demonstrate that he has the integrity and the independence to audit people connected to the politicians who helped him get this job. He also has to resist pressure to reward his political backers with commissions from the $145.7 billion pension fund he will supervise or with jobs on his staff of 2,400.\n        Mr. Spitzer lashed out yesterday at the Legislature's ''stunning lack of integrity.'' He also pointed out that there had been two elections this week: a special election on Long Island for a State Senate seat, in which the voters opted for reform, and this back-room selection of a comptroller, in which the power brokers rejected it. Legislators are misreading the public's mood if they think this is a good moment to be on the side of politics as usual.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":2,"adu_testimony":0,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1694155,"ids":1694155,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Writing Iraq's constitution would be tough enough without Washington's hard-driving pressure to finish by next Monday. Some of the most basic issues remain hotly disputed, like the division of power between the central and regional governments, the role of Islam in state institutions, and whether women's rights will be protected by civil law.\n        Since this constitution will help determine whether Iraq holds together and whether the ultimate result of American military intervention will be freedom and democracy or a new religious tyranny, it would have been wiser to allow time for compromise and consensus. As that now seems unlikely, whatever document emerges next week needs to satisfy at least three criteria.\n        IT SHOULD BE TRANSITIONAL -- The specific details about regional boundaries, federal powers and the role of Islamic law should not be enshrined in the constitutional text, but left to future elected parliaments.\n        Even with the belated appointment of additional Sunni Arabs, the committee fashioning this constitution is not sufficiently representative to have the last say on these sensitive issues. Ideally, the Sunni Arabs will not boycott the next parliamentary election, as they did the one in January. Sunni participation would produce a more representative parliament, which could then carefully deliberate these issues without externally imposed deadlines.\n        Whenever a broad consensus emerges on these unresolved issues, appropriate language can be added to the constitution through duly ratified amendments.\n        IT SHOULD BE NONSECTARIAN -- Saddam Hussein ran Iraq for the benefit of his own Sunni Arab minority. Shiites and Kurds were discriminated against, terrorized and worse. Now the tables have turned. The current government is dominated by pro-Iranian Shiite religious parties and Kurds inclined toward separatism. That leaves a lot of other Iraqis, including people from every group who put their identity as Iraqis ahead of their religious or ethnic affiliations, feeling excluded and unrepresented. And proposals for religiously inspired changes in family law have left millions of Iraqi women fearing that they are about to become second-class citizens.\n        The new constitution should clearly uphold the human and civil rights of all Iraqis, without regard to religion, ethnicity or gender, and guarantee access for all to the civil legal system and courts.\n        IT SHOULD BE IRAQI -- Iraqis have now been through several ballyhooed transitions that have still not left them completely in charge of their own country. The United States' arm-twisting over the Aug. 15 deadline is just the latest example.\n        While Iraq will never be fully sovereign as long as its government remains dependent on more than 100,000 foreign troops, the country's political leaders ought to be encouraged to stand on their own. With that in mind, the constitution should make it clear that Iraq's elected government must have full authority to decide how long foreign troops should remain in the country, the limits of the authority such troops can assert over Iraq's own security forces and whether any permanent military bases should be conceded to the United States.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":9,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":2,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1845027,"ids":1845027,"split_label":"test","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Yesterday's report on global warming from the world's most authoritative voice on climate change asserts that significant progress toward stabilizing and reducing global warming emissions can be achieved at a relatively low cost using known technologies. This is a hugely important message to policy makers everywhere, not least those in the United States Congress. Many of them have been paralyzed by fears -- assiduously cultivated by the Bush administration -- that a full-scale attack on climate change could cripple the economy.\n        The report was the third this year from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The first report, in February, blamed humans for rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A second report last month warned of famine, floods and other ecological disasters unless emissions were brought under control.\n        The new report deals with remedies. It warns that over the course of this century, major investments in new and essentially carbon-free energy sources will be required. But it stresses that we can and must begin to address the problem now, using off-the-shelf technologies to make our cars, buildings and appliances far more efficient, while investing in alternative fuels, like cellulosic ethanol, that show near-term promise.\n        The report also made clear the risks of delay, noting that emissions of greenhouse gases have risen 70 percent since 1970 and could nearly double from current levels by 2030 if nothing is done. For that reason, it said, it is vital for policy makers to discourage older technologies -- coal-fired power plants with no capacity to store carbon emissions, for instance -- so as not to lock in further increases in emissions, which would make the task much harder and more expensive down the road.\n        From a political and legislative perspective, the report could not have been more timely. A run of fortuitous events -- including the panel's first two reports, increased agitation at the state and local level, and the recent Supreme Court decision authorizing the government regulation of carbon dioxide -- has elevated the warming issue in the public consciousness and on Congress's list of priorities.\n        Moreover, many of the report's proposals have already found a home in pending legislation. Bills to increase fuel efficiency in cars and trucks have been introduced in both houses; Jeff Bingaman, the Democrats' Senate spokesman on energy matters, is drafting a measure that would require utilities to generate 15 percent of their electricity from wind and other renewable sources; Barbara Boxer, head of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has offered an ambitious bill to greatly increase investments in alternative fuels.\n        None of these bills are surefire winners. But by showing that the costs of acting now will be trivial compared with the price to be paid if we do nothing, the report can only improve their chances.","adu_anecdote":10,"adu_other":6,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"reinforcing"},{"idx":1693703,"ids":1693703,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"no_effect","content":"Yesterday's smooth landing of the shuttle Discovery ended a flight that was successful in almost every respect but one: the dislodging of a big chunk of foam, like the one that doomed the Columbia. This flight was supposed to vault the shuttle fleet back into space after a prolonged grounding for repairs. But given the repeat of the very problem that two years of retooling was supposed to resolve, the verdict is necessarily mixed. Once again, the space agency has been forced to suspend further flights until it can find a fix for the foam-shedding, and no one seems willing to guess how long that may take.\n        The Discovery astronauts performed superbly during their two-week mission, and the shuttle looked better than ever in some respects. Space officials were justifiably jubilant that so much had gone well, despite daily hand-wringing over possible perils. The flight clearly achieved its prime objectives.\n        The astronauts transferred tons of cargo to the international space station, which has been limping along overhead with a reduced crew and limited supplies carried up on smaller Russian spacecraft. They replaced a broken gyroscope, repaired another and carted away a load of trash that had accumulated on the station, showing the shuttle can bring substantial loads back down from space.\n        This was the most scrutinized shuttle flight ever, with the vehicle undergoing close inspection while still in orbit. New sensing and photographic equipment to look for potentially perilous damage to the sensitive external skin proved valuable. A new back flip maneuver allowed station astronauts to photograph the shuttle's underbelly, and an extra-long robotic arm enabled astronauts to see parts of the shuttle that were previously out of sight.\n        The flood of images and NASA's openness in discussing its uncertainties about potential hazards sometimes made it appear that the shuttle was about to fall apart. In the end the damage was clearly tolerable. A much-touted spacewalk to repair the shuttle's skin -- the first of its kind -- moved an astronaut close enough to pluck out some protruding material with his hand. Preliminary evidence indicates that Discovery has far fewer nicks and gouges than shuttles on previous flights, perhaps showing that improvements to reduce the shedding of debris from the external fuel tank have had some success.\n        The biggest concern was the nearly one-pound piece of foam that fell off the external tank during liftoff and several other pieces of foam debris that exceeded NASA's size limit. NASA has not yet solved the foam-shedding problem, which it claimed to have largely fixed during the long grounding for repairs. Successful as it was, this flight and the visible uncertainties of its managers left the unsettling impression that there is a lot NASA doesn't know about the performance of the spacecraft it has relied on for the past quarter-century.","adu_anecdote":7,"adu_other":12,"adu_statistics":0,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1693956,"ids":1693956,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Yesterday, Unocal shareholders agreed to be bought by Chevron for about $18 billion in the biggest oil acquisition in years. The deal brought to a final close a sad hostile takeover fight in which a Chinese government-owned company, Cnooc, was effectively blocked from the game by a hostile United States Congress.\n        When analysts and economic historians look back, this summer may well prove to be the turning point in Chinese-American relations, the time when America chose short-range paranoia over rational behavior. From the dozen or so proposals in Congress for across-the-board tariffs against Chinese imports to the Pentagon's rumblings about Chinese military buildups, the rhetoric from Washington keeps escalating. America seems to be on the run, fueled by the false perception that China's rapid economic rise poses an inevitable threat to the United States. By repeatedly demonizing China, Washington risks creating the hostility it fears.\n        The Chinese economic surge has been awesome. If America is going to respond to it reasonably, its leaders -- and the public -- will have to acknowledge the obvious: China is no longer a second-level economic power that can be bullied around. America's financial stability rests in no small way on the continued Chinese purchase of the government's debt. And in foreign affairs, China's concerns will have to be part of almost every calculation. Congress had the power to insert a clause in the energy bill that would make it all but impossible for the Chinese to buy Unocal. But Congress cannot stop China's thirst for oil. Its energy consumption has increased phenomenally, up 65 percent between 2002 and 2004. It is now the second-largest oil market in the world, behind the United States. Among the places it has been shopping are Iran and Sudan.\n        Those oil-market relationships have already created considerable problems for the United States. Part of the reason it was so hard for America and Britain to get the humanitarian crisis in Darfur onto the United Nations' Security Council agenda last year was because China resisted calls to pressure the Sudanese government. Similarly, any attempt to impose United Nations economic sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program now risks running into opposition from Beijing.\n        The scheduled visit of China's president, Hu Jintao, to Washington next month is a chance to put Chinese-American relations on a sounder footing. President Bush should seize the opportunity to muzzle the anti-China crowd who are putting flashy sound bites ahead of America's greater global interests.","adu_anecdote":9,"adu_other":10,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"no_effect"},{"idx":1652153,"ids":1652153,"split_label":"train","liberal_majority":"reinforcing","content":"Yesterday, the bloc of Shiite parties that won the most seats in Iraq's election chose Ibrahim al-Jaafari, the leader of one of the two main Shiite Islamic parties, as its candidate for prime minister. That now makes him the leading contender. But his support base remains dangerously narrow, extending not much further than the 140 national assembly seats, out of 275, held by the Shiite bloc. Others remain in the race, including Ayad Allawi, the interim prime minister since last June. On paper, neither man looks like an ideal choice to lead Iraq through the troubled times ahead. Perhaps a better alternative will surface. But a more realistic hope is that the very challenges of running a diverse democracy may force one of these imperfect politicians to rise to the occasion.\n        Before any candidate can become prime minister, he must be chosen by an executive council whose members will be picked by at least two-thirds of the assembly, far more than the Shiite bloc can supply on its own. That should make it necessary for the successful candidate to provide assurances to the Kurdish, secular and independent legislators that he will respect their constituents' religious, regional and civil rights -- although technically, the designated prime minister will need only a simple majority vote of the assembly to be confirmed.\n        Because of the strikingly low electoral turnout in strife-torn Sunni Arab regions, even a two-thirds legislative majority could be put together without significant Sunni participation. That, however, would be a catastrophic mistake. Reaching out as widely as possible to the disaffected Sunni Arab community offers the only realistic hope for containing the current insurgency and permitting lasting democracy to take root.\n        Dr. Jaafari and his party, Dawa, now talk the language of democratic inclusiveness. But as recently as a year ago, Dawa and its leaders opposed checks on the power of the Shiite majority and pressed to establish Islam as the source of national law.\n        While Dr. Jaafari has begun to distance himself from those divisive positions, he continues to insist on carrying out a purge of the lower-level Baathists recently cleared for reinstatement in government jobs. That would only punish people who joined the party for professional, rather than ideological, reasons and further alienate the middle-class Sunnis the government so desperately needs to win over.\n        The election in January, heroic though it was, will not be enough to make Iraq a functioning democracy or even ensure its future as a unified country.

Cities and towns across the country have overlooked these basics in their eagerness to punish those they presume to have violated federal immigration laws. But thankfully for all of us, the Constitution still has the final say.\n        On Monday, a federal judge ruled that Mamaroneck, a village in suburban Westchester County, N.Y., had waged a discriminatory campaign of ticketing and harassment to drive Latino day laborers out of town.\n        In Freehold, N.J., last week, advocates for immigrants hailed the settlement of a three-year-old lawsuit sparked by similar mistreatment. Day laborers there will no longer be ticketed for soliciting work in public places, and building inspectors and police officers will stop entering homes without residents' consent in what the advocates said was a selective crackdown on Latinos in rental housing.\n        That followed a heartening ruling issued last May, when a federal judge ordered the city of Redondo Beach, Calif., to stop arresting day laborers for violating a local ordinance against soliciting work in public.\n        Together these victories send an important message about basic rights and promise to help stem a tide of local vigilantism. The underlying problem, however, remains. The righteous ardor of the Mamaronecks and Freeholds of this world has risen in direct proportion to the federal paralysis on immigration. It underscores the urgent need for Congress and the president to step up to the perennially difficult task of determining who may cross our borders and how, and of creating a fair and viable path out of the shadows for deserving immigrants who are living and working here illegally.\n        And while the courts have upheld the basic rights of an abused minority, they have not made day laborers any more welcome in their communities or helped local governments find ways to treat them with dignity while upholding residents' desires for a reasonable amount of order. The judge who assailed Mamaroneck, saying it was beyond doubt ''that the village acted with malicious or bad-faith intent to injure the day laborers,'' added that she had also found no law that would compel it to create a hiring site for them.\n        That would be the practical and decent approach, the one most respectful of civic order and common sense.

At a time when concerns about global warming are rising, the Bush administration is sharply reducing the number of satellites that can measure the impact of rising temperatures and a host of other environmental trends.\n        The administration's hypocrisy is stunning. For years, the president and top officials have justified their refusal to grapple seriously with global warming by insisting that more research is needed. Now, after pledging that such research would be the centerpiece of a new climate change strategy, the administration is underfinancing some of the most important efforts to gather data.\n        A report issued last week by the National Academy of Sciences projected an alarming decline in vital studies and monitoring. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration currently has a sizable number of Earth-observing satellites and instruments in orbit, but since 2000 its budget for earth sciences has decreased over 30 percent when adjusted for inflation.\n        By 2010, the number of operating sensors and instruments on NASA satellites that observe the Earth is likely to drop by 40 percent as old equipment fails and is not promptly replaced. Meanwhile, at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, huge cost overruns and technical problems have delayed planned launchings of key climate and weather-monitoring satellites and forced the elimination of instruments essential for climate science.\n        The setbacks are bound to hobble efforts to understand whether hurricanes and heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense, whether ice sheets will collapse and drive sea levels dangerously high, and how fish stocks, deforestation, drinking water supplies and air pollution are affected as populations grow and economies take off. We clearly need more data in coming years, not less.\n        The academy's panel estimates that some $7.5 billion in new money is needed through 2020, mostly at NASA, to conduct high-priority observational missions. NASA's resources are already grievously overextended. It must finish building the international space station, keep flying the rickety shuttle fleet and start developing a follow-on spacecraft to explore the Moon and get ready to travel to Mars.\n        With little new money to carry out these costly tasks, the agency has been forced to rein in other parts of its budget, including earth science studies. Unless Congress gives NASA more funds, the agency should shift money internally to give Earth observations higher priority.

To head off such a catastrophe, Mr. Khalilzad has publicly criticized Shiite and Kurdish politicians who seem far more interested in advancing their sectarian and separatist agendas than in promoting national unity.\n        Mr. Khalilzad speaks from experience, having helped guide a warlord-torn Afghanistan toward constitutional compromise and successful presidential elections. That is reason enough for Shiite and Kurdish leaders to heed his sound advice. They should also recognize that American troops are not in Iraq to underwrite the subordination of Iraqi women to clerical authority or to carve the country up into destabilizing ethnic and religious enclaves.\n        In recent days, there have been a few modest signs of progress. Repeated protests by Iraqi women, a temporary constitutional boycott by aggrieved Sunni Arabs and steady pressure from Washington seem to have brought a partial rollback of some of the most offensive provisions of an earlier constitutional draft. But it is not nearly enough. In the latest version, for example, family law would still be subordinated to clerical authority, with each family permitted to choose which religious sect's teachings governed their female members' lives. The new constitution should not be inventing new ways to entrench Iraq's religious divisions through different systems of law. The right solution is to maintain all women's access to the civil law in these matters, as has been the practice in Iraq since 1959.\n        The threat of ethnic and religious separatism is also unresolved and poses fundamental issues, for both Iraq and the future of America's military role there. The Sunni Arab west and north of Iraq is already a zone unto itself, racked by insurgency, patrolled by Americans and effectively beyond the reach of the central government.\n        Formalizing this split, as most Kurds and an increasing number of Shiites now advocate, would be a prescription for disaster. Nor is this any time to expand the borders of the Kurdish region at Sunni Arab expense. With almost all of Iraq's oil in Shiite and Kurdish regions, the Sunni rump would be left landlocked, seething and economically hopeless, a regional magnet for terrorists and a fount of instability along the borders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria. And as a no-go zone for the new Iraqi Army, it could also turn into a deadly quagmire for American troops. A unified Iraq is the only viable path to national reconstruction, regional stability and an honorable American exit.\n        Washington's heavy pressure to settle all these issues by Aug. 15 -- two weeks from today -- isn't helpful. Arbitrary deadlines are less important than writing a constitution that defends the rights of all Iraqis and allows them to live together in peace.","adu_anecdote":8,"adu_other":11,"adu_statistics":1,"adu_testimony":1,"conservative_majority":"challenging"}]
